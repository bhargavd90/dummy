CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald\u2019s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s growth priorities\n\nToday, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald\u2019s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company\u2019s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.\n\n\u201cWe are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald\u2019s each day,\u201d added Thompson.\n\nSevere weather conditions\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.\n\nOn the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany. McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.\n\nPeter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter.

But that\u2019s not all. The absence of real per capita disposable income growth that has hurt retailers like Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald\u2019s, analysts said. The company also has faced increased competition from fast-casual chains including Chipotle /quotes/zigman/395806/delayed /quotes/nls/cmg CMG and Panera /quotes/zigman/65095/delayed /quotes/nls/pnra PNRA . More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald\u2019s struggling to make itself relevant for today\u2019s consumers.\n\nAccording to the National Restaurant Association\u2019s 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year\u2019s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t kept up,\u201d Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.\n\nA case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.\n\nTo reverse waning demand, McDonald\u2019s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson also is \u201cenhancing the breakfast experience\u201d at the chain to create \u201cmore of a coffee culture.\u201d After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory.

The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.\n\nU.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters.

That was below analysts\u2019 average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.\n\nU.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year \u201cwill pressure margins\u201d in the first quarter.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.\n\nThat performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year.\n\nBeef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year.\n\nThompson said in a statement that McDonald\u2019s is \u201cintent on improving our business performance.\u201d McDonald\u2019s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands\u2019 Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald\u2019s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages.\n\nIn Europe, the company\u2019s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region.\n\nAnalysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning.", "3": "McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather.\n\nAnalysts estimated a 0.1 percent decline, the average of 15 projections from Consensus Metrix. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a statement today, while analysts anticipated a drop of 0.6 percent in the U.S.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, which has more than 14,200 U.S. locations, has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald\u2019s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.\n\n\u201cWeather was definitely an impact in the month of February -- that\u2019s going to be a drag on everybody,\u201d Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald\u2019s, he said.\n\n\u201cThe other players from Wendy\u2019s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they\u2019re taking back some share,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shares fell 0.3 percent to $95.20 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. McDonald\u2019s slumped 1.6 percent this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7 percent.\n\nPressuring Margins\n\nLittle-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.\n\nWhile U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands\u2019s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it\u2019s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.\n\nEuropean Sales\n\nSame-store sales rose 0.6 percent in Europe and fell 2.6 percent in the company\u2019s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne. Same-store sales declined 8.7 percent in Japan last month.\n\nIn February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a \u201cstrong performance\u201d in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald\u2019s said.\n\nComparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer\u2019s performance because they include only older, established locations.

The Battle Royale genre is at its peak thanks to H1Z1: King of the Kill. The biggest Twitch streamers were entertaining thousands every weekend closed beta. And a big chunk of King of the Kill\u2019s fanbase was looking for a fresh take on Battle Royale. I know I was.\n\nOriginally posted on 3/27/17\n\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds finally hit Steam Early Access and what we all thought would happen did happen. Developer Bluehole, best known for Tera before last week, scored big.\n\n$11 million+ in revenue. In just three days. That\u2019s more than 360,000 copies sold at $30/each. It\u2019s actually more when you factor in Steam\u2019s cut (30% is the number floating around). Everyone\u2019s favorite source of Steam stats, Steamspy, shows around 235,000 copies (plus/minus 13,800). These Steamspy numbers aren\u2019t set in stone for any game. Think of them as ballpark figures instead. Plus, Battlegrounds was sold via their own website during the closed beta period.\n\n7/9/18 UPDATE\n\nA recent Valve leak of game player counts gives us a very accurate look at PUBG\u2019s total sales on Steam (as of July 1, 2018). According to the data, the number of PUBG Steam owners sits at more than 36,604,134. The data leak was fixed on July 1, so that number is higher by now. Arstechnica dumped the total player count data for more than 13,000 games into a CSV file. Check it out and see where your favorite games stack up.\n\n6/19/18 UPDATE\n\nPUBG has pushed past 50 million units worldwide according to the developer. That\u2019s combined sales between Xbox One and PC. Toss in PUBG Mobile, and there are over 400 million registered PUBG players worldwide. 87+ million log in and play every day across all platforms.\n\nThe devs are celebrating the huge milestones with a PUBG sale. Starting later today through July 5th, you can pick up PUBG for $19.99 ($10 off its usual price).\n\nBluehole also took a portion of the announcement to say \u201cthere\u2019s still so much we can do to make PUBG a better game for our players.\u201d Yep, there are parts of the game that are still frustrating (loot density, performance issues), but damn I love it. Barely a day goes by where I don\u2019t fire PUBG up for at least a match or two.\n\n3/15/18 UPDATE\n\nWe\u2019re almost at a year since I first published this article, and the Battle Royale genre has exploded to heights none of us would ever have imagined. Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite is turning into a cultural phenomenon, but PUBG is still sitting comfortably at the top of Steam. The latest count from SteamSpy shows nearly 33 million owners. We can add another 5 million more after the folks at Xbox announced the milestone. Check out the infographic at the Xbox Wire post for all kinds of chicken dinner stats.\n\n12/7/17 UPDATE\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since the last update. 20 million sales came and went. 8 months after release and PUBG is still showing little signs of slowing up. Sales are now past 24 million. 30 million total copies shouldn\u2019t be too far away with the Xbox One version coming next week.\n\nJust saw that PUBG is up to 24 million units sold. In 8 months.

SteamSpy gives us a look at how the audience breaks down across the world. The US saw a dip recently as the holiday rush of games begins (Destiny 2?). But that dip didn\u2019t even register thanks to the massive surge in popularity in China.\n\nFor example, yes, PUBG did decline a bit in the US lately but it was offset by skyrocketing player base in China and Korea pic.twitter.com/7iIUk5WxBs \u2014 Steam Spy (@Steam_Spy) October 11, 2017\n\nWe don\u2019t often see hard numbers like this for the Chinese audience, but it shows just how big games can be over there.\n\nSales are also up to at least 15.5 million according to SteamSpy.\n\n10/09/17 UPDATE\n\nPUBG continues its meteoric rise as SteamSpy puts its sales at over 14 million. We haven\u2019t received an official sales update in a little while, but the upward trajectory matches the growth in concurrent player numbers. The 2 million milestone will fall any day now. SteamCharts has the peak player count at 1,984,278. That\u2019s more than the peak player numbers for Dota 2, CS:GO, Team Fortress 2, ARK, Rocket League and Warframe combined.\n\n9/26/2017 UPDATE\n\nPUBG success just doesn\u2019t stop. SteamSpy has the total number of owners at 12.2 million, give or take 100,000.\n\nBluehole\u2019s Battle Royale game already crushed the record for concurrent players, but they still have their work cut out for them to become the most owned game on Steam (that isn\u2019t free to play). The top spot belongs to CS:GO with nearly 34 million owners.\n\nAnother crazy stat courtesy of SteamSpy is 76%. That\u2019s the number of total PUBG owners that have played the game in the last two weeks. That\u2019s crazy retention for a game out six months already. Newer games often see retention rates like this, but they tend to fall quickly. Take Divinity: Original Sin 2. 82% of its owners have played in the past two weeks. But that number won\u2019t stay like that for long.\n\nPlayers are not only jumping on the PUBG bandwagon. They\u2019re staying on it.\n\n9/14/2017 UPDATE\n\n11 million+ now. That\u2019s according to SteamSpy, which has been underestimating the official numbers by about a million. Either SteamSpy is getting better at tracking sales or PUBG\u2019s incredible growth is only accelerating. I\u2019m guessing a mix of both. Peak player counts this morning rose over 1.13 million. The once insurmountable DOTA 2 record of 1.29 concurrent players looks likely to fall soon.\n\n9/05/2017 UPDATE\n\n10 million and counting. That\u2019s the latest sales numbers from PlayerUnknown himself.\n\n10 MILLION SOLD! Never did I think we would reach such a number! Thank you all for your continuing support of the @PUBATTLEGROUNDS team <3 \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) September 5, 2017\n\nA quick look at SteamSpy shows the website lagging about one million behind. Peak player numbers continue to grow with 962,950 playing this morning. It\u2019ll be interesting what kind of impact Destiny 2\u2019s launch will have on peak numbers tomorrow and the rest of the week.\n\n8/30/2017 UPDATE\n\nEveryday brings another new peak player count for PUBG. Today, it hit 887,895. SteamSpy puts sales at around 8.5 million copies right now. This number is lagging as it struggles to keep up with the accelerated growth PUBG has seen in the past month. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the real number is at 9 million or past it already.\n\n8/22/2017 UPDATE\n\nSteamSpy can\u2019t keep up with PUBG\u2019s blistering sales rate. Bluehole announced at Gamescom their hit game has already eclipsed 8 million sales. And that\u2019s not even the craziest number. PUBG hit a new peak player record today with 718,978 players. That\u2019s within 70,000 players of DOTA 2.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if PUBG could ever get close to CSGO\u2019s record peak player of 850,000, but it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing down. It\u2019s looking more like a matter of if than when. A stunning success that has to be exceeding even Bluehole\u2019s wildest dreams.\n\n8/16/2017 UPDATE\n\nWell that was fast. SteamSpy puts sales of PUBG at 7 million+. Peak player counts are surging right alongside with a new high of 614,000+. It\u2019s inching ever closer to CS:GO\u2019s 850,000+ high.\n\n8/11/2017 UPDATE\n\nLet\u2019s check in on PUBG. The hottest game out there continues to sell at a blistering rate. SteamSpy pegs the current sales number at around 6.5 million copies. And it\u2019s an engaged audience. Peak player counts are closing in on 580,000. CS:GO has a comfortable hold on the #2 spot for all-time peak players at 850,000. PUBG has its work cut out to dethrone the 1-2 punch of DOTA 2 and CS:GO. At least, for the all-time peak number. PUBG is already starting to eclipse CS:GO in daily peak players. PUBG had 559,613 players earlier today. CS:GO? 520,209 players.\n\n7/28/2017 UPDATE\n\nFolks just can\u2019t seem to get enough of PUBG. Another week, another milestone. 6 million copies have been sold according to developer Bluehole. On top of that, a new concurrent peak is being hit right now with 429,723 people vying for a serving of chicken dinner. I knew Battlegrounds would be popular, but I don\u2019t think anyone thought it would put up these kind of numbers. And Bluehole still hasn\u2019t tapped into the console market yet.\n\nToday\u2019s new concurrent peak puts PUBG within about 40,000 of passing Fallout 4 for the #3 spot on Steam\u2019s all-time top 10.\n\nAnd that $11 million in revenue over its first three days is now around $180 million four months later.\n\n7/17/2017 UPDATE\n\nThe big news today centers around player count. PUBG has passed one of the juggernauts of gaming and now sits with the fourth highest peak player count on Steam. Ever. With 382,561 peak players, PUBG passes GTA V. Only Fallout 4, CSGO and Dota 2 have higher peak player counts.\n\nAgain, your support of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS astounds me! We just surpassed GTAV & achieved the 4th highest peak player count on @steam_games <3 pic.twitter.com/UGtSJX3GYR \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) July 16, 2017\n\nFallout 4 is within reach, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any game challenging CSGO at 850,000+ or Dota 2 at 1.29 million+.\n\nAs for sales numbers? We haven\u2019t heard any recent official numbers, but SteamSpy shows the game closing in on 5 million sales. I knew Battle Royale was popular and loved it on H1Z1, but PUBG\u2019s success is insane. And well deserved. I can\u2019t stop playing it.\n\nBluehole pushed a more polished Battle Royale experience at just the right time, and backed it up with tremendous support. With continuous updates and new maps on the way, PUBG should only continue to grow.\n\n6/22/2017 UPDATE\n\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds just passed 4 million copies. In three months. Fantastic sales for a fantastic game. Congrats to \u2018PlayerUnknown\u2019 and the Bluehole team for delivering a great game and keeping it up with plenty of updates and fixes.\n\n3 months\u2026 4 million copies of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS sold\u2026 Thank you all again for your continuing support <3 \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) June 22, 2017\n\n6/5/2017 UPDATE\n\nThe playerbase for PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds continues to surge higher. SteamSpy estimates almost 3 million owners for the game. And those buying can\u2019t stop playing Peak concurrent players peaked at 209,081 players over the weekend. That\u2019s just shy of breaking into the top 5 for most peak players ever. No Man\u2019s Sky sits at the fifth spot with 212,321.\n\nDeveloper Bluehole continues to keep fans of the game updated on a day-to-day basis. Updates to fix bugs come every week and monthly updates bring new content and features. Look for another (unannounced) weapon this month. Plus, the team is busy working on two new maps and game modes.\n\nDeveloper support plus a more polished Battle Royale experience than anything on the market right now propelled Battlegrounds near the top of Steam\u2019s charts.\n\n5/20/17 UPDATE\n\nSteamSpy is now showing 2 million owners. We haven\u2019t received an official number since the beginning of the month, but Battlegrounds\u2019 popularity is only growing. Peak player counts are now hitting north of 170,000. Today, 173,386 players were trying to grab chicken dinner at one point. The all-time peak sits at 174,287 players.\n\nDespite the surge in players on Battlegrounds, H1Z1: King of the Kill is proving resilient. It hit just over 124,000 peak players earlier today.\n\nIt\u2019s been crazy watching the growth of the Battle Royale genre over the past year. Last May, H1Z1 was only averaging 8,000 players at any one point. Over the past 30 days, it\u2019s nearly 70,000. For Battlegrounds, it\u2019s just over 96,000.\n\n5/2/17 UPDATE\n\n2 million sales. I can\u2019t imagine how PlayerUnknown and the folks at Bluehole feel passing another milestone. SteamSpy data is lagging a bit as it shows 1,766,374 (plus/minus 36,753). Peak player count is regularly hitting 120,000+. I\u2019ve seen it as high as 140,000 over the past week. A huge success for a great game.\n\n4/27/17 UPDATE\n\nBattlegrounds continues to build on its launch success. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 1,578,332 (plus/minus 36,564). Remember, use these figures as ballpark estimates. Not hard numbers.\n\nThe player rising is rising right alongside the number of owners. We have a Battle Royale near the top of Steam\u2019s top games chart with Battlegrounds and H1Z1 fighting for the 3rd and 4th spot. Right now, 103,254 people are on Battlegrounds. 103,055 are fighting on H1Z1: King of the Kill.\n\nMan, whoever gets their game on console first is going to see a ton more sales. Hell, I would double dip on Xbox One.\n\n4/10/17 UPDATE\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t have reached this amazing milestone without the tremendous support shown by our players and content creators. Thank you all <3 https://t.co/siRiG4CNh0 \u2014 PLAY BATTLEGROUNDS (@PUBATTLEGROUNDS) April 10, 2017\n\nBattlegrounds is showing no signs of slowing down as it breaks 1 million+ copies sold. Huge congrats to the Bluehole team for creating an absolutely awesome experience. SteamSpy puts the owners at 916,186 (plus/minus 27,819). Peak concurrent players is pushing 90,000 daily.\n\n4/4/17 UPDATE\n\nBattlegrounds continues its impressive launch. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 679,209 (plus/minus 23,031). Peak daily players are up 74,000.\n\nOriginal story continues below.\n\n150,000 Twitch viewers at times. King of the Kill was already a popular game among many of the top streamers. A lot of them moved over to Battlegrounds at launch. More than 3,600 Twitch streams have entertained countless viewers. A look at it right now shows nearly 100,000 viewers in the early afternoon. Only League of Legends has more viewers.\n\nYou can see King of the Kill slipped out of the top 10 on Twitch right now.\n\n67,000+ concurrent players. That\u2019s enough to get PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds into the top 10 on Steam\u2019s most played games. Up there with the likes of Dota 2, CSGO, King of the Kill, GTA and Rocket League.\n\nWhile the game\u2019s launch has been incredibly impressive, H1Z1 is still hitting higher concurrent players. Today, King of the Kill hit nearly 110,000 players at one point. We\u2019ll see how the tug of war between the Battle Royale giants shake out over the coming weeks and months.\n\nDon\u2019t expect H1Z1 to go down quietly. Yes, the game is stale for some \u2013 but evidently not for many. It weathered the launch of Battlegrounds better than I thought it would. Still, Daybreak Games has to be feeling pressure from Bluehole. Battlegrounds strengths are King of the Kill\u2019s biggest weaknesses. Weapon variety, the map and gunplay are all better on Battlegrounds.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Battlegrounds doesn\u2019t have its share of issues. The biggest one right now is the servers. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but rubberbanding is an issue. And there are performance issues on certain areas of the map.\n\nBluehole is addressing these performance issues and plans to release patches to fix them. Here\u2019s what the dev had to say in a recent blog post.\n\nOne important thing to note. Client optimization takes time, and will not be solved in one single patch. We will be working hard over the next 6 months to ensure all players enjoy smooth gameplay with no lag or FPS drops.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how they do. For me, Battlegrounds is running fantastic. Outside of the server issues I mentioned above, I haven\u2019t run into any problems. I know that might not be the case for everyone, but the devs seem committed to getting the game running great across a variety of PC and settings.\n\nDid you pick up PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds?

Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.\n\nSome of Bitcoin enthusiast Mike Caldwell's coins are pictured at his office in this file photo illustration in Sandy, Utah January 31, 2014. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart/Files REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\n\nJudge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers\u2019 bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. Mt. Gox\u2019s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n\u201cThis case involves a massive fraud,\u201d said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. \u201cThey claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,\u201d said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt. Gox\u2019s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.\n\nHale\u2019s order protects Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.\n\nMt Gox\u2019s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies\u2019 owners.\n\nThe agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company\u2019s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies\u2019 activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.\n\nSuch is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means \u201cworthless little symbol\u201d in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.\n\nIt was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.\n\nAllard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.\n\nWhen reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.\n\nHe was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.\n\nRepresentatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.\n\nA man walks past a building where Mt. Gox, a digital marketplace operator, is housed in Tokyo February 25, 2014. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.\n\nThe bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver\u2019s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.\n\nThe case is Mt.

Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.\n\nMt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.\n\nThe Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.\n\nRelated: What Companies Accept Bitcoin?\n\nCEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. \"For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it.\"\n\nKarpeles continued, \"Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.\n\n\"The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.\"\n\nEven though all signs point to a bankrupt company, the Bitcoin industry has flourished in general and some signs have even pointed to new ATMs being created to function with Bitcoin currency.", "11": "Follow @csaid\n\nFurious about your Mt.

Gox\u2019s filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.\n\nMt. Gox\u2019s application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\u2019s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations \u201din order to increase repayments to our creditors.\u201d\n\nThe bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt.

Gox filed for Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy protection on March 9, a follow up to a similar filing in Japan in late February.\n\nChapter 15 protection allows for insolvent international companies to benefit from the U.S. court system. It is not exactly clear yet how this will benefit Mt. Gox. The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.\n\n\"Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country,\" according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.\n\nAnother report has the Mt. Gox system being hacked over the weekend with someone breaking into Mt. Box CEO Mark Karpeles blog. The hackers allegedly pulled a spreadsheet showing that 950,000 Bitcoins were still on the books. Other tidbits include that Mt. Gox had around 1 million customers as of December, although no personal data was released by these tech hounds.\n\nKarpeles has blamed his company's weak security system for the original Bitcoin loss.\n\nThis is just the latest in a string of moves surrounding Mt. Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.\n\nBitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.\n\nThat is a lot of money, real or digital.\n\nThen, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has denied he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.\n\nSince then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.\n\nThe urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.\n\nA famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went bankrupt or dying.\n\nThe most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.\n\n\"Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date have failed, in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal,\" wrote Ken Griffith.\n\nThe other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.\n\nAt Hackingdistributed.com Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.\n\n\"Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect, and it isn't, our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions. The exchanges are built on the latest hyped technologies that have incredibly poor guarantees, and routinely run into technical problems,\" the site wrote.\n\n\u24d2 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.\n\nSome of Bitcoin enthusiast Mike Caldwell's coins are pictured at his office in this file photo illustration in Sandy, Utah January 31, 2014. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart/Files REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\n\nJudge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers\u2019 bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. Mt. Gox\u2019s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n\u201cThis case involves a massive fraud,\u201d said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. \u201cThey claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,\u201d said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt. Gox\u2019s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.\n\nHale\u2019s order protects Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.\n\nMt Gox\u2019s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies\u2019 owners.\n\nThe agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company\u2019s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies\u2019 activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.\n\nSuch is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means \u201cworthless little symbol\u201d in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.\n\nIt was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.\n\nAllard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.\n\nWhen reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.\n\nHe was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.\n\nRepresentatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.\n\nThe Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.\n\nThe bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver\u2019s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.\n\nThe case is Mt.

Gox files for US bankruptcy amid new hacker claims\n\nHacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO\u2019s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors\u2019 virtual cash was lost. The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt.\n\nThe Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That\u2019s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.\n\nWhether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage.\n\nAlso unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers \u2013 as well as other details \u2013 were posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles\u2019 own blog.\n\n\u201cWe stole no bitcoins\u201d the hackers added. \u201cThere were none to steal.\u201d", "20": "Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.\n\nThe once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday. This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.\n\nOn 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.\n\nAs Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for Japanese bankruptcy protection (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.\n\nMt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss -- taking place over several years -- was due to \"weaknesses in the system\" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.\n\nOver the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt.

Sbarro expects to cut its debt load by more than 80 percent, and said nearly all its lenders support its restructuring, which requires court approval. The company will invite other buyers to submit better offers. Founded in 1956, Sbarro had tried to boost sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor \"fast casual\" chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. But an \"unprecedented decline in mall traffic\" and an \"unsustainable\" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing. \"Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model,\" said Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York. \"Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order.\" The company said it recently closed more than 180 money-losing restaurants, and expects to shed about 50 more locations.

A common sight in malls and airports across America, the chain closed down 155 of its corporate-owned US locations last month in an effort to return to profitability and has now petitioned a US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for Chapter 11 in hopes that it will be able to quickly settle some of its $500 million debt; the company also listed its total assets around the $500 million mark.\n\nHolders of the company\u2019s debt have already expressed support for the filing, and a group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing as Sbarro attempts to reorganize and cut away at $140 million of the money it owes according to Bloomberg News.\n\n\u201cThe agreement among the company\u2019s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,\u201d said Chairman and CEO David Karam.

Long Island saw three of its seven Sbarro locations shut down due to underperformance. Food court locations in Broadway Mall, Green Acres Mall, and Sunrise Mall were all shuttered; the Smithaven Mall location is still open, as are the two Mama Sbarro locations in Hauppauge and Deer Park, and the Sbarro-owned Umberto\u2019s of Huntington. 220 company-run locations remain open in the US.\n\nSbarro previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011 and began to report losses in 2008 due to the rising cost of ingredients such as flour, pasta, and cheese. During that first bankruptcy the chain was able to eliminate 70% of its debt and emerge from Chapter 11 by November of the same year.

The Army Aviation Engineering Directorate has issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets.

For more information on the book, author signings and related multimedia presentations visit afghanistan.robertnickelsberg.com .\n\nAfghanistan is a hard place to enter and even harder to leave. Everything in Afghanistan, the geography, the weather, the tribesmen, all conspire to keep out unwanted visitors. And once you\u2019re inside this labyrinth of stone, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find your way out. Dust storms besiege Kabul\u2019s airport, blizzards close the mountain passes and bandits or Taliban fighters (it\u2019s hard to tell them apart) ambush the roads.\n\nAsk the British how hard it is to leave Afghanistan. During their infamous retreat from Kabul in 1842, only one survivor out of 17,500 soldiers and camp followers staggered out of the Kabul Gorge alive. Ask the Soviets, who fared nearly as badly. And if history is any judge, the Americans won\u2019t face an easy departure, either.\n\nPhotojournalist Robert Nickelsberg has also found it impossible to leave. Since he first trekked into Afghanistan with the mujahedin in 1988, Nickelsberg keeps going back. He does so out of curiosity, duty and obsession. He was there for the Soviets\u2019 withdrawal\u2014flowers for tank gunners until the Red Army rumbled into the hairpins of the Hindu Kush and fell prey to ambush. He was there for the vicious civil war that broke out when the Soviet-backed regime fell apart in 1992 and Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic groups, the Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks turned snarling on each other. (And may do so again, after NATO forces depart.)\n\nNickelsberg was there for the Taliban\u2019s conquest of Afghanistan, their swift fall after the U.S.-led invasion and the Taliban\u2019s rise again. \u201cThe Americans didn\u2019t grasp how complex this is,\u201d Nickelsberg says, \u201cThe soldiers come and go so fast they barely have time to figure out where the sun rises and sets.\u201d\n\nHis photos bear witness to that complexity, to the savage beauty of Afghanistan and its people. His photos are spare, intense. Every image is stripped down to the essential drama, and in doing so Nickelsberg illuminates the pivotal moments in Afghanistan\u2019s chronology of war and the brief, quiet moments in between, when Afghans catch their breath.\n\nWhen I first ventured into Afghanistan in 1990, I sought out Nickelsberg, thinking, unwisely, that he would keep me from getting shot at. It was quite the reverse. Nickelsberg reacts to gunfire like a bird dog to the rustle of quail. He led me straight into the Kabul Gorge, where in my imagination, ghosts from the British massacre flitted in the ravine\u2019s bottomless shadows and menace was ever-present. Nickelsberg was looking for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of Afghanistan\u2019s more sadistic, and enduring, warlords. Luckily, we didn\u2019t find Hekmatyar\u2019s cutthroats that day, though a year later they would murder my Afghan translator. Following Nickelsberg into dangerous situations, mortar barrages, gun-battles, sieges and ambushes, became a pattern for the next 16 years of my life while I covered Afghanistan. He would get us into jams but he would always know how to get us out. Nickelsberg has longer legs than I do but, in retreat, I always out-ran him.\n\nMany journalists love to dress up like Afghans, with the long tunic, the baggy pantaloons and the flat woolen caps known as pakools. They\u2019re like giddy children going off to a costume party. Not Nickelsberg. He dresses for war as if going for a brisk walk in the Vermont hills, his hair as clipped as a military officer\u2019s, perfectly parted. In the midst of Afghanistan\u2019s chaos, Nickelsberg always kept his composure, his flinty style. And this reflects in his photography: there is a sharpness to his composition, a rigorous clarity.\n\nMost photographers are captivated by swift light, motion and color, which Afghanistan has aplenty. But Nickelsberg stuck around. He bothered to learn about the people he portrays so keenly, the reasons why they laugh and cry\u2014and kill. His photos aren\u2019t just war and gore\u2014though, undeniably, that\u2019s part of Afghan history\u2014but also the quotidian. Two shots in particular, young men dancing at a picnic in Babur\u2019s gardens and warrior Ahmed Shah Masood sitting with his companions, have the delicacy of Mogul miniatures.\n\nNicklesberg\u2019s hard-won knowledge of Afghanistan gives a rare depth to his photos. He wasn\u2019t just snapping a pretty picture. He knew he was capturing Afghanistan\u2019s history, and ours.\n\nRobert Nickelsberg was a TIME magazine contract photographer for 25 years and was based in New Delhi from 1988 to 2000. During that time, he documented conflicts in Kashmir, Iraq, Sri Lanka, India and Afghanistan.

Several U.S. officials, including House Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for the U.S. to increase natural gas exports to blunt the influence of Gazprom.\n\nA long, winding road to market\n\nGetting U.S. natural gas on the international market has been a major struggle for producers for years. The Department of Energy has to approve every export, and the White House downplayed the chances of any major move, saying they don't see exports having much impact.\n\nAs a practical matter, that's probably true. Ukraine's non-payment is a bigger issue than anything, and U.S. producers aren't going to be any more willing to give them free gas than Gazprom is. Still, there's a silver lining to all of this.\n\nGas export complexities aren't a brand new problem, but they're something that has rarely gotten any political attention. The Ukraine situation may be just the excuse needed to get some much-needed attention for this problem, and even if the administration is unwilling to change policies now, with upcoming elections there could be a shift toward more action on freeing the market.\n\nWho benefits?\n\nWith a lot of excess production available, the domestic price of natural gas is not expected to see a major impact from the exports. Prices are higher overseas, however, and having access to those markets at all could be a windfall for major producers, who can more easily grab some of that market share in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe biggest potential winner is Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), the largest gas-focused producer in the U.S. The company is trading at a modest price right now with plenty of room to run, though with a current ratio of only 0.66 and a lot of debt there is more risk there than most.\n\nCanadian-based Encana (NYSE:ECA) is a somewhat safer choice, though it is also higher priced. It is also growing somewhat slower than the industry average, so it's tough to consider it a bargain at these prices.\n\nThe safest by far, in my opinion, is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), which has been putting a lot of money into expanding its natural gas business in recent years. The company has higher margins than the other two producers mentioned, and it has the lucrative oil business to fall back on if the natural gas boom doesn't materialize. It stands as a responsibly priced company that is growing natural gas production at just the right time.\n\nAnd then there's Gazprom\n\nAfter looking at those figures, this is another excellent time to look at the numbers on Gazprom itself, which dropped with the rest of the Russian stock market on the Ukraine crisis, and is trading at a criminally low price.\n\nWhile the other companies are looking at P/Es in the teens, Gazprom's P/E is hovering around 2, and trading at roughly a quarter of its book value. The company has much higher margins than other natural gas-centric plays, and is a market leader.\n\nRather, Gazprom is the market leader, by far the largest natural gas company in the world. The company sees ten times the revenue of Chesapeake, and despite the panic selling over Ukraine, the company is irreplaceable to Europe, and that's true no matter how quickly the U.S. majors can start getting more exports to market.\n\n", "40": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets were set for another tense session on Tuesday as worries about China\u2019s economy continue to reverberate, taking a particularly hard toll on commodity prices.\n\nPedestrians walk past an electronic board showing various stock prices, which are reflected in a polished stone surface, outside a brokerage in Tokyo January 24, 2014.

The weak exports suggest China\u2019s commodity import demand could weaken in the coming months as end-users draw down swollen inventories.\n\nBut China\u2019s imports of oil, copper and iron ore all fell from levels in January.\n\n\u201cFundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,\u201d said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing.\n\nBrent crude declined $1.13 to $107.87 a barrel, snapping a two-day rise fuelled by tensions between Russia and Ukraine that could potentially disrupt oil supplies.\n\nU.S. oil fell $1.25 to $101.33, after touching a high of $102.82.\n\nRussian forces tightened their grip on Moscow-backed Crimea by seizing another border and a military airfield as German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a planned referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine\u2019s constitution.\n\nShanghai steel futures dropped 4 percent to a contract low of 3,221 yuan a tonne, and Dalian\u2019s iron ore slid 5.9 percent to 728 yuan a tonne, its weakest since the bourse introduced iron ore futures on Oct. 18.\n\nSteel demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer and producer, has been weak since the start of the year as a slowing economy curbs demand for the building material.\n\nConstruction activity, which typically picks up from March, is unlikely to spur a strong recovery in demand for steel as Beijing pursues economic expansion that is less driven by investment and more fuelled by domestic consumption.\n\nSpot gold fell for a second session and hit a one-week low of $1,328.86 an ounce, largely due to the strong U.S. employment data released on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.\n\nBut some traders say the disappointing Chinese trade data also weighed as investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts sold bullion.

Now as copper production is growing faster than demand, the market`s slight deficit could turn into a slight surplus - which will have a big impact on prices,\" he said, adding that in his view copper`s fair value sits between USD 2.75 and USD 3 a pound.\n\n\"Copper prices normally see strong technical support at USD 3, if we break below that it could move lower,\" Spooner added.\n\nOfficial data released over the weekend showed China moved into a trade deficit for the first time in 11 months after exports fell 18.1 percent on year in February, provoking concern over the health of the world`s second largest economy.\n\nAdding to the pain was benign inflation data showing consumer prices rose 2 percent in February, the slowest rate in 13 months.

Microsoft has heavily promoted the game since its reveal last June, hoping it will be prove the blockbuster title necessary to help push sales of its new console.\n\nAlthough sales of the Xbox One haven't been disappointing per se, Microsoft is far trailing behind Sony's PlayStation 4 in the console race. According to The New York Times, Sony claims to have sold more than 6 million consoles worldwide. The last sales figure reported by Microsoft was 3.9. In January alone, the PS4 outsold the Xbox nearly two to one.\n\nAnalysts cite the Xbox One's heavy price tag, ($500 as opposed to the PlayStation's $400) as one of the reasons for Sony's success. There's just been little incentive for most gamers to pay the extra money for an Xbox One... until now that is.\n\n\"It's hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,\" Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's chief marketing and strategy officer for devices, said in an interview with the Times.\n\nMicrosoft is hoping that Titanfall will mirror the success of their other exclusive sci-fi shooter series, Halo. More than 60 million copies of Halo games have been sold since its initial release.\n\nTitanfall, developed by some of the same people who created Call of Duty, brings plenty of fresh and new ideas to the table. Set in the ruins of a war torn planet, players will command futuristic soldiers who leap and run along walls parkour-style as they battle one another. The game's main hook is in the ability to switch play-styles by piloting giant mechs known as \"Titans.\"\n\nTitanfall is also unique in that there is no single player experience. Every mode including the campaign is played alongside others online.\n\nTitanfall will be on sale at midnight at several electronic stores nationwide. Players can also download a digital copy of the game if they choose.", "52": "Titanfall is more than just a potential sales boost for the Xbox One, it\u2019s also the first real test of the digital infrastructure that runs Microsoft\u2019s new console. If everything goes accordingly, Titanfall will be available for digital download on Xbox Live tonight at midnight in the United States alongside launch events for physical retail copies at participating stores.\n\nAs Forbes contributor Paul Tassi notes, this is the first major game release since the console\u2019s launch, so Xbox One owners are anxiously awaiting the moment the download goes live to see if Microsoft is prepared for the massive influx of downloads.\n\nEven if the Xbox One can make it through tonight unscathed, there\u2019s the matter of Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform holding up, which will be hosting the servers for Titanfall. After the extravagant failure that was the Battlefield 4 launch, gamers are understandably less than optimistic that the online-only Titanfall will be running smoothly once everyone begins jumping into matches. Here\u2019s hoping EA, Respawn and Microsoft can prove us wrong.\n\nAnd just to wash away any beliefs you might have that Titanfall isn\u2019t going to be the event of the week, here\u2019s a look at Microsoft\u2019s online data centers before and after the game launched in Asia from Respawn\u2019s Jon Shiring:", "53": "The launch of the Xbox One and Playstation 4 last month was met with heavy demand. Especially, for the PS4. Now all we need is software. Most people will probably agree that they are getting a bit bored with the initial slate of software. That changes with tomorrow\u2019s release of Titanfall.\n\nMicrosoft is betting on Titanfall being a huge success. And, everything is lining up for that to happen. Microsoft has been pushing out major updates to the Xbox One\u2019s operating system to address issues in time for Titanfall\u2019s launch. Twitch support will be added just in time for the launch.\n\nThe hype surrounding the Titanfall release is growing to a fevered pitch. Critic reviews have started hitting the web in the past couple of hours. So far, nearly all of them have been overwhelmingly positive. Titanfall\u2019s Metacritic score sits at 87.\n\nSome complaints have centered around the lack of a single player and some framerate issues.\n\nThe big question for Microsoft is how much of a system mover can Titanfall be? No one doubts that it will move hardware, but how much of the Xbox One/PS4 sales gap can be closed with Titanfall?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make comparisons to other system selling games over the years. The gaming industry is a lot bigger than it was when the Xbox 360 released.\n\nPlus, Titanfall isn\u2019t exclusive to the Xbox One. It\u2019s also releasing on PC and Xbox 360. My prediction? 1 million+ copies, probably closer to 1.5 million. Anything below that and I think Microsoft may want to start panicking. Xbox One hardware is a bit tougher to predict. Titanfall\u2019s not coming out around the holiday season where people are more apt to shell out big money for Christmas. I\u2019m going to say 400,000+ for hardware.\n\nIt\u2019s just hard to tell though. We don\u2019t know how many people put off buying a console until compelling software was released for it. I know of a few people who are going out and picking up Titanfall bundles tomorrow.\n\nSony Readies Its Own System Seller\n\nSony has its own heavy hitter coming out later this month. Infamous: Second Son will release on March 21, 2014. If you\u2019re looking for next-gen visuals, Infamous: Second Son promises to deliver.\n\nFans of multiplayer and single player will be treated well in March.\n\nWhat game are you getting? Are you a multiplayer fan itching for Titanfall? Or, want to see the impressive visuals of Infamous: Second Son? Maybe neither? Maybe you prefer the punishing difficulty of Dark Souls 2. Whatever your taste in games, March will deliver.\n\nAlso, let me know your Titanfall sales predictions in the comments below.", "54": "Written by Thomas Chamberlain on March 10, 2014 at 10:47 am\n\nRespawn have today revealed that the Xbox One version of Titanfall will likely see some improvement to the 720p resolution that the game currently has.\n\nLead engineer Richard Baker at Respawn spoke with Eurogamer and said:\n\n\u201cThe target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA.

For day one it\u2019s not going to change. We\u2019re still looking at it for post-day one. We\u2019re likely to increase resolution after we ship. \u201cA lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There\u2019s still room for optimization and we\u2019re still working on it. Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 [fps] all the time when we shipped but obviously when there\u2019s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects\u2026 we\u2019re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.\u201d\n\nIt is nice that they are going to try and improve the resolution after launch, however I am not sure it is entirely needed. In my opinion the game looked fine in the beta and people should be satisfied with the gameplay instead of focusing on the resolution. I do understand that the technical side is important to some people, but all it boils down to is internet arguments where people compare games based on how many pixels it has, which is not very important compared to how the game actually plays.\n\nAnyway, let me know in the comments below if you agree/disagree with me on this subject. Do you think people are putting too much importance on game resolutions?", "55": "Share. Though there's hope it'll be increased in time. Though there's hope it'll be increased in time.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nTitanfall launches on Xbox One with the same 792p resolution it sported during beta, though this may be increased somewhere down the line.\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer, Respawn lead engineer Richard baker confirmed that the possibility of upping the resolution was still being explored, though the team decided to err on the side of caution and release the beta version so as to avoid making sacrifices to gameplay.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\"We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower,\" he revealed. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target.\n\n\u201c The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA.\n\n\"We're going to experiment.

As you'd expect, they look awesome.\n\nLuke Karmali is IGN's UK Junior Editor. You too can revel in mediocrity by following him on Twitter.", "56": "Prior to this week\u2019s upcoming release of Titanfall some early review scores are starting to emerge as respected gaming sites give their impression of this eagerly awaited title. Expected to release on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and the next-gen Xbox One we are intrigued to know what impression this has had on those lucky enough to get an early experience of this.\n\nA review by Video Gamer regards this as a very good first instalment, giving us reason to expect more in the future, as they feel a sequel is bound to be on the cards. Classing it as a tremendously enjoyable game and the 6v6 feature has been praised as a smart move.\n\nThroughout this review we get the impression this game is still yet to achieve its full potential and after testing this for 9 hours they felt it was worthy of an 8/10. Meanwhile, they say some of the maps do feel too similar to each other, branding the campaign multiplayer as sadly non-dynamic.\n\nEurogamer document their views on Titanfall, but refrain from scoring it at the moment as they have decided to delay their full review until they have had the opportunity to play it extensively. With that in mind, their early preview does not hold back and their extensive account is still worth checking out.\n\nThey mention how this game gets so much right and game-changing ideas that are easy to adapt to, in fact, so much so that they feel it is easy to get complacent. We also get the impression there is still room for improvement, and while they regard Titanfall as a step up for shooters, it is not a giant leap.\n\nWhen it comes to review scores Polygon\u2019s 9 out of 10 gives us more reason to follow their perspective more avidly. Condensing their in-depth account it seems Polygon are impressed with Titanfall and suggest this title has all the makings of the next big thing.\n\nIn addition, they reiterate earlier comments about it being a step up, but also remark on this not being a massive leap like that when Modern Warfare started. Overall, some great things have been said about the upcoming title, even though the word potential keeps coming up.\n\nIn a recent post we discussed the Titanfall Xbox One system that gamers were hoping to get hold of, however, this console is only currently accessible to Respawn Entertainment staff, but we are hoping this will be available to the public in the future.\n\nWith plenty of build-up surrounding Titanfall it seems this game is living up to its hype, and we cannot wait to get the gamers point of view. Are you expecting Titanfall to be a top selling title?", "57": "Gaming Editor Kyle Orland\n\nAn online-only shooter like Titanfall is the kind of game you can only fully evaluate on live servers against the full universe of players, so we won\u2019t have a complete review of the game until later this week. We were able to get some quality time with the near-final build of the Xbox One version of the game this weekend, though, playing alongside fellow journalists and developers from EA and Respawn. That time was enough to develop some general impressions of the title beyond our extensive time with the beta.\n\nThe biggest addition over the beta release is in the campaign mode, which takes nine normal six-on-six multiplayer matches on specific maps and dresses them up with a thin veneer of story. A hardpoint area-capturing match might turn into a battle to secure anti-aircraft guns to protect a planet from an invasion (or to protect the invading force, on the other side). A kill-them-all Attrition battle on a dry desert planet turns into a key battle to secure the only convenient fueling station in that area of space.\n\nThese scenarios are laid out somewhat elegantly in 15 seconds or so of voice-over just before each battle starts and through a quick spoken recap of the consequences of your victory or defeat during the match\u2019s final moments. They\u2019re also sometimes punctuated by impressive visual compositions during the introduction. One battle begins with a large wave of AI grunts charging in D-Day style, while another starts with the planet\u2019s native, pterodactyl-like creatures swooping down to take out some incidental grunts (too bad they don\u2019t seem to have much effect on the rest of the match).\n\nNone of this affects the gameplay at all, and it really only provides the barest sense of narrative context for the battles. More than an advancing plot, the story simply hammers home the general impression of a hackneyed, never-ending conflict between an evil space empire and the scrappy militia rebels. That conflict continues on more or less unchanged whether you win or lose, which lowers the narrative stakes quite a bit (to be fair, I was not able to get through all the campaign missions for either side, owing to a lack of opponents during the pre-release weekend).\n\nWhile not objectionable in any way, I feel like most players are going to blaze through both campaigns to unlock the requisite Titan chassis in a couple of hours or so, then promptly forget about it amid hundreds of hours of the standard multiplayer.\n\nOutside of the campaign, there are two new multiplayer modes that have been added since the beta. Capture the flag is like every capture the flag mode you\u2019ve ever played in a shooter, except now there are Titans running around. Pilot Hunter mode is more interesting, giving players points only for killing human players and not for AI grunts or Titans. I felt like this blunted the importance of some of the game\u2019s most interesting additions, but it\u2019s a good corrective for players tired of their opponents farming grunts for points in Attrition mode.\n\nThe full game also opens up a number of weapons and abilities that are unlocked the more you play, in the modern multiplayer tradition. The most interesting I\u2019ve stumbled across so far is the particle wall, a permeable barrier that allows a Titan to shoot out but stops opponents from shooting in. I\u2019ll let Sam talk about the variety of new maps we got to try out this weekend.\n\nAll in all, my initial feeling is that Titanfall remains a refreshing change of pace for an increasingly tired genre, for all the reasons laid out in our beta impressions. With most first-person shooters these days, I get a \u201cbeen-there-done-that\u201d feeling after playing for just a couple of hours. Titanfall is the first shooter in a while that feels fresh enough that I want to play a lot more after an entire weekend of bingeing.\n\nTechnology Reporter Sam Machkovech\n\nThe first thing you might notice in Titanfall\u2019s battlegrounds is a mass of dragons flying around. One of the arenas, dubbed Boneyard, is a giant, hilly desert covered with enormous, sun-bleached dinosaur skulls, and its skies are overrun with winged beasts. The monsters only show up in one of the game\u2019s 15 maps at launch, and they serve no gameplay purpose, at least as far as we can tell. You can\u2019t ride them or shoot them down. Nothing remotely similar appears on any other map in the game.\n\nThe same can be said for pretty much every map that Titanfall ships with, really. The selection doesn\u2019t have much consistency in its aesthetic theme, other than an affinity for vibrant color palettes, robot-friendly expanses of terrain, large draw distances, and unnecessary craziness floating in the sky (more often giant spaceships than dragons).\n\nThe first two maps revealed during the Titanfall beta set a pretty good archetype for how the rest of the retail game has turned out. Namely, maps have been laid out to guarantee plenty of room for the game\u2019s Titans to run wildly and for the weaker pilots to hide and scurry. For the most part, these elements have been rendered as giant, organic settings; the most striking are probably the water-drenched environs of Smuggler\u2019s Cove and Lagoon, whose various buildings and outposts sit alongside sunset-kissed rivers and lakes.\n\nOne particularly impressive map, named Relic, sees its two halves divided by a dormant and astonishingly huge aircraft carrier; the design offers just enough openings for Titans to run in and raise pilot-killing terror while still giving pilots a ton of tactical edge. Meanwhile, Corporate is the opposite in terms of \u201corganic\u201d feel; it\u2019s mostly made up of giant, dilapidated offices at an abandoned tech company\u2019s headquarters, but its mix of giant, rounded domes and climbable, broken interiors stands out as something rarely achieved in FPS map design.\n\nSadly, a few of the maps feel more like they could have been rendered in Halo\u2019s Forge toolset. In particular, Demeter is mostly boxes and right angles, while other maps reduce Titans\u2019 best routes to circuits outside of the maps\u2019 biggest buildings, meaning that your giant mechs wind up chasing each other, round and round, until someone else spawns to create a two-on-one advantage. Maps like this make the game\u2019s lack of level design/customization a little tough to swallow.\n\nWhile the game\u2019s pilots are incredibly mobile, able to double-jump and wall-run, Respawn doesn\u2019t really use these powers to push level design in a vertical direction. Rather, buildings tend to just be spaced out a little further, requiring that you double-jump or wall-run to get to obviously telegraphed points. The speed and jump-crazy mechanics feel great at first, of course, especially in the abandoned-town setting of Colony. Eventually, however, the need to jump all over the place leaves your pilots too exposed, and smarter players will retreat to the more boring, cushy corners of those maps or, worse, to the few high-and-isolated sniping posts that most maps seem to hide.\n\nIn all, the game has at least six absolutely great maps, which is a more than reasonable ratio considering how FPS games tend to launch. As of press time, though, it seems that Titanfall doesn\u2019t include a private/unranked way of selecting an exact roster of maps: even if you party up, you\u2019ll have to rotate through the good, the fine, and the boring in public matchmaking. Hopefully, that will receive a toggle or fix in the near future.\n\nWe can't say the same about our hopes for rideable dragons; we'll just have to enjoy those tremendous robots in the meantime.", "58": "Talk about pressure. The first game from a studio headed up by the co-creator of Call of Duty. The first big third-party exclusive of the new console generation. The game that arrives pre-anointed with 80 awards from journalists dazzled by trade show demonstrations. And all in a stifled genre crying out for a breath of fresh air. Yes, there's a lot riding on Titanfall's shoulders. Good thing those shoulders are made of reinforced steel.\n\nThe twist, of course, is that you're playing as an unusually athletic pilot on the space frontier, able to double-jump up to two stories high thanks to your jet-boosted belt and run along walls, mocking gravity as you go. You also have access to a Titan, a hulking armoured robot that turns you from vulnerable foot soldier to towering battlefield menace.\n\nPeel apart Titanfall's suite of headline features and there's nothing technically new here. Mech suits and parkour are hardly unknown quantities in gaming, but what Respawn has done is to combine these elements - along with a generous spread of other intriguing concepts - with a simple, confident control scheme and a punchy style that not only revitalises these potentially tired ideas, but the first-person shooter genre itself.\n\nPacific Rim and District 9 have both been on repeat play in the Respawn offices, if the game's aesthetic stylings are anything to go by.\n\nThat freshness doesn't extend to the basic narrative set-up, sadly. Framed as a conflict between the ruthless military forces of the IMC and the ragged guerrilla upstarts of the Militia, the thin backdrop for Titanfall's action is as clich\u00e9d as it is shallow. There's a campaign mode of sorts, in which you play through nine matches as both factions, but it's an odd half-measure. The storyline is dull and obvious, with a turncoat defecting from the IMC to lead the Militia - and bolting audio cut-scenes onto otherwise normal multiplayer matches is a poor way of telling a story that's none too interesting to begin with.\n\n\"We're just not used to first-person shooters that play like this.\"\n\nBetter to head for the Classic playlists, where you'll find the real Titanfall experience, and it's surprisingly good. Surprising not because anyone really expected it to be bad, but because we're just not used to first-person shooters that play like this. Where the genre-topping likes of COD and Battlefield have doubled-down on their hardcore player base, Titanfall is a much more welcoming affair. The pace is a little less manic, newcomers will be able to survive for more than 30 seconds without being killed, and the game constantly goes out of its way to make sure that, win or lose, everyone gets to have fun.\n\nThis is most clearly illustrated in the Titans themselves. No matter how badly you play, you'll get to jump into a Titan eventually. It takes roughly three minutes for your Titan to be ready - summoned into battle with a satisfying thwump as it drops from the sky - but that build time can be sped up by good combat performance. Play well and you get the cool toys sooner, but even if you never even hit another player, you'll still get your time in the driver's seat.\n\nIn a way it feels wrong: an egalitarian approach that flies in the face of the unforgiving elitism that drives most shooters. Respawn has cannily designed the game, though, so that things which should utterly unbalance the match and remove skill from the equation actually do the opposite. Getting into a Titan is fun - literally, since the various animations for mounting up from different angles all look incredibly cool - but it's no guarantee of domination.\n\nTitans are made to battle other Titans, and while they can crush players on foot (again, literally), the agility of the human characters makes that harder than it sounds. Add in a special inventory slot just for powerful Anti-Titan weapons, the ability to \"rodeo\" on Titans and demolish them with close-quarters fire and the verticality of maps which allow pilots to hop around like fleas to find better vantage points, and you've got a seemingly chaotic system that actually works like clockwork. Returning to existing shooters after time spent on Titanfall can be jarring - they feel leaden and limiting, and you'll yearn to be able to leap to rooftops and stomp down streets once more.\n\nReview conditions Titanfall was originally played for review at a two-day event in London, hosted by EA. Eurogamer paid travel and accommodation expenses. We then played the game at home under normal conditions after both the North American and European launches.\n\nIf you master the wall-running early on, you'll have a definite advantage - it opens up the maps to whole new areas of tactical play.\n\nYou can even have the best of both worlds thanks to the Titan AI mode. Once it has dropped, you don't have to control the Titan yourself; set it to Guard or Follow mode and it'll act autonomously, gaining kills and XP on your behalf. You quickly learn that the secret to success is to swap between the two frequently, essentially operating as two distinct units at the same time.\n\nRelated to this are the AI bots which round out the matches. With only 12 players per match, it's tempting to see this as a way of making up the numbers, but these drone fighters prove to be more than that. They're a third tier of combatant, mostly dim, unlikely to do any real damage and unable to swing the direction of a match, but they act as battlefield markers that skilled pilots can quickly read. Follow the drones and you'll find the heat of the action. That they also offer small scoring opportunities and reasonably useful back-up is just gravy. Crucially, they offer easy cannon fodder for new players, breaking that dispiriting cycle of respawn-death-respawn that comes from player-only deathmatches. Every player can feel like they're doing something useful, something fun, even if they're actually getting creamed.\n\nIt's a sharp change of direction for developers who previously skewed the genre by introducing Modern Warfare's controversial Perk and Killstreak systems - and the equivalent here marks the difference neatly. Burn Cards aren't earned for just killing other players, but handed out generously for meeting all sorts of criteria in almost 1000 ongoing ambient stats challenges. You can equip up to three cards per match, and opt to use one before a round starts. You may get a more powerful weapon, a souped-up ability or a reduction in the countdown for your Titan. What matters is that each card is a single-use item and is lost at the end of the match or when you die, whichever comes first. In other words, they offer a useful advantage, but only for a short time. The days of the best players getting permanent boosts that keep them at the top are gone.\n\nPlaying the live game After a week of playing Titanfall on populated retail servers, we can report that the game hasn't suffered any grievous problems or technical setbacks. That is, of course, excepting the hiccups that affected both Xbox Live and Origin at the game's US launch. While it's unfair to hold such admittedly brief outages against Respawn's game, they do illustrate the potential pitfalls of a game that relies so heavily on an internet connection. Since Titanfall uses cloud computing to run some of its game code, rather than just to connect players, if these gateway services go down then the whole game becomes locked off. As such, there's seemingly no way for the game to offer local offline play in the future and even the tutorial is unavailable if servers are unresponsive. That's not something we can quantify or predict in terms of Titanfall's score, but it's certainly something that bears consideration. At some point in the future, the cloud servers could be taken down or reassigned elsewhere and Titanfall will cease to be playable. That somewhat troubling horizon aside, Titanfall's online play is, based on a traffic-heavy first week, fine. The game still suffers from chunky frame rates when Titans battle up close, and you'll still get those rare moments of infuriating lag where the replay shows an enemy killing you with a shot that seemingly passed through the scenery to get you, but server hiccups are rare. Only twice in over 10 hours of play has the message \"Reconnecting to server\" appeared. At these points the entire screen blurs, even as the match continues, but the issue never took more than a few seconds to resolve. Even with the cloud doing support work for the Xbox One's processor, Titanfall plays as well as a steady and reliable last-gen title. Not really noticeable progress from a player's perspective, then, but a relatively painless launch and a game that hasn't suffered any of the grim problems that Battlefield and SimCity players faced last year.\n\nTitanfall's action is as muscular and thrilling as you'd expect, given Respawn's pedigree, but it's this new attitude towards player balance that makes it stand out. Skill is still rewarded, but lack of skill isn't so harshly punished. Witness the adrenalin rush of ejecting from a doomed Titan and soaring into the air for a bird's eye view of the battlefield that allows you to drop back into action with a tactical advantage. Better still is the idea of evacuation, a stroke of match design genius that ends every round not with a hard cut to the leaderboard but with an extra-time, no-respawns scramble to an exit point.\n\nThose on the losing team have to reach a dropship before it escapes; the winners must stop them. It's a small and simple tweak, but one that offers just enough of a second chance, and a team-based narrative, to take the personal sting out of defeat. Many's the time you'll lose a match but emerge feeling victorious because you made it to the dropship unscathed. It's this willingness to make even losing fun that sets Titanfall apart, and suggests a more inclusive future for the FPS genre.\n\nYou need to complete both the IMC and Militia campaigns in order to unlock all three Titan chassis for custom loadouts.\n\nNot all of the concessions to more inviting play are as well considered, however. The auto-targetting Smart Pistol is another fine example of how an apparently game-breaking idea can actually enhance the experience. It's powerful, but never too powerful, and as you unlock more weapons you'll naturally gravitate away from it. It's just a shame that the weapons that follow are never as interesting or imaginative. Assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns and sniper rifles - there are few surprises, and even the anti-Titan weapons are sensibly effective rather than memorable and exciting. It's all disappointingly vanilla-flavoured after the Smart Pistol, which stands alone in the arsenal as a weapon with unique gameplay intent behind it. It's as if the team behind Insomniac's inventively armed Resistance series popped in, designed one weapon, then left.\n\nWeaponry is one area where it feels like Respawn wasn't quite ready to let go of its Infinity Ward heritage; the other is the game modes themselves. Despite gameplay systems that shake up FPS tropes in enjoyable new ways, the fact that you're limited to five overly familiar play styles can't help but eat away at Titanfall's long-term appeal. Hardpoint Domination and Attrition are the main two, the only ones used in the so-called campaign matches, and they're predictable enough. Attrition is Team Deathmatch by any other name, while Hardpoint Domination is a base capture mode with three holding points per map. The latter shows Titanfall at its strongest, demanding solid offensive and defensive play across the whole of the map.\n\nThere's also Pilot Hunter, in which points are only scored by killing pilots not demolishing Titans, and the flipside to that is Last Titan Standing, in which every player starts in a Titan but there are no respawns. As the name suggests, the first team to run out of Titans loses. Neither mode is particularly satisfying, though Last Titan Standing has a certain pugnacious charm as it often descends into short, brutal slugfests. The trouble is that Titanfall's appeal comes from the way its ideas are intertwined, so modes that force players to focus on one aspect over another are inevitably weakened. That only leaves Capture The Flag, a standard inclusion that isn't elevated enough by Titanfall's best ideas. CTF matches too often end in stalemate, and while the maps offer some interesting routes for parkour escapes, it's the least satisfying way to play.\n\nWhile these rather tired old modes are initially refreshed by Titanfall's reconstructed approach to FPS pacing and balance, it's not quite enough to sustain it. There's a plateau somewhere around level 25 where the rate of unlocks slows down, the matches start to fall into repetition, and the accumulation of XP, generous as it is, begins to feel the drag of the grind. What's missing is a mode that could only be done in this game - something that redefines the shooter on Titanfall's terms.\n\nMap design is solid, if short on memorable features. Mostly, it's the same balancing act that impresses: the way that a map takes on completely different aspects from a Titan cockpit than it does from the ground. It's a different style of map-making from that practised on the Modern Warfare series, where constant, restless and relentless motion is the driving force. Titanfall maps have more corners and dead ends, more strange angles, than the frictionless ice rinks of COD.\n\nOne of the most useful Burn Cards disguises you as an AI grunt - it's amazing how many players will ignore you.\n\nThe naming conventions, at least, hark back to Respawn's past with curt, even blunt, one-word titles such as Lagoon, Fracture and Corporate the norm. The latter is one of the best examples of how the game juggles tense, intimate, interior conflicts with larger-scale, Titan-fuelled bombast. Set in a robotics factory, the map has wide, sweeping exteriors, an enclosed courtyard, tangles of interior rooms offering multiple vantage points and - crucially - lots of rooftops and elevated walkways. The flow is different to COD's as you segue between slower-paced, pounding Titan encounters and fast and nasty quick-draw scenarios, before taking to the higher ground to survey the situation and maybe pull off some long-distance kills.\n\nNavigating these spaces is a constant pleasure, as you piggyback on enemy Titans and spring off again as they explode, using them as stepping stones to otherwise unreachable spots. It's not just that the game lets you do this sort of thing, but that it feels so effortless in execution. It's like playing first-person Crackdown - a game where you almost can't help but do cool stuff.\n\n\"Respawn has shaken up the FPS just as surely as Infinity Ward did with Modern Warfare, and any one of Titanfall's ideas would be a fine starting point for a new era in shooter design.\"\n\nIs Titanfall the next-gen showcase we've been waiting for? In pure gameplay terms, it's hard to argue otherwise. Respawn has shaken up the FPS just as surely as Infinity Ward did with the original Modern Warfare, and any one of Titanfall's ideas would be a fine starting point for a new era in shooter design. That it boasts several such ideas speaks highly of the studio's desire to break the repetition that has taken root in recent years.\n\nStructurally is where Titanfall shows its limitations, and the reliance on the same old standard match types feels like a concession to the restrictions the rest of the game kicks against. Technically, too, it's not quite the polished gem some may be expecting. Textures don't always impress when wall-running brings you close to them, and the frame rate can still chug when the action gets intense. There's noticeable screen tearing and load times can be a chore. Character models and animations don't always stand up to much scrutiny either. None of this is particularly harmful, but it does take the shine off what many will expect to be a pristine, console-justifying experience.\n\nIt all comes back to the gameplay though, and it's here that Titanfall stamps its identity most firmly. It's no secret that first-person shooters are in a comfortable rut, and Titanfall shakes things up perfectly - not just in terms of design, but more crucially, in how these games relate to their audience. With almost no blood and only mild swearing, the game's accessible nature is a door thrown open to everyone who has steered clear of the bullish, hyper-macho military shooters that have come to dominate the scene.\n\nIn fact, Titanfall gets so much right that it's easy to start taking it for granted, as game-changing ideas become second nature so quickly and so easily. Titanfall's moment-to-moment gameplay is fantastic, but it's the things that are missing that hold it back from being truly excellent. The technical rough edges are disappointing, but not distractingly so. Harder to ignore are the limited and repetitive game modes and a general lack of options for refining the matchmaking.\n\nThere are no private lobbies, nor any opportunity to vote on the next map or mode. Getting into a game is slick and easy, but the downside is that you end up taking what you're given. Matchmaking, too, needs work: lobbies tend to go out of balance during prolonged sessions as players drop out and teams are repopulated in odd ways. It's not unusual to see one team with multiple high-level players pitted against a team whose highest ranked player is in the mid-teens. The good news is that Respawn is aware of, and reacting to, these issues. With the right updates and additions, Titanfall could easily become the shooter of choice for the new console generation. For now, it's muscular and entertaining, but limited in scope.\n\nIn its current form, then, Titanfall is perhaps more of a step forward for shooters than a giant leap. But that still represents the most positive momentum seen in the genre for at least five years. Quite simply, if you feel like you're in danger of falling out of love with multiplayer shooters, Titanfall is the game to win you back.\n\nThis review was originally published as a launch review on 10th March, meaning we played the game in controlled conditions and withheld a score until we could test it on live servers.

The shooter adventure for Xbox will usually cost $60 but will be available for free with the purchase of a console for $499, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nRetailers at around 6,000 locations will launch the game with special events at midnight; Microsoft hopes the title will boost sales for the Xbox One, which has fallen behind Sony's new PlayStation 4.\n\n\"'Titanfall' is an incredibly important game and it's coming at an important time,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, as quoted by WSJ.\n\nTitanfall, which Microsoft has been marketing since last June, has a first-person perspective and takes users through an urban battlefield. Players in the game direct \"Titans,\" which are machines similar to robots that can be programmed to fight.\n\nDesigned to be played with other users through the Internet, Titanfall has single- and multiple-player options. The title has had social media buzz on par with \"Call of Duty\" and has been the most pre-ordered video game in the country in the last month, according to the WSJ report.\n\nPerhaps Titanfall can bring up the Xbox One's lagging sales numbers. The console has fallen fairly far behind its main competitor, the PlayStation 4. In mid-February, Sony said its new console had sold twice as many as the Xbox One.\n\nPlaystation announced at the time that the device was \"the #1 selling game console in the US in January, still #1 worldwide,\" GameSpot reported.\n\nTitanfall could become the new system-selling game, similar to the way \"Super Mario Bros.\" defined Nintendo and \"Halo\" brought users to the original Xbox, WSJ reported.\n\n\"It has the potential,\" said Greg Blair, 31, of Appleton, Wis., who has played a beta version of the game.\n\n\"It's a start,\" he told WSJ.", "61": "The Xbox One version of Titanfall will launch at 792p, the same resolution as the beta. According to Eurogamer, Respawn Entertainment has been trying to optimize the game to run at higher resolutions on the Xbox One, but haven\u2019t been happy with the outcome.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re likely to increase resolution after we ship\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,\u201d says Respawn Engineer Richard Baker. \u201cWe\u2019re going to experiment.

Since the November launch, a number of games have failed to hit the illusive 1080p target that many gamers have hoped for. Comments from Respawn Entertainment earlier this year suggested that the game would launch at a higher resolution than the beta, but that obviosuly isn\u2019t going to be the launch day experience.\n\nSHARE THIS", "62": "Arguable the most anticipated game so far this year, Titanfall is a mere hours away for some. With a digital version available for every platform the game is going to exist on at launch, there\u2019s a good chance you could be stuck waiting for your game to download instead of playing when the servers go live. Unless of course, you preload your game.\n\nIf you\u2019re not planning to wait in line at your local game store at midnight to pick up the small person-sized Collector\u2019s Edition box for PC, digital folks will be seated comfortably at home when Titanfall launches for the US. Whether you\u2019ve purchased the game directly from the Origin store or are waiting for it to become available for purchase on Xbox Live, we\u2019re only a few hours away from the launch.\n\nPC owners will have the ability to preload Titanfall, meaning if you purchase the game now you can have everything ready to go the second it goes live in your timezone. According to Respawn, the launch of Titanfall will be staggered like this:\n\nUnited States: 3/11/14 \u2013 12:00 AM PDT\n\nCanada: 3/11/14 \u2013 12:00 AM PDT\n\nMexico: 3/11/14 \u2013 12:00 AM PST\n\nBrazil: 3/11/14 \u2013 4:00 AM BRT\n\nAustria: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM CET\n\nFrance: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM CET\n\nGermany: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM CET\n\nIreland: 3/14/14 \u2013 12:00 AM GMT\n\nItaly: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM CET\n\nSpain: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM CET\n\nUnited Kingdom: 3/14/14 \u2013 12:00 AM GMT\n\nAustralia: 3/13/14 \u2013 12:00 AM AEDT\n\nNew Zealand: 3/14/14 \u2013 12:00 AM NZDT\n\nPreloading the game is easy. If you\u2019ve already purchased Titanfall for your PC, you\u2019ll see a preload option available to you in the Origin app on your computer. If you haven\u2019t made the purchase yet, you\u2019ll see the preload option appear as soon as the transaction is complete and Titanfall has been added to your Library. If you pre-ordered the game at a retail outlet, you\u2019ll be provided with a code that will add the game to your Library, which means you can\u2019t preload without that code.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to purchase the game digitally on the Xbox One, you\u2019ll need to wait until it is available on Xbox Live to do so. The game will then need to download and install, and neither Microsoft nor Respawn has announced a preload function for the console version yet.\n\nThere will be no \u201cDay One\u201d update for Titanfall on the Xbox One to address the resolution of the game, which was suggested when the Beta rolled out last month. Just like the Beta, Titanfall on the Xbox One will run at 792p. There may be an update later on that addresses this (and gets it nearer to 900p), but at launch the game will likely look almost exactly like the Beta.", "63": "Titanfall launches at the same \"792p\" resolution as the beta code released last month, according to reports that surfaced over the weekend, and officially confirmed by Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker during a recent interview with Digital Foundry.\n\nWe asked Baker whether we can expect to see any post-beta resolution shifts, bearing in mind comments attributed to Respawn community manager Abbie Heppe, who indicated that final resolution may be in the region of 900p.\n\n\"We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target,\" Baker told us.\n\n\"We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res.

We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.\"\n\nWhat's curious about this response is that ESRAM utilisation appears to be key for Respawn as opposed to raw GPU power, as the jump from 792p to 900p, and again to 1080p are highly significant resolution bumps unlikely to be resolved by switching away from multi-sampling anti-aliasing (MSAA) alone. However, theoretically, dropping MSAA from a 1408x792 framebuffer could free up enough ESRAM to accommodate a 1080p image. In our recent tech analysis of the beta, we were curious about how Respawn could increase resolution so dramatically when the 792p code we played had issues sustaining a locked 60fps.\n\nPreliminary performance analysis from the Xbox One version of Titanfall, captured here in its beta incarnation. Respawn tells us to expect average performance in line with the code you may have already played, but with the worst-case scenarios improved.\n\n\"A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it,\" Baker commented. \"Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.\"\n\nBaker did reveal that we can expect to see some performance increases in the shipping game, based on optimisations carried out after the beta concluded.\n\n\"There was an issue with decals taking a lot more time than they should which we fixed for launch,\" he said. \"The worst-case scenarios are better, I think. The average is probably about the same as the beta.\"", "64": "First noticed on Saturday, visitors to the Mt. Gox website were greeted with a spam warning letter . The warning cautions everyone about spam emails looking like they are from Mt. Gox in an attempt at phishing. Mt. Gox indicates that they never request personal information by email, and is advising everyone not to respond to any type of email asking for their personal information.Following that, late on Sunday, troubled Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., which follows a previous filing in Japan in February for bankruptcy protection. The filing is under Chapter 15, which is defined as, \u201cChapter 15 is a new chapter added to the Bankruptcy Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. It is the U.S. domestic adoption of the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency promulgated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\") in 1997, and it replaces section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code. Because of the UNCITRAL source for chapter 15, the U.S. interpretation must be coordinated with the interpretation given by other countries that have adopted it as internal law to promote a uniform and coordinated legal regime for cross-border insolvency cases.\u201d This filing covers all of the interests involved in more than one country.In the court documents filed in Federal Court in Dallas, dated March 10, 2014, CEO Mark Karpeles noted that company has approximately $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets at present. He also states that Mt. Gox has no secured debt and that approximately 12 percent of the equity in Mt. Gox is held by the developer of the initial Mt. Gox software, Jed MacCaleb, with the remaining equity held by Tibbanne Co. Ltd, aka Tibanne KK, a Japanese corporation located in Japan. Karpeles also stated that the business challenges they faced were substantial denial of service attacks which forced them to shut down several times, and which ultimately led to the theft of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins owned by Mt. Gox customers and Mt. Gox itself. Those circumstances resulted in a total halt of all withdrawals on February 7, 2014.Karpeles declaration asks for the court\u2019s assistance to \u201callow MtGox the breathing room necessary to address technical defects in its processing software, investigate the theft of bitcoins through its exchange, and confirm a rehabilitation plan.\u201dWhile the future of Mt. Gox remains very questionable, the Bitcoin community as a whole is moving on unfazed by all the recent headlines. The losses at Mt. Gox, Flexcoin and elsewhere didn't seem to change prices as much as one would have expected, they've remained in a somewhat steady range between $500 and $700. Many critics, however, still remain skeptical as to what the future holds for the cryptocurrency because bitcoin isn't tied to any regulatory bank or government policies, which makes it more susceptible to fraud and abuse, and is an excellent way for criminals to launder their money.", "65": "Mt Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, has received US bankruptcy protection to temporarily halt US legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.\n\nJudge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt Gox's US-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt Gox's assets. Mt Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n\"This case involves a massive fraud,\" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. \"They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.\"\n\nMt Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab, which sued Mt Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behaviour by Karpeles in the days leading up the US bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr Karpeles,\" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt Gox to ask the US Bankruptcy Court to recognise its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its US-based assets.\n\nHale's order protects Mt Gox's US assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt Gox will seek a permanent stay of US litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all US residents who paid a trading fee to Mt Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of US$75 million from Mt Gox.\n\nMt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue US law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress.

Gox bitcoin exchange is spilling into U.S. bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $473 million.\n\nMt. Gox's bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange's abrupt closure. The U.S. case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to reorganize their finances.\n\nMt. Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin skeptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.\n\nOnce the world's largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, Mt. Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt. Gox CEO Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.\n\nThe missing currency, valued at $473 million at the time of Mt. Gox's Feb. 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about 7 per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.\n\nAlthough it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a U.S. bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's demise.\n\nThe civil complaint brought against Mt. Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all U.S. residents who had paid fees to Mt. Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.\n\nSteven Woodrow, a Denver attorney representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case. In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt. Gox's computers and other assets in the U.S. A hearing on Woodrow's request for the court order is scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago.\n\nIf the Illinois case proceeds, Mt. Gox attorneys contend that it will drain the company's finances and divert management's attention during a critical time.\n\nMt. Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.\n\nMt. Gox also is hoping to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former U.S. partner, CoinLab Action.\n\nUnder an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt. Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the U.S. and Canada. The alliance unraveled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt. Gox for alleged breach of contract.

Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nMt.Gox a 'fox guarding henhouse'\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n\"This case involves a massive fraud,\" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. \"They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.\"\n\nMt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,\" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nBankruptcy protects U.S. assets\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.\n\nHale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.\n\nShell company run by French-Canadian\n\nMt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.\n\nThe agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves.

Gox, the former major Bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as part of a bid to protect itself from legal action in this country. The exchange had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan back in February, but had avoided doing so in the United States. This latest move was almost certainly precipitated by Sunday\u2019s announcement that hackers had breached Mt. Gox\u2019s records and were publishing data dumps \u201cproving\u201d that Mt. Gox still possessed roughly 950,000 Bitcoins \u2014 far more than the 850,000 the company claims to have lost.\n\nConsidering that 850,000 BTC is still worth roughly $530 million at today\u2019s exchange rates, it\u2019s easy to see why so many people are incensed at the actions of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of its CEO, Mark Karpeles. Reports on Mt. Gox\u2019s troubles over the past few months paint Karpeles as distracted, poorly organized, and ultimately more interested in launching a Bitcoin cafe in the same building as the exchange rather than working to solve the security problems of the site itself.\n\nThe hackers released screenshots and other data that purport to show Mt. Gox moving hundreds of BTC to customer wallets even after \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d issues had supposedly prevented Mt. Gox from making any transactions at all. Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US allows the company to protect its US assets and recognize its declaration of bankruptcy in US Courts. It can be contested by US creditors.\n\nUnfortunately for Karpeles, filing for legal protection in the United States immediately after hackers claim to have discovered allegations of criminal misconduct will almost certainly fan the flames of the investors and BTC owners already calling for his head. Bankruptcy protection is not an absolute shield \u2014 it can protect a company from being chopped up and liquidated by creditors (at least, for a little while) \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t shield a company from criminal charges or theft of property.\n\nOne word of caution, however, before accepting the word of the hacking crew as gospel: others have noted that attempts to read Mt. Gox\u2019s activities through the block chain are exceptionally difficult, partly because the software that performs deep block chain analysis is still in its infancy. Similarly, pouring through hundreds of megabytes of records doesn\u2019t automatically link those logged transactions with the block chain history.\n\nEven if data released by the hack is legitimate, it will take a great deal of time to establish its authenticity and confirm that Mt. Gox is or isn\u2019t criminally absconding with other people\u2019s money. If the company has engaged in criminal fraud, than filing bankruptcy won\u2019t save it. If it hasn\u2019t, then the leaks may end up shedding light on how the attacks against Mt. Gox were carried out \u2014 which could, in turn, lead to criminal negligence charges depending on the nature of the security breaches.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Mark Karpeles had neither the intelligence nor the discipline to lead a major Bitcoin exchange, but teasing out the details of the attacks and establishing Mt. Gox\u2019s culpability is going to take time. Meanwhile, the overarching situation around BTC continues to take its own bizarre turns. On Friday, BTC blogger Ryan Selkis promised to unleash information that would destroy the legitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation by elaborating on various unspecified \u201cdamning facts.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Selkis declared that he had made a tactical error and would not be publishing said facts, leaving the community with plenty of questions and a great deal of mud to fling \u2014 but not much more. Then there\u2019s last week\u2019s battle over the identity of Sakoshi Nakamoto who may (or may not) be a 64-year-old man living in the Los Angeles foothills. In every instance, who you believe depends far more on faith than on hard fact. Speculation on the motivations and identities of the players runs just as rampant as speculation on cryptocurrencies themselves.", "70": "The latest news on Bitcoin: Mt.

But the hackers claimed, \"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed.\" Next to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins, the hackers noted, \"That fat [bleep] has been lying!\"\n\nThe hackers wrote, \"We stole no bitcoins.

Gox's parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers' access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles' home addresses and Karpeles' personal CV.\n\nForbes was unable to verify the info, but the many commenters over the web say it is the real deal. Then again, that could be social engineering so people with bitcoins will download the file, click on the tainted .exe, and lose their bitcoins to the hackers.

Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.", "76": "The guy who is going to get the masses to embrace a TV series about science, the one to get viewers to go where no man has convinced them to go before \u2013 or at least since Carl Sagan \u2013 is \u2026 Seth MacFarlane?\n\nThe comic mind behind \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and the hit film \u201cTed\u201d contains a serious side, too, as MacFarlane is the executive producer and driving force behind \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d \u2013 Fox\u2019s reboot of Sagan\u2019s 1980 miniseries masterpiece, \u201cCosmos: A Personal Journey\u201d \u2013 that launched Sunday night.\n\nMacFarlane has not tackled the challenge alone. Chief among his \u201cCosmos\u201d compatriots are Ann Druyan, Sagan\u2019s widow and a co-writer of the original series, and host Neil deGrasse Tyson, the unofficial face of astrophysics to most Americans.\n\nSagan\u2019s \u201cCosmos\u201d achieved a popularity unheard of for a science program. It became PBS\u2019s most-watched series ever, and held that title until it was usurped in 1990 by \u201cThe Civil War.\u201d\n\nAlthough the paths they take are slightly different, both versions of \u201cCosmos\u201d bear an ambitious plot: The story of everything. The series is intended to be a necessarily brief biography of existence, as well as how our understanding of the known universe has evolved. The production uses special effects and animation to give the new \u201cCosmos\u201d a visual impact the original could not achieve, and Tyson\u2019s approachable style helps make a complex topic as friendly as possible.\n\nStill, the 13-part miniseries is a gamble for Fox. Science programming is extremely rare in prime time on a major network. But for MacFarlane, putting the show outside of a specialty channel was part of the appeal.\n\n\u201cWhile National Geographic, Discovery Channel were some of the places that it was being considered to be pitched to and are great networks, in a way, you\u2019re sort of preaching to the converted,\u201d MacFarlane told a gathering of TV critics recently. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to broaden it a little bit even more? And I thought that there was a strong possibility that this particular regime at Fox, as creative and open-minded as they are, would be receptive to the idea of doing the show on a network, and sure enough, they were.\u201d\n\nAnd he thinks scheduling it after Fox\u2019s block of animated comedies on Sunday nights makes sense, as it will draw viewers, well, like him.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a lot of people who are fans of both genres and are very enthusiastic,\u201d MacFarlane said.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell what Sunday\u2019s premiere means for \u201cCosmos.\u201d The early numbers on Fox were unimpressive \u2013 5.8 million viewers \u2013 but it totaled nearly 9 million when all 10 networks showing it were added in. With DVR numbers and online viewing yet to be counted, \u201cCosmos\u201d still could work its way up.\n\nFor many years, science television, at least for grown-ups, has largely belonged to PBS and imports from the BBC \u2013 which often are one and the same.\n\n\u201cNova\u201d is a spinoff of the British series \u201cHorizon,\u201d and often its episodes are from that show or other documentaries from the United Kingdom, with the narration redubbed by an American speaker.\n\nThe BBC has produced some of the most acclaimed science miniseries of the past: \u201cThe Blue Planet,\u201d \u201cPlanet Earth,\u201d \u201cLife,\u201d \u201cThe Ascent of Man,\u201d many of which came to the United States via PBS.\n\nAnd science remains a big part of PBS\u2019s lineup. Wednesdays were rebranded \u201cThink Wednesday\u201d this year, as the network added a weekly hour of science specials to its astoundingly long-lived lineup of \u201cNature\u201d and \u201cNova.\u201d (\u201cNova\u201d debuted 40 years ago this month, on March 3, 1974.)\n\nThe shows continue to be two of PBS\u2019s better ratings draws. An episode of \u201cNova\u201d about the John F. Kennedy assassination last fall pulled in nearly 6 million viewers, the biggest audience in nearly two years, according to Paula Apsell, the show\u2019s senior executive producer. Apsell called the 2013 fall season \u201cvery successful.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the programming guide, science fares less well. In the last few years, channels that served up a high portion of science have seen their schedules metamorphose into something considerably less scientific. The problem is easy to understand. For many people, \u201cscience\u201d conjures memories of struggling to calculate molarities in high-school chemistry class. Getting them to think of science as a topic tospend their TV time on is difficult.\n\nThe phenomenon mirrors what happened with channels that began in the 1990s with an eye toward arts and education. Bravo, the Arts & Entertainment Network (now A&E) and The Learning Channel (now TLC) currently serve up such highbrow fare as \u201cThe Real Housewives of Orange County\u201d and \u201cHere Comes Honey Boo-Boo.\u201d\n\nDiscovery, originally intended for mostly science programming, spun the bulk of its science content to a sister network, the Science Channel, to concentrate on reality series like \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d and \u201cMoonshiners.\u201d Sure, it still offers shows like \u201cMythBusters,\u201d but that has been on since 2003. Newer programs aremore likely to look like \u201cAmish Mafia.\u201d\n\nThe Science Channel itself does some excellent work, such as \u201cThrough the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman.\u201d Increasingly, though, its programming slate is filled with the likes of \u201cUncovering Aliens\u201d and \u201cNASA\u2019s Unexplained Files\u201d that pander to pseudoscience fans and conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe National Geographic Channel, the Fox sibling that is co-broadcasting \u201cCosmos,\u201d has seen its schedule fill up with \u201cDoomsday Preppers\u201d and \u201cWicked Tuna.\u201d\n\nEven legitimate science programs seem to feel the need to overemphasize death and disaster to draw viewers. For instance, History Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Universe,\u201d which began life as a well-reasoned documentary series, has spent the last five seasons detailing the various ways the Earth might be destroyed.\n\nBut perhaps nothing exemplifies the issue better than Animal Planet, which came under fire from scientists for its 2012 \u201cdocumentary\u201d \u201cMermaids: The Body Found,\u201d actually a bad science-fiction film disguised as a documentary. The special was wildly popular, and last year\u2019s inevitable sequel, \u201cMermaids: The New Evidence,\u201d became Animal Planet\u2019s highest-rated program to date.\n\nPerhaps all is not lost, though. National Geographic\u2019s excellent series \u201cBrain Games,\u201d a fun investigation into the vagaries of perception and the conscious mind, was popular enough to prompt the network to add similar programs, such as \u201cDuck Quacks Don\u2019t Echo.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d succeeds, perhaps an explosion of science programming will follow. If not, there\u2019s always PBS.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @Watcherof TV on Twitter", "77": "Apparently there is an audience for science in primetime, as Fox\u2019s 10-network roadblock premiere of \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d attracted a sizable 8.5 million viewers on Sunday night \u2014 despite facing tough competition from entertainment series like AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and ABC\u2019s new \u201cResurrection.\u201d\n\nThe Fox network broadcast averaged about 5.8 million viewers in Nielsen\u2019s affiliate-based estimates for the 9 o\u2019clock hour Sunday, as well as a 2.1 rating/5 share in adults 18-49. The under-50 audience was comprised of roughly 60% men.\n\nViewing on other networks raised these totals to 8.5 million and a 2.9 rating in the demo, according to Nielsen.\n\nIn addition to the broadcaster, the premiere of \u201cCosmos\u201d aired across nine Fox networks: National Geographic Channel, FX, FXX, FXM, FOX Sports 1, FOX Sports 2, Nat Geo Wild, Nat Geo Mundo and FOX Life.\n\nFox projects that the global total-viewer number for the \u201cCosmos\u201d premiere will top 40 million.\n\n\u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d is a follow-up to the 1980s series \u201cCosmos: A Personal Voyage\u201d with Carl Sagan.\n\nThe eight-week series is hosted this time around by astrophysicist and science enthusiast Neil deGrasse Tyson. The series is executive produced by Seth MacFarlane and Ann Druyan, the widow of Sagan.", "78": "Early on during Fox\u2019s new version of Cosmos, host Neil deGrasse Tyson shares what is likely a guiding principle for his life and work, but certainly a fundamental premise of this new show: \u201cScience gives us the power to see what our senses cannot.\u201d\n\nWhat our senses can\u2019t see without science \u2014 and some extremely impressive animation and effects work by the show\u2019s producers \u2014 is the universe around us. Tyson and his \u201cShip of the Imagination\u201d (a sleek update of Carl Sagan\u2019s original concept that would fit comfortably in any current sci-fi film) takes us on a guided tour of the solar system, of the galaxy, pushing the view further and further out until we reach the limit of our knowledge and perception. There\u2019s only so much we know. There may be only so much we ever know.\n\nFor many, that could be a stopping point. How interested can we be, or should we be, in something so abstract, something we can\u2019t see or perhaps even comprehend? In Tyson\u2019s view, however, that uncertainty should be what fuels our desire to learn more. It\u2019s there \u2014 we just haven\u2019t seen it yet. And that should excite us. Why wouldn\u2019t it excite us? How could you not want to learn more about this? Come on and join him on his magic spaceship ride!\n\nAbove all, the intent of Cosmos seems to be getting you to look up from your laptop, put down your phone, stop playing games and chatting, realize what the hell is going on around you (in a cosmic sense) and appreciate just how amazing everything is. A byproduct of that is telling us to get over ourselves. We are but a tiny speck of dust on the table that is the universe. Existence as we know it \u2014 or what we know of it \u2014 is so very small in the big, infinite picture.\n\nBut Tyson and Cosmos try to make that concept accessible by framing it in terms we can understand. In perhaps the best segment of the first episode, Tyson lays out the existence of the universe as if it were a 12-month calendar. The Big Bang, of course, would be Jan. 1 on this calendar, while humanity would be Dec. 31 \u2014 not just the last day, but the very last seconds of this cosmic year. If this calendar was on your desk, we would be the extremely tiny tip of the lower-left corner.\n\nThis is one of several moments in Cosmos\u2019 first episode meant to make you go, \u201cWhoa\u2026!\u201d And you can sense Tyson in front of you, smiling and saying, I know \u2014 right?\u201d The astrophysicist is the perfect host for the show, having been an ambassador and champion of science in the culture for years. He\u2019s obviously comfortable talking to fellow academics, but also makes a great guest on shows like The Daily Show, The Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher because he\u2019s intelligent, funny and entertainingly intolerant of those who willfully ignore the facts that science presents.\n\nMost importantly, Tyson is engaging enough that you want to listen to him. (So many already have, from Tyson\u2019s days of hosting Nova on PBS to his StarTalk podcast.) The man is a really good talker and an enthusiastic teacher. And he\u2019s great on Twitter.\n\n(Two years ago, Tyson was even a character in a Superman comic, showing the Man of Steel his home world of Krypton. Because who else would you want to consult with Superman about his home planet and how he traveled to Earth than Neil deGrasse Tyson?)\n\nBut there\u2019s also something personal in this for Tyson, as he shares toward the end of the first episode. Sagan was a hero of his, a mentor. As a 17-year-old from the Bronx, Tyson traveled to Cornell to visit Sagan and spend the day with him. Sagan welcomed him with open arms, signed his books, offered him lodging and inspired the young man to follow his interests and curiosities. Hosting Cosmos is a legacy for Tyson, one he\u2019s clearly honored to fulfill as tribute to a man who meant so much to him.\n\nThe show looks fantastic. As mentioned earlier, the cosmic landscapes created by animation and visual effects are as impressive as anything you\u2019d see in a Hollywood blockbuster. This show isn\u2019t restricted by the public television budget that Sagan\u2019s original PBS incarnation of Cosmos had to work with. (And, of course, computer-generated imagery has come a long, long way in more than 30 years.) The producers have invested some serious money into this project and it\u2019s impressively apparent on screen.\n\nOne of my first thoughts as I was watching the show was that my TV isn\u2019t nearly big enough. I was watching on the smaller screen in my bedroom. This is one you\u2019ll want to watch on the big screen in your living room. The show seems to be why HD televisions were invented. Retailers like Best Buy will want to play episodes of Cosmos on the sales floor to show customers what their televisions are capable of showing. It\u2019s not just hockey and golf that looks great on those sets, folks.\n\nWatching Cosmos on the big screen in your living room raises another thought. If this is meant to be Sunday night family-friendly programming \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to imagine parents watching this with their children, with everyone in awe and learning \u2014 why isn\u2019t Fox showing this at 7 p.m., instead of 9 p.m. when many kids are presumably going to bed? (Even worse is the Monday night replay on National Geographic Channel, which broadcasts at 10 p.m.) Or did the kids already get their fill of programming with Fox\u2019s animation block?\n\nSpeaking of that animation block, one of the biggest surprises behind the scenes of Cosmos, if you didn\u2019t already know, is that Family Guy impresario Seth McFarlane is a key figure responsible for the show\u2019s revival. \u201cCosmos Being Brought Back by Seth McFarlane\u201d seems more like an Onion headline than actual news.\n\nThe guy who\u2019s created some of TV\u2019s raunchiest (and funniest) prime-time content is shepherding Carl Sagan\u2019s original science vehicle? Yet we should all be grateful that McFarlane has enough influence and clout with Fox to get this series made. It surely wasn\u2019t an easy sell for prime-time programming. Any worries that Peter Griffin will tell us about Uranus are unfounded. Besides, would Tyson really let that happen? He\u2019s more concerned with battling the war on science, as CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter calls it, or what President Obama termed \u201cthe flat earth society.\u201d Educating the masses, fighting for science\u2019s place in the culture and respecting our role in the universe is far more important work.\n\nIf you missed Cosmos Sunday night, try to catch that replay on NatGeo or check it out on Hulu. The stuff with the spaceship might seem a bit cheesy, but it\u2019s all fun. (That is, unless you feel the show might be challenging your religious or anti-science beliefs. It\u2019s not for everyone, nor is it intended to be.) Cosmos will make you feel like a kid again. Or maybe take you back to those dorm-room discussions (perhaps drug- or alcohol-fueled, perhaps not) when you contemplated existence, the origins of trees and the vastness of outer space. It restores a sense of wonder, which is what great television should do.", "79": "For the fans of Carl Sagan\u2019s Cosmos series, you might just be pleasantly surprised that the series is back with a \u2018big bang\u2019, not to mention updates on all of the new discoveries in the universe.\n\nAs if the debut on Sunday night wasn\u2019t exciting enough, there was a pretty special surprise guest: President Barack Obama, who introduced the episode with a special message that urged viewers to explore new frontiers, like space!\n\nAll politics aside, it was awe inspiring to have Obama as the opening act of such a spectacular event. The president\u2019s introduction \u201cinvites a new generation to embrace the spirit of discovery and inspires viewers to explore new frontiers and imagine limitless possibilities for the future,\u201d according to a statement issued by Fox.\n\nThe new Fox science series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey premiered on Sunday March 9th, and begins a 13-part journey through the universe and beyond, airing on 10 networks, led by Fox and National Geographic Channel.\n\nWith the brilliant scientist, astrophysicist and educator, Neil deGrasse Tyson hosting the series, it should be full of surprises.\n\nI want to fall to my knees and weep tears of joy for how beautiful and mind blowing #Cosmos is done.

Most important, it celebrates scientific inquiry itself, which Tyson defines as \u2018generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules: test ideas by experiment and observation; build on those ideas that pass the test; reject the ones that fail; follow the evidence wherever it leads; and question everything.\u201d\n\nThe series is presented to generate interest in science and the universe, with an interesting and fun introduction.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet. It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe,\u201d says Tyson. \u201cScience should be part of everybody\u2019s life. The prerequisite is not that you become a scientist. It\u2019s that at the end of the series, you will embrace science and recognize its role in who and what you are.\u201d\n\nThe Fox and National Geographic preview hosted at the White House on Feb 28, signaled the start of the White House Student Film Festival, and tied in with Obama\u2019s efforts to boost the use of technology and science in classrooms around the country.\n\nCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will air Sundays at 9 pm on Fox and Mondays at 10 pm on the National Geographic Channel with bonus footage and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nAmazingly, the series will also be shown on 220 channels in 181 countries, and is a group effort from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane\u2019s Fuzzy Door Productions and Cosmos Studios, the company founded in 2000 by Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan\u2019s widow.\n\nImage via YouTube", "80": "Even the president of the United States is into the new \"Cosmos.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama introduced the new TV series \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" last night (March 9) during the FOX premiere of the new show, a reboot of Carl Sagan's original \"Cosmos\" series.\n\n\"America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream bigger and reach farther than others imagine,\" Obama said during his introduction. \"That's the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original 'Cosmos.'

(AP) \u2014 Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel insists there are still plenty of superstars in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe only problem is nobody\u2019s heard of them yet.\n\nOne year after high-profile players such as Alabama\u2019s A.J. McCarron, South Carolina\u2019s Jadeveon Clowney and Texas A&M\u2019s Johnny Manziel brought a rockstar feel to SEC Media Days, the buzz is largely missing this week at the league\u2019s preseason showcase.\n\nPart of the reason is a lack of experienced quarterbacks. McCarron, Manziel, LSU\u2019s Zach Mettenberger, South Carolina\u2019s Connor Shaw and Georgia\u2019s Aaron Murray are gone after impressive careers.\n\nThere are still some accomplished players in the league \u2014 especially at running back. Alabama\u2019s T.J. Yeldon and Georgia\u2019s Todd Gurley are among the nation\u2019s best.\n\nDriskel said it won\u2019t be long before others become nationally known as well.\n\n\u201cSome of the guys haven\u2019t put up the numbers or the championships that guys in the past have,\u201d Driskell said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always going to be talent in the SEC. It\u2019s just a matter of who makes the plays this year. You get guys who end up being household names who weren\u2019t at the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nBut the shadow of Manziel, McCarron and Co. still looms, even months after they played their last college game.\n\nWhen Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin took the podium on Tuesday afternoon, two of the first three questions he received were about Johnny Football.\n\nAfter the second one, an amused Sumlin said \u201cIs this the SEC Media Days?\u201d\n\nThe Aggies are one of several teams moving on without their stars. They had three players selected in the first round of the NFL draft \u2014 which left gaping holes at quarterback, offensive tackle and receiver \u2014 but Sumlin said that\u2019s just part of the challenge of the college game.\n\n\u201cIn college football, every two, three years you\u2019re going to have turnover and you have to have a plan for that,\u201d Sumlin said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s quarterback, whether it\u2019s a great defender, whatever it is. To me that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about college football.\u201d\n\nThat might be true eventually, but right now it means there are a lot of unknowns.\n\nArguably the league\u2019s most recognizable quarterback \u2014 Auburn\u2019s Nick Marshall \u2014 didn\u2019t come to media days after being cited for possession of a small amount of marijuana. Mississippi\u2019s Bo Wallace is the only returning quarterback in the league who threw for at least 2,000 yards last season.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s Dak Prescott and Driskel are among the most intriguing breakout candidates at quarterback.\n\nPrescott threw for 1,940 yards last season and rushed for 829 more as a sophomore despite missing two games because of injuries. Driskel had a promising season in 2012 before missing much of last year with a leg injury.\n\nPrescott said the SEC\u2019s loss of so many star players won\u2019t hurt the quality of the league.\n\n\u201cThose guys were unknown at some point, too, so that\u2019s just part of the game,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cIt leaves the door open for guys to step up and get their name out there.\u201d\n\nThe strength of the league might be at running back, where veterans like Yeldon, Gurley and South Carolina\u2019s Mike Davis return for another season. All three averaged around 100 yards per game during their sophomore seasons and scored at least 10 touchdowns.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good chance some of the league\u2019s best players \u2014 along with the league\u2019s best teams \u2014 are relative unknowns right now.\n\n\u201cNobody picked Missouri and Auburn to win the divisions last year,\u201d South Carolina Steve Spurrier said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we play the game.

Sometimes, reading this many words can take a long time, which cuts into our valuable time. However, guess what? There's a fix for that problem, and it's called Spritz.\n\nSpritz is a text streaming technology that allows readers to run through texts faster. It streams text on the user's screen one word at a time, which allows your brain to comprehend it faster, says the company behind the technology.\n\n\"We're reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,\" said co-Founder and CEO Frank Waldman. \"As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device - the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.\"\n\nThe company claims Spritz can allow an eBook reader to run through a novel in just 90 minutes. That sounds great, but we're not sure if any eBook reader would be interested in speed reading a book, wouldn't that dim the experience and the enjoyment of the book a great deal? We believe this to be true.\n\nHow does the tech work?\n\nSpritz streams one word at a time as noted above. It highlights the \"Optimal Recognition Point\" or ORP of every word in the red, and align certain letters to a specific central point. Apparently, this technique can allow readers to read up to 1,000 words per minute. Then again, it all depends on the user's comfort level, so it should be very possible for the speed to be toned down a little bit.\n\nIt shouldn't take too long for us to see Spritz in action on smart devices.

If yes, well you must try this app. Spritz is a latest app developed by Frank Waldman, Maik Maurer and Jamie Locke - that aims at changing the way people read and make communications faster, easier and effective. The company is a Boston based startup which focuses on text streaming technology and its integration into modern communication.Founders of Spritz believe that the time is consumed for normal reading because of eye movements from word to word and from one sentence to another. Also the way we read consumes a lot of physical space. The Spritz solves both of these problems. The app makes user read only one word at a time and hence user need not to move eyes word-to-word. With Spritz, user doesn\u2019t see the entire page or the sentence, but just 13 characters of the text. The fast streaming of the words make reading easier and comfortable. Reading becomes unpleasant when the screen size is smaller. Spritz also solves this problem as only a word is to be read inside the display-window called \u201credicle\u201d. The display time of a word is decided by the use of proprietary algorithms.According to Spritz, the other techniques to improve reading speed such as skimming (reading important words, rather than all words), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading), reading entire page just by taking a mental snapshot etc takes time to develop reading. Whereas, with Spritz, skill can be developed merely in five minutes. However these methods still includes traditional reading requiring physical space. The app allows user to choose the speed of word streaming ranging from 250 words per minute to 600 words per minute and also to translate the text.How do you like the features of the Spritz app?

A company called Spritz has spent the last few years in stealth mode, developing a technology to help us read even more, in less time.\n\nSpritz\u2014which is both the name of the technology and the verb for using it\u2014streams text on your screen one word at a time, which, the company claims, allows your brain to comprehend it much more quickly and easily. Their trademarked tagline is \u201cReading Reimagined,\u201d and after playing with the technology a bit I have to agree.\n\nSpritz technology enables you to read and comprehend information much faster than normal.\n\nSpritz relies on something the company has dubbed the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP). Spritz claims your brain processes the information it's taking in once your eyes reach the ORP of a given word, and it\u2019s trained to process the data as a complete, coherent thought once it reaches punctuation.\n\nAccording to Spritz, 80 percent of the time you spend reading is devoted to physically moving your eyes from one word to the next in search of the ORP, while only 20 percent is spent actually processing the information. To speed things up, Spritz reformats the text and aligns it based on the ORP so there is essentially no physical eye movement, and almost all of your time is spent taking in data.\n\nThe Spritz Web page explains what makes Spritz different from other speed reading systems: \u201cThere are lots of other reading techniques out there such as skimming (not reading every word), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading) and enlarging the peripheral span (reading an entire page at a time by mental \u201csnapshot\u201d) that attempt to increase reading speeds. While these methods can be effective, achieving significant improvement requires intensive, continuous training and dedication. By contrast, spritzing can be learned in less than 5 minutes and, if you don\u2019t spritz for a month, no practice is needed to return quickly to your previous speed or skill-level.\u201d\n\nI am a more voracious reader than most\u2014but not voracious enough to keep up with the pace at which I buy new books. I have tried different traditional speed reading programs over the years with limited success. Spritz seems to work for me.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to read fiction using Spritz. When I read a Dan Brown novel, or The Hunger Games, I want to take in the nuance of the dialogue. I want to give my brain time to imagine the scene being described, and I want to use sub-vocalization to \u201chear\u201d the different character voices in my head.\n\nFor other texts, however, Spritz would be helpful. Imagine how much more productive you'd be if you could get through all your email in a fifth of the time it normally takes you. I would love to see Amazon partner with Spritz\u2014or just buy it outright\u2014and incorporate the technology as an option when reading a Kindle book.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to take advantage of Spritz, but sadly I\u2019ll have to. Spritz will be pre-installed on the new Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Galaxy Gear 2 smartwatch, but as of right now it\u2019s not available any other way. Hopefully it will soon be incorporated into iOS, or at least into iOS apps.\n\nIf you want to test out Spritz for yourself, visit the Spritz website.

Louis Kahn Mar 10, 2014 10:22 PM EDT\n\nThe new trailer for \"Game of Thrones\" Season 4 has been released. The trailer is nicknamed Vengeance and features a series of characters speaking about justice and avenging the deaths of lost loved ones. What are the clues we can gather about the story-lines in Season 4? And who will be going after who?\n\nThe trailer begins with Arya Stark relaying a list of characters she harbors a death vendetta against. We already know she harbors a grudge against Cercei and Geoffrey Lanister, but she's now added the names of Tywin, Cercei's father, and the \"Red Woman\" otherwise known as Melisandre. How does her new companion, the Hound, relate to her quest to annihilate his former masters?\n\nWe know all of the Stark family is seeking revenge for the brutal scourge of their bloodline acted out in the last three seasons. So few remain, and it seems unlikely there will be any justice for their family's plight. Sansa speaks to Tyrion about being haunted by her family's death. Jon Snow expresses some desire for justice, although it's not made clear whether it will be against the murderers of Robb Stark or attempted mutineers in the army of Mormont.\n\nDaenarys Targeres still wants justice for the great outrage of her family members exile after their father was dethroned. As she is of the original bloodline that sat on the iron throne, she is thirstily building a more and more impressive army to take over Westeros. Appatrently, she also has a jumbo-sized dragon now. But besides all that, there is a clip where a man talks to her about repaying injustice with mercy, intercut with scenes of the siege of a city. What is the specific injustice they are talking about?\n\nThe Red Viper is a new character in this season and makes appearance here alongside Cercei. He himself talks about vengeance to her. He is also seen fighting in an arena. It appears that he has aligned himself with the Lannisters fully. But what are his motives and what does he hope to achieve? Fans of the book say that it will be hard to know what the reasons behind his actions are and what he will wind up doing next.\n\nIf you'd like to view the trailer in its entirety, you may do so here (WARNING: Link may contain strong content).\n\nThe new season of Game of Thrones is scheduled to premiere April 6th on HBO.", "101": "HBO used the True Detective season finale on Sunday night to unleash a third trailer for Game of Thrones Season 4. Dubbed \u201csecrets,\u201d the trailer promises vengeance, action, and some seriously larger dragons.\n\nRevenge is on the mind of the Starks after the events of the red wedding in the penultimate episode of Season 3. Cersei knows this and senses everyone is ready to strike at the Lannisters, and Tywin advises his daughter that no one outside the family circle can be trusted.\n\nSansa Stark gives King Joffrey the evil eye and admits that she lays awake at night, thinking about how her mother and brother were done in. What else can be possibly go through? Or perhaps, what can she do to strike back at the Lannisters and get the heck out of King\u2019s Landing.\n\nOberyn Martell drops his own little line about vengeance to Cersei, and if Cersei is wise, she would take the advice of her father and keep Martell at a distance.\n\nWe also get a new look at Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s three dragons that are noticeably larger than when we last saw them. They\u2019re playing in a field while their proud mother (of dragons) looks on.\n\nThe premiere date for Game of Thrones Season 4 is April 6 on HBO.", "102": "The anticipation for Game of Thrones' fourth season just keeps building.

Her dragons have clearly grown, and so has Dany's drive to take the Iron Throne.\n\n\"Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,\" Ser Barristan Selmy advises her.\n\n\"I will answer injustice with justice,\" Daenerys replies resolutely.\n\nAs a further tease, HBO has also released summaries for the first four episodes of season 4.\n\nEpisode 1, \"The Two Swords\":\n\n\"Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King's Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities.

Just recently, David Benioff and his team released a dark trailer that surprisingly revealed more information about the upcoming season than we had ever anticipated.\n\nThe clip began with a scene between Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as she opens up about the death of her family members.\n\n\u201cYou know what they did to my brother and my mother,\u201d she said referring to the bloody Red Wedding where Catelyn and Robb were unexpectedly murdered. Ironically, it\u2019s Tyrion\u2019s family who was behind the massacre. Tywin gave Lord Walder Frey his word that if he was to deceive the Starks after breaking bread (guest right) that he would protect the treacherous royal.\n\n\u201cI lie awake all night thinking about how they died,\u201d she continued. Tyrion looked empathetic as he listened to Sansa pour her heart out. But don\u2019t expect Turner\u2019s character to bawl her eyes out during Season 4. According to the \u201cGoT\u201d actress, Sansa will be cracking skulls and taking names in the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a big evolution [for Sansa in Season 4],\u201d Turner told Wet Paint about the development of her character. \u201cShe begins to kind of manipulate the people who have done wrong to her in her past. She becomes a good powerhouse character but in a very subtle way. It\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\n\"I feel like I've been waiting for a moment where I can manipulate the people that have come before me, so it was like I had been waiting for it for so long. It was a release,\u201d Turner said.\n\nBut Sansa won\u2019t be the only female character from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to be sharpening her sword. According to the promo, Cersei Baratheon (Lena Headey) will also be preparing for vengeance.\n\n\u201cWhat good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?\u201d Cersei says. \u201cWe can avenge them,\u201d she\u2019s told.\n\nJon Snow (Kit Harington) then makes his way into the trailer on horseback.\n\n\u201cAll that time I was gone the world\u2019s fallen apart,\u201d he said. He\u2019s right, things have gotten a bit crazy in the world of the Westeros. From undead icemen to territorial dragons, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is picking up the pace rapidly when it comes to drama.\n\n\u201cAlways keep your foes confused. If they don\u2019t know who you are or what you want they can\u2019t know what you plan to do next,\u201d Little Finger advised in the Season 4 promo.\n\nOne of the most exciting scenes in the promo deals with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) who will be attempting to take on another slave city\u2014Meereen. In Episode 1, \u201cTwo Swords,\u201d the Mother of Dragons will be attempting take overrun Meereen, which would bring her one step closer to reclaiming the Iron Throne.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to answer injustice with mercy,\u201d Daenerys is counseled.\n\n\u201cI will answer injustice with justice,\u201d she responds.\n\nIt looks like the blond haired beauty will be even a bigger force during Season 4 as she tries to become more than the just the mother of dragons.\n\nOther scenes from the promo include Ygritte getting reprimanded for letting Snow ride off, Cersei locking lips with Oberyn and Bran attempts to survive north of the wall.\n\nAre you excited for Season 4 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d?

Check out what might happen in the series below.\n\n[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\n1. Season 4, Episode 1: Two Swords.\n\n\"In the books, the Lannisters add one final insult to the late Ned Stark when they melt down his sword 'Ice' and forge two new ones for Jamie and Joffrey. It's likely this ep. focuses on the very different man Jamie has become, especially in contrast to his psychotic nephew son.\"\n\n2. Season 4, Episode 2: The Lion and the Rose.\n\n\"The lion is the symbol of house Lannister, the rose house Tyrell - so we can assume this is the episode in which Joffrey and Margery tie the knot. Their nuptials have been dubbed 'he purple wedding' by fans, but you'll have to watch events unfold to find out why! \"\n\n3. Season 4, Episode 3: Breaker of Chains.\n\n\"'Breaker Of Chains' is yet another moniker for Daenerys Targaryen, so we can assume this ep will be focused on her. What she'll be doing is debatable, as Dany and her pals are some of the characters that most liberties seem to have been taken with in season 4, due to the fact that they're actually not featured that much in the books at this point.\"\n\n4. Season 4, Episode 4: Oathkeeper.\n\n\"Back to those swords again. Joffrey names his 'Widow Maker'...while Jamie names his, you guessed it, 'Oathkeeper'. In the books he actually gives the sword to Brienne and instructs her to keep her word to Caitlen Stark by seeking out and protecting her remaining children.\"", "105": "Game of Thrones' third season featured a whole lot of treachery, back-stabbing, and duplicitous action that gave rise to bloody murder, even by the ultra-popular HBO medieval fantasy/intrigue drama's standards. It's no wonder then that nearly everyone in Westeros is looking for some kind of vengeance, retribution or similar form of payback as season 4 picks up. (Well, unless you're King Joffrey, in which case you're waving around unearned bragging rights about having already won the war for the Iron Throne.)\n\nOf course, Tyrion Lannister has shared a few key words of wisdom on that subject: \"If you want justice, you're come to the wrong place,\" which is a hard lesson that remains to be learned by the remaining Starks, even as events conspire to reveal the true allegiances among King's Landing's residents - meaning that Joffrey could soon get the punishment he deserves, though it won't necessarily be for reasons that have anything to do with moral righteousness.\n\nThe list of those still playing the game grows shorter every season, though we still count Peter Dinklage (X-Men: Days of Future Past), Lena Headey (Dredd), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Oblivion), Emilia Clarke (Terminator: Genesis), Kit Harington (Pompeii), and Maisie Williams (Gold) among its contestants.\n\nNo one is truly safe on Game of Thrones this season, as even those who don't wind up kicking the bucket can suffer in other ways. For evidence of that, see the mounting emotional trauma that's been inflicted upon Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), or the permanent debilitating physical injuries that Jaime Lannister (Waldau) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) were dealt last season.\n\nMeanwhile, as the latest trailer and past-unveiled previews for season 4 alike have reminded us, there are far greater developments unfolding in the southern and northern portions of the Game of Thrones universe. Dany's habit of conquering every kingdom that crosses her path - coupled with her increasingly large (and uncontrollable) dragons - will eventually make the various machinations at King's Landing seem rather trivial. On the other side of the world, though, there's not just an army of Wildlings ready to storm The Wall, but also a legion of White Walkers lurking out in the bitter cold.\n\nQuestion is, by the time that winter does finally arrive (figuratively and literally), will there be so many players left standing? If not, well, at least all those invaders from the North and South will have all that lovely countryside to appreciate by themselves - and then fight each other to death while claiming it for themselves, naturally.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nGame of Thrones season 4 begins airing on HBO on April 6th, 2014.\n\nSource: HBO\n\nNew Popeye Animated Short Series Premieres On YouTube", "106": "[ad id=\u201d1211\u2033] More details have emerged around the way the story of Game Of Thrones will turn in the new series.

If you haven't seen the March 10 finale of The Bachelor, avert your eyes now.\n\nHappily ever after doesn't look all that happy for Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis and his chosen lady, Nikki Ferrell. The two were reunited in public for the first time since filming the finale on Monday's After the Final Rose special, and things got pretty awkward pretty quickly. Let's recap!\n\nThe ATFR special kicks off with Bachelor host Chris Harrison introducing Juan Pablo's runner-up, hairstylist Clare Crawley, who is as angry now as she was when Juan Pablo sent her packing in St. Lucia. Clare admits she should have left after the so-called helicopter incident in the finale, but says she \"trusted that there was a man here that wanted what [she] wanted.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes\n\nNot so much anymore, though. Clare is done with Juan Pablo's excuses and explanations \u2014 so much so that she declines to sit down with him in front of the live studio audience. \"I don\u2019t want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more BS,\" she explains, adding that she said all she needed to say in St. Lucia.\n\nOn that note, it's time to bring out Juan Pablo! The Venezuelan-born Bachelor is unapologetic about giving Clare the boot, telling Chris Harrison he stands by his choice. \"I made the decision that was best for me,\" he says, \"and it is what it is.\" Chris gives Juan Pablo a bit of a hard time about his treatment of Clare in the helicopter, but Juan Pablo refuses to take the bait, saying only that he has \"nothing bad\" to say about her, regardless of what she says about him.\n\nPHOTOS: Bachelor proposals, promise rings, and breakups\n\nMaybe Nikki will be more talkative? Chris puts Juan Pablo's chosen lady in the hot seat next, and though she insists she's \"very happy\" with the Bachelor, she admits he has yet to tell her he loves her. \"He hasn't ever said those words to you?\" Chris asks her. \"Does that worry you?\"\n\nNikki insists it doesn't, but Chris doesn't seem convinced. Juan Pablo apparently has a \"big surprise\" planned, though \u2014 something he promised an \"ABC executive\" while in St. Lucia.\n\nSo is this \"big surprise\" a ring? An \"I love you\"? None of the above, actually. In fact, Juan Pablo says there is no surprise, and even goes so far as to declare that he and Nikki are \"done with this show\" for good. \"We are so done,\" he says.\n\nPHOTOS: Failed reality TV romances\n\nAsked by Chris how he feels about Nikki, Juan Pablo avoids the L-word, saying only, \"We feel great,\" which prompts Chris to ask again, \"So you love her?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that question. People don't understand that this is real life\u2026We are happy we had the opportunity,\" he says. \"It's been tough\u2026It hasn't been easy. What I'm feeling with Nikki is fantastic.\"\n\nFantastic might be an overstatement, but Nikki backs him up. \"I just feel like, time will tell,\" she says. \"This is a real relationship to us.\"\n\nTell Us: Do you think Juan Pablo and Nikki will go the distance?\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?\"\n\nAlthough Ferrell accepted the rose, she seemed to have been expecting a proposal. On various occasions Ferrell had professed her love for Galavis, but he has never returned the sentiment.\n\nIs marriage on the cards for Ferrell and Galavis? Only time will tell.\n\nMeanwhile, Clare Crawley left with a heavy heart saying Galavis was not the man she was expecting.\n\nWhen the single dad approached Crawley and said that he would have to send her home, she was livid and said that she stuck around because she believed in him.\n\n\"I lost respect for you ... I thought I knew what kind of man you were. But what you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,\" Crawley said before walking away.\n\nAnd Galavis' response? \"Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her.\"\n\nReferring to an off-camera moment the couple had, Clare said that she gave Galavis another chance to come closer when he said he doesn't know her at all. But it ended badly when he took her on a helicopter date and insulted her.\n\nAn insider told Wetpaint that \"Clare asked Juan Pablo, \"Just tell me you love me,\" knowing that Galavis may be hesitant to declare his love on camera. And he said, \"I really loved f\u2014ing you.\"\n\nBack in the studio live after the final rose segment, both Galavis and Ferrell looked awkward and refused to speak about their relationship.\n\nThis was unlike the previous seasons when the couple expressed their relief at being able to flaunt their relationship after three months of hiding.\n\nFerrell was also not wearing an engagement ring, indicating that their relationship had not proceeded further.\n\nThe situation became even more awkward when \"The Bachelor\" host Chris Harrison asked Galavis if he loved Ferrell.\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that question,\" Galavis said. \"People don't understand this is real life. We're very happy and we are so done with the show.\"\n\n\"So\u2026.you're not gonna tell us you love her?\" a confused Harrison asks. \"This is what this show is about. We're on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.\"\n\nBut the couple remained evasive and explained that although they have made plans for the future, they would not divulge the details.\n\nThe show ended with Harrison announcing Andi Dorfman as the next Bachelorette.\n\nThe new season of \"The Bachelorette\" will premiere on 19 May.", "115": "It's rumored that Nikki Ferrell is the last woman standing on this season of The Bachelor but a deleted scene shows that Juan Pablo considered spending the rest of his life with contestant Clare Crawley.\n\nClare Leaves Juan Pablo in Tears\n\nIn the clip Juan Pablo grabbed his phone making Crawley think that he's about to \"take a selfie.\" Instead, he played a romantic song before setting his phone on the table.\n\nCrawley was instantly taken aback and said, \"I love this song\" before kissing Juan Pablo. and shedding a tear or two.\n\nJuan Pablo Gives Final Rose to Nikki Ferrell?\n\nJuan Pablo comforted Crawley and referenced the song when he said, \"We started like that. Don't cry.\"\n\nShe tried to kiss Juan Pablo back but couldn't help but cry as the singer sung, \"I never thought I'd feel this way for another.\"\n\nCrawley explained her breakdown during a confessional interview.\n\nShe said, \"I am lost in the moment. That song is how I feel and how I felt.\"\n\nShe asked Juan Pablo if he was a fan of the song and said, \"You should just play it when we get married.\"\n\nThe former Venezuelan soccer star played coy and didn't respond to Crawleys' comment with words but kissed her instead.\n\nCrawley confessed, \"This is our song. I feel like it's our moment...And I hope that this song will be played at our wedding someday.\"\n\nJuan Pablo showed off his goofy side as he sung along to the song.\n\nCrawley added, \"Juan Pablo has definitely helped break down those walls that have been up around my heart.\n\nCheck out the video below and tune in to The Bachelor season finale Monday March 9 at 8/7c on ABC.\n\nSee Now: Famous Actors Who Turned Down Iconic Movie Roles", "116": "Whew. The worst \u2014 and most bizarre \u2014 season of \"The Bachelor\" is finally over.\n\nAfter a rocky season filled with tears, anger and controversial comments, Bachelor Juan Pablo did not get down on one knee to propose to a lucky bride-to-be in Saint Lucia. Instead, he offered the last woman standing, Nikki Ferrell, just a rose.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine spending my life without you,\u201d Nikki, 26, told Juan Pablo, clearly expecting a diamond ring. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see you as a good stepmom for Camilla,\u201d Juan Pablo, 32, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a perfect time every time I\u2019m with you.\u201d\n\nThen it got awkward.\n\n\u201cI have a ring here in my pocket and I\u2019m not going to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I\u2019m 100 percent sure that I don\u2019t want to let you go.

The words he used\u2026I can\u2019t even repeat it.\u201d\n\nClare cited Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman, two women who exited the show as soon as they weren\u2019t feeling the relationship.\n\n\u201cYou had every opportunity like those other girls did to tell me how you felt,\u201d she said. \u201cI lose respect for you.

Juan Pablo\u2019s comment under his breath when Clare ran away in tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her.\u201d\n\nThe show got even more bizarre during the live \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d special after the taped finale.\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki made their first appearance in public together, and while most \u201cBachelor\u201d couples gush about finally being able to appear together after three months of hiding, profess their love repeatedly and show off engagement rings, the mood was quite awkward and emotionless.\n\n\u201cSo you love her?\u201d host Chris Harrison asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question,\u201d Juan Pablo said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand this is real life. We\u2019re very happy and we are so done with the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026.you\u2019re not gonna tell us you love her?\u201d Chris asked, obviously baffled. \u201cThis is what this show is about. We\u2019re on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.\u201d\n\nChris polled former \u201cBachelor\u201d alums in the audience, newlyweds Catherine and Sean Lowe, who tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he signed up for a reality show and the spotlight is part of the deal.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that fed you,\u201d Catherine said, to loud applause from the studio audience.\n\n\u201cThis is a real relationship to us,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it very seriously. He has a daughter, he doesn\u2019t just have himself to think about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry the show didn\u2019t end up like you guys wanted it to,\u201d Juan Pablo said, to boos from the audience.\n\n\u201cThis is so awkward,\u201d Chris said laughing, as he tried one more time to get just a bit of information from the couple by asking them their plans for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have our plans,\u201d Juan Pablo said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we want to keep private.\u201d\n\n\u201cBachelor\u201d fans breathed a collective sigh of relief when the show cut to a commercial break and Chris was able to announce the new Bachelorette \u2014 Atlanta assistant district attorney and fan-favorite \u2014 Andi.\n\nThe new season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d premiers May 19.", "117": "HOME > The Bachelor > The Bachelor 18 'The Bachelor' star Juan Pablo Galavis selects Nikki Ferrell as his final bachelorette and gives her a rose -- but that's it!\n\nBy Elizabeth Kwiatkowski, 03/11/2014\n\n\n\nstar\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, MO, received Juan Pablo's final rose and the phrase, \"I like you a lot,\" from star.\n\n\n\n\"Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket, but I'm not going to use it. I'm not 100 percent sure,\" Juan Pablo admitted to Nikki, who nodded her head in reply but seemed upset by the news.\n\n\n\n\"But at the same time, I am 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot -- a lot. So, Nikki, would you accept my final rose?\" Juan Pablo asked her.\n\n\n\nNikki, again, nodded her head. After hesitating for a moment, she replied, \"Absolutely,\" and kissed him. Juan Pablo thanked her for accepting his last rose and then jokingly told her not to get cranky since it was so hot outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n's eighteenth-season finale began with the remaining two bachelorettes, Nikki and Clare, meeting Juan Pablo's family in Saint Lucia.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo met up with his mother and father, brother, sister, cousin, niece and his four-year-old daughter Camila. Clare met his family first, and Juan Pablo told the cameras he liked her a lot, their connection was \"on fire\" and she had many qualities he liked.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo just wondered how she'd interact with his family and whether she'd fit in with them. Clare was nervous but hoped Juan Pablo would see an amazing connection between herself and his family. She thought Juan Pablo was so hot with his daughter and it was obvious they loved each other very much.\n\n\n\nClare thought Juan Pablo's family was wonderful, kind and welcoming. Clare told Juan Pablo's relatives she sincerely looked forward to having many children. Clare then asked his mother Nelly whether Juan Pablo has any personality traits he probably wouldn't share with or admit to her, and the mother said he's \"hyperactive\" and \"sometimes very rude.\"\n\n\n\nSomehow, Clare said her feelings for Juan Pablo were reconfirmed after that conversation.\n\n\n\nClare then assured Juan Pablo's cousin Rodolfo she wouldn't run if she encountered any problems with the Bachelor. She said if Juan Pablo proposed to her, it'd be the best day of her life. Rodolfo basically told his cousin that Clare was \"begging\" to marry and have kids with him.\n\nFOLLOW REALITY TV WORLD ON THE ALL-NEW GOOGLE NEWS!\n\nReality TV World is now available on the all-new Google News app and website. Click here to visit our Google News page, and then click FOLLOW to add us as a news source!\n\nRodolfo told him to go \"all in\" if he felt he had found a wife, and Juan Pablo's brother Rodrigo thought Clare was super sincere and down to earth, a perfect fit for him. Clare could envision being a part of that family forever, and she said Juan Pablo had stolen her heart.\n\n\n\nLater on, Nikki met Juan Pablo's family and she truly wanted to make a good impression on them. Nikki said it was a fun, whirlwind of an experience and she learned a lot about herself throughout the journey. She felt blessed to have \"met someone really special.\"\n\n\n\nNikki told Juan Pablo's father Saul that the Bachelor wouldn't be who he is today if he hadn't been a father and she loved who he is because of that. Juan Pablo's dad said he's \"not an easy guy,\" suggesting he's a little self-centered and very focused on particular things he wants in life.\n\n\n\nNikki said she knew Juan Pablo was stubborn but she was ready to be with all of him as a person. Juan Pablo's mom also told Nikki her son was a very simple guy who watched TV a lot with his family and daughter. As much as Juan Pablo apparently loves relaxing and watching sports, Nikki said she loved Juan Pablo and was sure he's the guy she had been looking for.\n\n\n\nRodolfo explained to Nikki that while he believed Juan Pablo was a great guy, he knew that the Bachelor ran at any sign of trouble. Juan Pablo apparently walks away and leaves when things get rough in a relationship.\n\n\n\nAfter meeting both girls, Rodrigo thought both girls would be \"a good choice\" for Juan Pablo, who could see a future with both women.\n\n\n\n\"Can I keep both?\" Juan Pablo asked in a confessional.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his final one-on-one date with Clare. He knew there was potential with both women and didn't know what to do. He had a big decision to make. The pair got a beautiful view of Saint Lucia via a helicopter ride. Clare was falling more in love with each passing moment, and Juan Pablo said she was \"sexy, hot and cute.\"\n\n\n\nThe couple then landed at Commerette Point and things suddenly took a drastic turn for the worst.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\"He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear, that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing. I don't even want to repeat it. It was insulting, it was offensive, and it just made me feel awful. Every single woman deserves to be treated with respect. I'm not just an object. Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"\n\n\n\nClare continued, \"I'm so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next. I thought that this was going to be one of the most romantic moments of my life, but it wasn't. Knowing that this was or could be our last date ever, if he can't tell me that he knows me and this relationship goes further than a physical connection, I'm out of here.\"\n\n\n\nThat night, at The Landing hotel, Clare thought about what happened that day when no cameras were on the couple and they didn't have microphones recording their every word.\n\n\n\n\"He leaned over and then he said, 'I feel like we don't know each other. You don't know me. I don't know you.' He chooses not to say something romantic but that he loved hooking up with me. What he said and the words he used, I cant even repeat it,\" Clare said in a confessional.\n\n\n\nClare admitted she felt like she was going down the road of her past relationships again in which the men didn't see more than the physical and didn't really care to have more going on between them than the physical relationship. Clare said she went on the show for love, \"not just a hookup.\"\n\n\n\nClare then invited Juan Pablo to her hotel room to talk and denied him a kiss when he walked in. Juan Pablo seemed like he had no idea what was going on. asked Clare to remind him what he had said wrong in the helicopter, and when Clare mentioned he had brought up things about what happened when they were alone, the Bachelor jumped on the conversation and noted, \"What happens in private stays in private.\"\n\n\n\nClare explained to him how he had said they had good chemistry but didn't know each other well enough. Juan Pablo insisted she misunderstood what he said. Clare noted that what she wants in a relationship is way beyond just the physical.\n\n\n\n\"I don't need the physical anymore,\" Juan Pablo interjected.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo told Clare to her face that there were parts of her that he liked and parts he didn't like and she probably felt the same way about him -- that maybe there were \"many parts\" she wouldn't know and like about him. Clare was taken aback by that, but Juan Pablo said he was just trying to be honest with her. Juan Pablo said it was hard to figure out how he felt given his situation.\n\n\n\nClare told the cameras she could deal with honesty but it just felt like the end. She explained that if Juan Pablo wasn't sure about his feelings for her, she'd be out, because she thought she had a lot to offer a man.\n\n\n\nClare was just confused because she thought they were on the same page prior to the helicopter incident. She was uncertain whether Juan Pablo even wanted to learn more about her and get to know her. She was getting prepared to book a ticket home from Saint Lucia depending on his answers.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo argued that her \"no kissing rule\" earlier in the season in South Korea was the best thing he ever heard, however, he jokingly said she went back on her word and that wasn't his fault. Juan Pablo tried to convince her that he could see himself with her and it was more than just a physical attraction.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\"That's a good question because a proposal for me and my daughter is huge, and I've been thinking for a week already. 'Am I ready?' is my question. 'Do I know the person as much as I know I would love to know somebody?'\" Juan Pablo explained.\n\n\n\nClare told him that's what she wanted to hear. She wanted to hear more than, \"I like kissing you, I like kissing you.\" Juan Pablo said he wanted her there and she was \"special\" to him. He could see them having a baby or two within a couple months if they ended up together, and he assured her that he \"honestly\" felt great with her. Clare was convinced at that point they had \"a lot more\" going on than she feared.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo talked to Clare about what things may be like four months down the road and how they'd deal with being apart while the show aired. Clare seemed to take that as a sure sign he'd pick her in the end.\n\n\n\n\"We had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one. I just know it and I feel really good about that. I like that girl a lot,\" Juan Pablo said in a confessional.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want a rose, I want forever,\" Clare said.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his one-on-one date with Nikki. He knew that Nikki was in love with him, but he needed to figure out his own feelings. Nikki loved him so much but admitted the one thing missing from her fairytale was hearing how Juan Pablo felt about her in return, as she believed he was a \"cautious\" man who was afraid to get hurt.\n\n\n\nNikki then confronted Juan Pablo about how she believed he might be \"a little guarded\" and maybe \"scared to open up.\" star immediately rejected that notion.\n\n\n\n\"When I feel it, I will open up. So, I'm not, I'm not guarded,\" Juan Pablo told her.\n\n\n\nNikki was a little worried about whether Juan Pablo loved her, yet he made her feel very comfortable. She didn't see him having their type of connection with anyone else. Nikki said she'd be \"heartbroken\" if that day was her last day ever with Juan Pablo, but she was trying not to stress it.\n\n\n\nWhen she asked what life would be like after all their fancy dates were over, Juan Pablo said there would be a lot of TV watching -- such as sports -- and he'd do that alone often times. Nikki didn't seem overly alarmed by that statement.\n\n\n\nThat night, the couple talked some more and she needed to hear him say, \"I love you.\" The pair acknowledged how their journey was almost over and Nikki told him the idea of that was a little scary because she was \"head over heels in love with him.\"\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nNikki then gave Juan Pablo a heartfelt, emotional card that he read aloud, once again expressing her love and admiration for him. In response, Juan Pablo kissed her multiple times yet said nothing, and she seemed very sad and unsatisfied. When he left, she broke down into tears on the couch.\n\n\n\nWhen it became time for the season's final Rose Ceremony, both women felt confident they'd end up as Juan Pablo's fiancee. They were looking forward to starting a life with him and ending their fairytales on a high note. Clare was picturing a ring on her left hand, while Nikki noted, \"I know it's me. He can't have what he has with me with anyone else.\"\n\n\n\nClare was the first woman to meet\n\n\n\nClare trusted Juan Pablo and knew everything was going to be okay, because he had always promised her that. Clare acknowledged her deceased father would be very proud of her for opening up, and she didn't think Juan Pablo had any doubts about their relationship when examining their last conversation.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo had little to say at first, so Clare expressed how -- despite all her previous questions and concerns -- she believed in Juan Pablo and knew they had something special.\n\n\n\nAfter telling Clare they had some ups and downs, fixed their issues, and she was still there because he wanted her there, Juan Pablo broke the bad news.\n\n\n\n\"You are unbelievable, such an amazing woman. Um, I wish the earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever. I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along, and I've been very honest since the beginning to everybody that, at some point, some people are going to go home. I have to follow what I think is best for me, and I have to say goodbye to you,\" Juan Pablo told Clare.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo tried to wrap his arms around Clare and embrace her, but she coldly rejected the gesture.\n\n\n\n\"This entire time, I stuck around because I believed in you. The other night on our last date, when we spent our last hour together, I needed that reassurance, and I gave you that opportunity right then because I've been scared to death. And for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento, that you can see yourself if we got together and had our babies -- I wanted to do it because I believed in us. I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you are,\" Clare calmly said with tears in her eyes.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo tried to interrupt her, but Clare snapped, \"I'm not done.\"\n\n\n\n\"And [\n\n\n\n\"Do you know how I feel? Do you know when I made my decision?\" Juan Pablo asked the bachelorette.\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me,\" Clare said as she walked away. \"I lost respect for you, because I'll tell you what, I thought I knew what kind of man you are. What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,\" Clare said.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo just kept repeating \"okay\" throughout her speech as if he didn't really care about anything she was saying.\n\n\n\n\"Oof, I'm glad I didn't pick her,\" Juan Pablo said after she left. \"Oof.\"\n\n\n\nIn her final words, Clare repeated some of the statements she had already made to Juan Pablo. She truly had faith in him and so it was very disappointing. She never ran even when she wanted to and felt weak.\n\n\n\n\"It's easy to just kiss and show your feelings. But don't tell me you 'love f-cking me.' Don't tell me that,\" Clare told the cameras.\n\n\n\n\"That, to me, is not a man... Don't tell me how much your family loved me. Just don't say anything. Don't say anything. I know it's about following your heart. I know it's about standing up for what you want... But right now, it just hurts my heart. Where is the man that makes me feel like I'm worth it, the man who would fight for me? Where is that man who would fight for me?\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo, according to\n\n\n\nAfterward, Chris walked Nikki to Juan Pablo once she arrived at the quiet beach. She wondered whether the day might not go as she had planned, but she knew there was a great chance she'd end up engaged and she really wanted that.\n\n\n\nNikki couldn't imagine what Juan Pablo was going through and couldn't wait to hear everything she had been waiting for him to say. Nikki wanted to hear that he loved her and she was anticipating it would be the best day of her life.\n\n\n\nOnce they were face to face, Nikki thanked Juan Pablo for everything and said their experience had been amazing and he was an amazing person. She said she wanted to be a part of his family and his life. Nikki noted she never felt that way before about anyone and she didn't expect to feel that way, but she was glad she did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.\n\n\n\n\"I can't imagine spending my life without you. I don't want it to stop and I don't think it will. I love you,\" Nikki told Juan Pablo.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo had tears in his eyes and took a deep breath. He told Nikki that he loved so many things about her -- how she cared about other people, her honesty, her ability to be a good stepmom to Camila, and how every time with her was a perfect time.\n\n\n\nHowever, Juan Pablo reiterated how her father had demanded he only propose if he was completely 100 percent sure of Nikki and the decision he was making. It then became very apparent that Juan Pablo was not certain he wanted to be engaged to his final bachelorette. That's when he gave Nikki his final rose.\n\n\n\nDuring : After the Final Rose special, Clare admitted to\n\n\n\nClare explained her heart was open and her guard was down, which is why she didn't leave him. She thought he was serious about marriage but got the closure she needed by unloading on Juan Pablo the day of the finale. Clare didn't care to see him again in person because she didn't want to be fed anymore \"B-S.\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo then sat in the hotseat and told Chris he did what he felt was right for him and things worked out the way they were supposed to. He said he didn't know what he was going to do that day of the finale yet he had no regrets about Clare. Juan Pablo also said he was \"being himself\" in the helicopter with Clare when she complained he had made \"offensive\" comments.\n\n\n\nNikki then got onstage and said she's still in love with Juan Pablo and things are going great between them. Juan Pablo apparently has yet to say, \"I love you,\" back, but Nikki explained his actions speak louder than words. She admitted it's been a struggle that Juan Pablo opts out of saying, \"I love you,\" but at the same time, she was sure he was invested in their relationship and dedicated to making it work.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo explained he was looking forward to no longer having to hide their relationship, as things were hush-hush over the last four months since filming concluded. He noted they're now happy and free and he feels \"fantastic\" about Nikki. After Chris kept probing Juan Pablo to open up about Nikki more, the host just came out with the question everyone was wondering.\n\n\n\n\"So you love her?\" Chris asked Juan Pablo very bluntly.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that question to you. I don't get it. I don't get it,\" Juan Pablo replied.\n\n\n\n\"People don't understand that this is real life. When you're with somebody, you don't say you love her or not if you're there or not... Whenever you feel you love someone, you [say it]... We are done with the show. We are so done and very happy that we had the opportunity to be part of it and that we met each other through it. I appreciate the opportunity... It's been tough. You guys have been boxing with me... It hasn't been easy.\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo said he's just been honest with people all along, and Nikki is okay with everything because she realized they had \"a real relationship.\" They kept repeating how happy they are and Nikki said only time will tell if Juan Pablo falls in love with her.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo gave no answers about what's next for them but admitted there had been a \"drastic change of plans\" after he learned something from the show's producers about two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nWhile Juan Pablo declined to elaborate further, his comments appeared to refer to prior reports that he had been expecting to follow the footsteps of former Bachelor\n\n\n\n\"Another season of has come to an end. Not going to lie, I'm okay moving on,\" Chris said later on.\n\n\n\nThe special concluded with Chris confirming Andi is the next ette star. She's \"speechless\" about the opportunity and definitely \"looking to find that great love.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you fall in love, don't be afraid to say that,\" Chris told Andi in a sarcastic tone, clearly taking a shot at Juan Pablo.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW REALITY TV WORLD ON GOOGLE NEWS star Juan Pablo Galavis picked Nikki Ferrell as his final bachelorette -- but didn't propose marriage or reveal his love to her -- during Monday night's finale broadcast of the eighteenth season of the ABC reality dating show.Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, MO, received Juan Pablo's final rose and the phrase, \"I like you a lot,\" from star.\"Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket, but I'm not going to use it. I'm not 100 percent sure,\" Juan Pablo admitted to Nikki, who nodded her head in reply but seemed upset by the news.\"But at the same time, I am 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot -- a lot. So, Nikki, would you accept my final rose?\" Juan Pablo asked her.Nikki, again, nodded her head. After hesitating for a moment, she replied, \"Absolutely,\" and kissed him. Juan Pablo thanked her for accepting his last rose and then jokingly told her not to get cranky since it was so hot outside. Clare Crawley , a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, CA, finished as the heartbroken yet angry runner-up.'s eighteenth-season finale began with the remaining two bachelorettes, Nikki and Clare, meeting Juan Pablo's family in Saint Lucia.Juan Pablo met up with his mother and father, brother, sister, cousin, niece and his four-year-old daughter Camila. Clare met his family first, and Juan Pablo told the cameras he liked her a lot, their connection was \"on fire\" and she had many qualities he liked.Juan Pablo just wondered how she'd interact with his family and whether she'd fit in with them. Clare was nervous but hoped Juan Pablo would see an amazing connection between herself and his family. She thought Juan Pablo was so hot with his daughter and it was obvious they loved each other very much.Clare thought Juan Pablo's family was wonderful, kind and welcoming. Clare told Juan Pablo's relatives she sincerely looked forward to having many children. Clare then asked his mother Nelly whether Juan Pablo has any personality traits he probably wouldn't share with or admit to her, and the mother said he's \"hyperactive\" and \"sometimes very rude.\"Somehow, Clare said her feelings for Juan Pablo were reconfirmed after that conversation.Clare then assured Juan Pablo's cousin Rodolfo she wouldn't run if she encountered any problems with the Bachelor. She said if Juan Pablo proposed to her, it'd be the best day of her life. Rodolfo basically told his cousin that Clare was \"begging\" to marry and have kids with him.Rodolfo told him to go \"all in\" if he felt he had found a wife, and Juan Pablo's brother Rodrigo thought Clare was super sincere and down to earth, a perfect fit for him. Clare could envision being a part of that family forever, and she said Juan Pablo had stolen her heart.Later on, Nikki met Juan Pablo's family and she truly wanted to make a good impression on them. Nikki said it was a fun, whirlwind of an experience and she learned a lot about herself throughout the journey. She felt blessed to have \"met someone really special.\"Nikki told Juan Pablo's father Saul that the Bachelor wouldn't be who he is today if he hadn't been a father and she loved who he is because of that. Juan Pablo's dad said he's \"not an easy guy,\" suggesting he's a little self-centered and very focused on particular things he wants in life.Nikki said she knew Juan Pablo was stubborn but she was ready to be with all of him as a person. Juan Pablo's mom also told Nikki her son was a very simple guy who watched TV a lot with his family and daughter. As much as Juan Pablo apparently loves relaxing and watching sports, Nikki said she loved Juan Pablo and was sure he's the guy she had been looking for.Rodolfo explained to Nikki that while he believed Juan Pablo was a great guy, he knew that the Bachelor ran at any sign of trouble. Juan Pablo apparently walks away and leaves when things get rough in a relationship.After meeting both girls, Rodrigo thought both girls would be \"a good choice\" for Juan Pablo, who could see a future with both women.\"Can I keep both?\" Juan Pablo asked in a confessional.The next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his final one-on-one date with Clare. He knew there was potential with both women and didn't know what to do. He had a big decision to make. The pair got a beautiful view of Saint Lucia via a helicopter ride. Clare was falling more in love with each passing moment, and Juan Pablo said she was \"sexy, hot and cute.\"The couple then landed at Commerette Point and things suddenly took a drastic turn for the worst.\"So as the helicopter's landing, Juan Pablo and I have a rare moment together with no cameras, nobody there with us -- except the pilot -- and Juan Pablo leaned over and whispered something to me. But what I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. I'm just shocked. It's just something that he said in that moment to me, I almost don't have words for it -- how I feel right now,\" Clare told the cameras.\"He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear, that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing. I don't even want to repeat it. It was insulting, it was offensive, and it just made me feel awful. Every single woman deserves to be treated with respect. I'm not just an object. Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"Clare continued, \"I'm so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next. I thought that this was going to be one of the most romantic moments of my life, but it wasn't. Knowing that this was or could be our last date ever, if he can't tell me that he knows me and this relationship goes further than a physical connection, I'm out of here.\"That night, at The Landing hotel, Clare thought about what happened that day when no cameras were on the couple and they didn't have microphones recording their every word.\"He leaned over and then he said, 'I feel like we don't know each other. You don't know me. I don't know you.' He chooses not to say something romantic but that he loved hooking up with me. What he said and the words he used, I cant even repeat it,\" Clare said in a confessional.Clare admitted she felt like she was going down the road of her past relationships again in which the men didn't see more than the physical and didn't really care to have more going on between them than the physical relationship. Clare said she went on the show for love, \"not just a hookup.\"Clare then invited Juan Pablo to her hotel room to talk and denied him a kiss when he walked in. Juan Pablo seemed like he had no idea what was going on. asked Clare to remind him what he had said wrong in the helicopter, and when Clare mentioned he had brought up things about what happened when they were alone, the Bachelor jumped on the conversation and noted, \"What happens in private stays in private.\"Clare explained to him how he had said they had good chemistry but didn't know each other well enough. Juan Pablo insisted she misunderstood what he said. Clare noted that what she wants in a relationship is way beyond just the physical.\"I don't need the physical anymore,\" Juan Pablo interjected.Juan Pablo told Clare to her face that there were parts of her that he liked and parts he didn't like and she probably felt the same way about him -- that maybe there were \"many parts\" she wouldn't know and like about him. Clare was taken aback by that, but Juan Pablo said he was just trying to be honest with her. Juan Pablo said it was hard to figure out how he felt given his situation.Clare told the cameras she could deal with honesty but it just felt like the end. She explained that if Juan Pablo wasn't sure about his feelings for her, she'd be out, because she thought she had a lot to offer a man.Clare was just confused because she thought they were on the same page prior to the helicopter incident. She was uncertain whether Juan Pablo even wanted to learn more about her and get to know her. She was getting prepared to book a ticket home from Saint Lucia depending on his answers.Juan Pablo argued that her \"no kissing rule\" earlier in the season in South Korea was the best thing he ever heard, however, he jokingly said she went back on her word and that wasn't his fault. Juan Pablo tried to convince her that he could see himself with her and it was more than just a physical attraction.\"Do you think you know me well enough to make a decision?\" Clare asked him.\"That's a good question because a proposal for me and my daughter is huge, and I've been thinking for a week already. 'Am I ready?' is my question. 'Do I know the person as much as I know I would love to know somebody?'\" Juan Pablo explained.Clare told him that's what she wanted to hear. She wanted to hear more than, \"I like kissing you, I like kissing you.\" Juan Pablo said he wanted her there and she was \"special\" to him. He could see them having a baby or two within a couple months if they ended up together, and he assured her that he \"honestly\" felt great with her. Clare was convinced at that point they had \"a lot more\" going on than she feared.Juan Pablo talked to Clare about what things may be like four months down the road and how they'd deal with being apart while the show aired. Clare seemed to take that as a sure sign he'd pick her in the end.\"We had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one. I just know it and I feel really good about that. I like that girl a lot,\" Juan Pablo said in a confessional.\"I don't want a rose, I want forever,\" Clare said.The next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his one-on-one date with Nikki. He knew that Nikki was in love with him, but he needed to figure out his own feelings. Nikki loved him so much but admitted the one thing missing from her fairytale was hearing how Juan Pablo felt about her in return, as she believed he was a \"cautious\" man who was afraid to get hurt.Nikki then confronted Juan Pablo about how she believed he might be \"a little guarded\" and maybe \"scared to open up.\" star immediately rejected that notion.\"When I feel it, I will open up. So, I'm not, I'm not guarded,\" Juan Pablo told her.Nikki was a little worried about whether Juan Pablo loved her, yet he made her feel very comfortable. She didn't see him having their type of connection with anyone else. Nikki said she'd be \"heartbroken\" if that day was her last day ever with Juan Pablo, but she was trying not to stress it.When she asked what life would be like after all their fancy dates were over, Juan Pablo said there would be a lot of TV watching -- such as sports -- and he'd do that alone often times. Nikki didn't seem overly alarmed by that statement.That night, the couple talked some more and she needed to hear him say, \"I love you.\" The pair acknowledged how their journey was almost over and Nikki told him the idea of that was a little scary because she was \"head over heels in love with him.\"\"I don't think I've ever been with someone whom I felt so right with. I'm in love with this guy and I want forever with him,\" Nikki said in a confessional.Nikki then gave Juan Pablo a heartfelt, emotional card that he read aloud, once again expressing her love and admiration for him. In response, Juan Pablo kissed her multiple times yet said nothing, and she seemed very sad and unsatisfied. When he left, she broke down into tears on the couch.When it became time for the season's final Rose Ceremony, both women felt confident they'd end up as Juan Pablo's fiancee. They were looking forward to starting a life with him and ending their fairytales on a high note. Clare was picturing a ring on her left hand, while Nikki noted, \"I know it's me. He can't have what he has with me with anyone else.\"Clare was the first woman to meet Chris Harrison on a private beach, and host walked her towards Juan Pablo. She said it was a very nerve-wracking moment and she had poured her heart and soul into the process.Clare trusted Juan Pablo and knew everything was going to be okay, because he had always promised her that. Clare acknowledged her deceased father would be very proud of her for opening up, and she didn't think Juan Pablo had any doubts about their relationship when examining their last conversation.Juan Pablo had little to say at first, so Clare expressed how -- despite all her previous questions and concerns -- she believed in Juan Pablo and knew they had something special.After telling Clare they had some ups and downs, fixed their issues, and she was still there because he wanted her there, Juan Pablo broke the bad news.\"You are unbelievable, such an amazing woman. Um, I wish the earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever. I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along, and I've been very honest since the beginning to everybody that, at some point, some people are going to go home. I have to follow what I think is best for me, and I have to say goodbye to you,\" Juan Pablo told Clare.Juan Pablo tried to wrap his arms around Clare and embrace her, but she coldly rejected the gesture.\"This entire time, I stuck around because I believed in you. The other night on our last date, when we spent our last hour together, I needed that reassurance, and I gave you that opportunity right then because I've been scared to death. And for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento, that you can see yourself if we got together and had our babies -- I wanted to do it because I believed in us. I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you are,\" Clare calmly said with tears in her eyes.Juan Pablo tried to interrupt her, but Clare snapped, \"I'm not done.\"\"And [ Sharleen Joynt ] didn't have the feelings for you. It wasn't there. [ Andi Dorfman ] did the same thing. You had every opportunity, like those other girls did, to tell me exactly how you felt,\" she explained.\"Do you know how I feel? Do you know when I made my decision?\" Juan Pablo asked the bachelorette.\"It doesn't matter to me,\" Clare said as she walked away. \"I lost respect for you, because I'll tell you what, I thought I knew what kind of man you are. What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,\" Clare said.Juan Pablo just kept repeating \"okay\" throughout her speech as if he didn't really care about anything she was saying.\"Oof, I'm glad I didn't pick her,\" Juan Pablo said after she left. \"Oof.\"In her final words, Clare repeated some of the statements she had already made to Juan Pablo. She truly had faith in him and so it was very disappointing. She never ran even when she wanted to and felt weak.\"It's easy to just kiss and show your feelings. But don't tell me you 'love f-cking me.' Don't tell me that,\" Clare told the cameras.\"That, to me, is not a man... Don't tell me how much your family loved me. Just don't say anything. Don't say anything. I know it's about following your heart. I know it's about standing up for what you want... But right now, it just hurts my heart. Where is the man that makes me feel like I'm worth it, the man who would fight for me? Where is that man who would fight for me?\"Juan Pablo, according to Chris Harrison , had picked out a \"beautiful engagement ring\" for Nikki.Afterward, Chris walked Nikki to Juan Pablo once she arrived at the quiet beach. She wondered whether the day might not go as she had planned, but she knew there was a great chance she'd end up engaged and she really wanted that.Nikki couldn't imagine what Juan Pablo was going through and couldn't wait to hear everything she had been waiting for him to say. Nikki wanted to hear that he loved her and she was anticipating it would be the best day of her life.Once they were face to face, Nikki thanked Juan Pablo for everything and said their experience had been amazing and he was an amazing person. She said she wanted to be a part of his family and his life. Nikki noted she never felt that way before about anyone and she didn't expect to feel that way, but she was glad she did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.\"I can't imagine spending my life without you. I don't want it to stop and I don't think it will. I love you,\" Nikki told Juan Pablo.Juan Pablo had tears in his eyes and took a deep breath. He told Nikki that he loved so many things about her -- how she cared about other people, her honesty, her ability to be a good stepmom to Camila, and how every time with her was a perfect time.However, Juan Pablo reiterated how her father had demanded he only propose if he was completely 100 percent sure of Nikki and the decision he was making. It then became very apparent that Juan Pablo was not certain he wanted to be engaged to his final bachelorette. That's when he gave Nikki his final rose.During : After the Final Rose special, Clare admitted to Chris Harrison she had been wearing \"rose-colored glasses\" and she \"should've left\" because her \"gut was right on.\"Clare explained her heart was open and her guard was down, which is why she didn't leave him. She thought he was serious about marriage but got the closure she needed by unloading on Juan Pablo the day of the finale. Clare didn't care to see him again in person because she didn't want to be fed anymore \"B-S.\"Juan Pablo then sat in the hotseat and told Chris he did what he felt was right for him and things worked out the way they were supposed to.

Not going to lie, I'm okay moving on,\" Chris said later on.The special concluded with Chris confirming Andi is the next ette star. She's \"speechless\" about the opportunity and definitely \"looking to find that great love.\"\"If you fall in love, don't be afraid to say that,\" Chris told Andi in a sarcastic tone, clearly taking a shot at Juan Pablo.

Did he propose?\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nGalavis ended up picking Nikki over Clare but did NOT propose to her. Check out 5 highlights from the two-hour episode (also check out PHOTOS).\n\n1. The women meet Juan Pablo's family\n\nThe finale was set in beautiful St. Lucia, the scene of a past episode. Clare and Nikki each got a chance to meet Galavis' parents and cousin Rodolfo. The women seem enamored by watching Galavis interact with his daughter. Clare gushes to his family about how she can't wait to be a mother and wants four children.\n\n\"I could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo's family forever,\" she later says.\n\nAs for Nikki, she says she's nervous because she knows Galavis' family is really important to him. She had met his parents and daughter in a previous episode.\n\nNikki rattles off all the places they've visited during the season. Galavis' daughter seems bored.\n\nGalavis loves to talk about how honest he is. Honestly must run in his family -- key words Galavis' mother used to describe him include \"hyperactive -- super hyperactive\" and sometimes \"very rude.\"\n\n\"He's not an easy guy,\" Galavis' dad says about his son, while speaking to Nikki. \"I'm telling you because he's vocalized in what he wants. He's always very specific in what he wants. He thinks he [knows] the truth in everything.\"\n\n\"Juan Pablo ... I mean I love the guy -- he's a really great guy -- but sometimes, when things are getting rough, he'll walk away from the relationship,\" Rodolfo tells Nikki.\n\nI feel like we would fight well together,\" Nikki jokes.\n\n2. WHAT did Juan Pablo Galavis tell Clare?\n\nGalavis goes on a final date with each of the contestants. Clare says that during theirs, while they were in a helicopter, he told her something off-camera \"that no woman wants to hear.\"\n\n\"[He said] that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing I don't even want to repeat,\" she said. \"It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.\"\n\n\"I'm not just an object,\" she added. \"Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"\n\nClare, who, by the way, is the contestant Galavis famously frolicked with in the ocean during a past date (nothing more than PG-13 was shown on TV), later confronts Galavis about it. They start a very serious conversation, during which he stroked her leg, and she tells him she wants their relationship to be more than just physical. He tells her they have more than just a physical attraction. \"I like what I have seen during the entire adventure,\" he says.\n\n\"'Am I ready?' is my question,\" Galavis said. \"'Do I know the person?'\"\n\nClare's anger over his past offensive remarks appears to melt away. She is already daydreaming about that ring. (Heck, she's practically daydreaming about hanging out at the jewelry store, picking out bridal necklaces, after dropping off the ring to be resized because that's what happens a LOT when men pick out rings.)\n\n\"That's what I want to hear,\" she says. \"That's the kind of stuff I want to hear. I wanna hear about more than like, 'I like kissing you, I like kissing you.' I know it gets tough after this. I know it's gonna be hard after this. If I am gonna be with somebody, I want them to know that they want to be with me.\"\n\nGot all that? Who said relationships are complicated?\n\n3. Love letter\n\nNikki, by contrast, seems far less dramatic than Clare, and a lot more pensive and possibly naive.\n\n\"I'm in love with this guy,\" she says. \"I want forever with him.\"\n\nHe reads a mushy handwritten letter she wrote to him (flashback: \"The Babysitter's Club,\" Kristy), makes out with her a bit more and then leaves. She sits on a coach, crying.\n\nFYI to single women: Alpha-males LOVE love letters.*\n\n4. Clare finally stands up for herself because ...\n\nSeriously, Clare is so over the mysterious offensive comment and is ready to get engaged. Babies. She's probably ready for babies. She stands in front of Galavis in a one-shoulder teal gown on a beach, holding his hand, waiting.\n\n\"I wish ... I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,\" he says. \"... I have to say goodbye to you.\"\n\nUh oh.\n\nThen she lets him have it.\n\n\"I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you and I thought I knew what kind of man you were,\" she says.\n\nGalavis graciously offers to tell her the precise moment he decided not to choose her. She finally stands up for herself and declines.\n\n\"Doesn't matter to me,\" she says. \"I lost respect for you. I'll tell you what. I thought I knew what kind of man you were. What you just made me go though ... I would never want my children having a father like you.\"\n\nAfter she walks away, Galavis says: \"Whew. I'm glad I didn't pick her.\"\n\n5. Thanks DAD!!!\n\nHost Chris Harrison, who is standing in front of a live studio audience partially populated by former \"Bachelor\" and \"Bachelorette\" couples as well as current eliminated contestants, reveals that Galavis DID pick out a diamond engagement ring. It was designed by Neil Lane, which follows \"Bachelor\" and \"Bachelorette\" tradition. Will Nikki get it?\n\nDressed in a cobalt blue gown with a thigh-high slit, she walks up to Galavis.\n\n\"I can't wait to tell my mom, like, 'Mom, I'm engaged,\" she is heard narrating.\n\nTo Galavis, she says he is an amazing person and that she has waited a long time for this \"once-of-a-lifetime\" moment and that she cannot imagine spending her life without him.\n\n\"I love you,\" she says.\n\n\"Whew,\" he says. \"Just know that I love so many things about you.\"\n\nUh oh.\n\nGalavis told her that when her father told him (in a previous episode) that he should only propose to Nikki if he was absolutely sure about it, that made him \"think a lot.\"\n\n\"And honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not gonna use it,\" Galavis says, twisting the knife he just stabbed in Nikki's heart. 'Uh uh. I'm not 100 percent sure that I wanna propose to you. At the same time, I'm 100 percent sure that I just don't wanna let you go.\"\n\nThen, the final blow.\n\n\"I like you a lot,\" he continues. \"A lot.\"\n\nAnd he gives her a consolation prize -- hint -- she's got a collection of them.\n\nGalavis gave Nikki a rose.\n\n\"Nikki will you accept my final rose?\" he asks.\n\nShe nods. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nIgnoring the naked, chilly feeling on her ring finger, she makes out with him a bit while clutching the rose. Think she'll keep it in a flower press with the words \"Worst consolation prize ever\" scrawled on it?\n\n\"The Bachelor: After The Final Rose\"\n\nClare declined invitation to confront Juan Pablo Galavis\n\n\n\nDuring the live \"After The Final Rose\" segment, which aired after the finale, Harrison offered Clare the chance to confront Galavis about his rejection of her, in front of the eager studio audience.\n\n\n\n\"Looking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before and I think so many women can relate to that, where you want to have hope, you give it chance after chance,\" she says.\n\n\n\nClare says that moment gave her closure.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more B.S.,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThat's too bad, because it would have made for entertaining TV, Clare.\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis talks about rejecting Clare\n\n\n\n\"To me, it was very hard to say to people and honestly, at the end of the day, I made the decision that I thought was good for me,\" he says. \"It is what it is.\" Regarding Clare, he says: \"We had rollercoasters and we lived through out and it worked out the way it worked out.\"\n\n\n\nHe refused to reveal what he told Clare during their date, which she found offensive.\n\n\n\n\"People have private conversations,\" he says. \"From my mouth, nothing is gonna come out. It's something that is personal.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have nothing bad to talk about Clare,\" he adds. \"She was great -- she was there for a reason.\"\n\nNikki: He hasn't said 'I love you' (RUN! RUN AWAY!)\n\n\n\n\"We've been really happy,\" she tells Harrison, cheerfully. \"It's been great.\"\n\n\n\n\"Has he told you he loves you?\" he asks.\n\n\n\n\"Not exactly,\" she replies. \"I know that he does. I've never told someone I love them first so it's been a struggle. If he wasn't invested in this relationship and making this work, he wouldn't be with me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not gonna force it,\" she adds. \"It's on his time and I'm happy in a relationship and I know he is too, so I feel like that should matter more than anything.\"\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis humiliates his non-fiancee on national television\n\n\n\nGalavis then joins her on the couch. Harrison asks them how they are doing.\n\n\n\n\"I think we're doing great,\" he says.\n\n\n\nI feel fantastic about this woman,\" he adds, saying that it's time for them to continue their private relationship.\n\n\n\n\"Chris I feel great, like I said,\" he says. \"So I'm very honest to her and I keep things to ourselves and I show her how I feel about her and she's happy with that.\"\n\n\n\nNikki remains silent, smiling politely as Galavis drones on about how it's been \"tough\" and then scolds Harrison for interrupting him earlier in the show.\n\n\n\nSean Lowe, the star of season 17 of \"The Bachelor\" who recently wed Catherine Giudici, who won, offers his opinion on the whole situation.\n\n\n\n\"When I'm in love, I want that person to know it,\" he says (brags?), adding: \"To each their own.\"\n\nHow long is Nikki going to remain in a relationship with Juan Pablo Galavis?\n\n\n\nWhen asked this by Harrison, Nikki replies: \"As long as it feels right, I'll give it that length of time. Once it doesn't feel right, I think I' m gonna be out. But it feels right.\" \"We have plans,\" Galavis adds. \"Now we're gonna figure it out in our private life.\"\n\nAs he has said many times: Ay-ay-ay.\n\nAlso on \"The Bachelor: After The Final Rose,\" the new star of the upcoming season of \"The Bachelorette\" was revealed.

Vote in our poll, below.", "119": "Nikki Ferrell, pediatric nurse from Kansas City's Children's Mercy Hospital, won the final rose on ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" but didn't get a ring or even an \"I love you\" from star Juan Pablo Galavis.\n\nFerrell outplayed a cast of other women on the long-running reality show, competing for the heart of Galavis. He chose Ferrell over rival finalist Clare Crawley, who had strong words for him after being rejected in the final rose ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the reunion show after the telecast, Ferrell said she was relieved that the show was over. She said she's still in a relationship with Galavis, something they've struggled to keep secret.\n\nShe also revealed that while she loves him, he's never told her that he loves her back. He also declined a multiple opportunities to tell Nikki that he loved her during the reunion show.\n\nFerrell said that Juan Pablo's actions speak louder than words.\n\n\"If he wasn't invested in the relationship, he wouldn't be with me,\" she said.\n\nDuring their home visit to Kansas City, Galavis and Ferrell visited Oklahoma Joe's BBQ and a bar at Kansas City's Power and Light District.\n\nFerrell and Galavis didn't reveal what their next plans were or whether they planned to continue to live in separate cities. Galavis said he wanted to keep the future details of their relationship private.\n\nFerrell's friends gathered at a home in Westwood, Kan., to watch the finale.\n\n\"It's very strange,\" said friend Carol McGinness. \"At the beginning of this before she went, a group of got together and gave her some advice and just kind of celebrated this journey she was going on, and so finally getting to the end and being able to have open conversations with her and talk about it and be excited with her in a whole different way is really exciting.\"\n\nAlertMe", "120": "It's no secret there's been a ton of negativity surrounding this season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d But while fans, celebrity and otherwise, have shared their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo, it's also been one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history. Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?\n\n\n\nWhen host Chris Harrison announced on The Bachelorette\u2019s \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice.\n\nUnlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.\n\n\n\n\"You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time,\" Harrison tells TVGuide.com\n\n\n\nHeading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its \"Juan-uary\" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a three-year ratings high for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo infamously said in an interview that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were \"more pervert.\" The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo posted an apology, but the dust never really settled.\n\n\n\nA couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's late-night swim with Clare, which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer Sharleen exited just before hometown dates saying, \"There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me.\"\n\n\n\nDuring fantasy suite week, Andi also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show.\n\n\n\n\"I've done more interviews \u2014 random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times \u2014 about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera,\" Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the \"Women Tell All\" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star.\n\n\n\nBut has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star Sean Lowe, who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant Catherine on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of Ben Flajnik\u2019s Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of \u201cThe Voice\u201d are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.)\n\nSo, is Juan Pablo truly a \"bad\" Bachelor? \"I don't know how you answer that,\" Harrison says. \"Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.\n\n\n\n\"We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion,\" Harrison continues. \"Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. \"We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera,\" Harrison says. \"We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was.\"\n\n\n\nSo, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? \"I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor,\" Harrison says. \"It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next.\"\n\n\n\nThe Bachelor's three-hour finale airs on Monday at 8/7c on ABC.", "121": "It\u2019s time for the final rose!

The Bachelor spoilers have long indicated that Juan Pablo doesn't ask his final female to marry him, and even more spoilers than that indicate that Juan Pablo and his lady haven't even survived through the After the Final Rose ceremony.\n\nAre the spoilers correct? Let's watch The Bachelor finale and find out...\n\nChris Harrison enters the live studio full of people eager to watch The Bachelor finale live. He calls it \"one of the most dramatic and surprising\" finales ever. Just like every other finale. Minus 5.\n\n\"The controversy around Juan Pablo is unlike anything we've ever seen before.\" Oh, REEEEEAAAALLLLLY, Chris Harrison. Really.\n\nJuan Pablo's entire family has been flown to St. Lucia where Nikki and Clare will meet them all. His sister even flew in from Venezuela.\n\nClare's going to meet the parents first. Juan Pablo says his physical attraction to Clare is \"on fire.\" Vomit. Minus 2.\n\nThe only redeeming thing about Juan Pablo at this point is his relationship with his daughter. The only thing.\n\nHis family finds out that Clare's mother is Mexican and everyone in her family speaks Spanish except for her. She loses points in their eyes with that. She totally does.\n\nJuan Pablo's mom sits down with Clare and Clare tells the Mama that she feels love for Juan Pablo. Then Mama says \"ask me anything\" like she's on Reddit.\n\nClare asks about his personality and Mama says he's hyperactive. That's...not personality? Minus 2.\n\nOhhh, there we go.\n\n\"He sometimes is very rude.\" TRUE STORY, MAMA. True story. Clare is EXCITED to learn that she's been RIGHT about him being RUDE. What kind of bizarro world does this woman live in?\n\nRodolfo, the cousin with the braces, says that sometimes Juan Pablo walks away in relationships when things get rough. Can Clare keep holding on if Juan Pablo is walking away?\n\nRodolfo and Juan Pablo chat and Rodolfo tells Juan Pablo that Clare is basically \"begging\" for an engagement and babies.\n\nAwww, Juan Pablo's dad tells Clare that he would love any children she brought to their family and that if Juan Pablo chooses her, she'll have a dad. It's pretty sweet. Plus 10.\n\nChris reminds us that this will be the most controversial finale in history and then asks how many people think Juan Pablo chooses Clare. About 5 people cheer.\n\nAnd now it's Nikki's turn to meet Juan Pablo's family again.\n\nThere he goes with Camila and his niece again! It's adorable! Why didn't ABC just give him a show hanging out with his daughter?? Plus 8.\n\nNikki's nervous to meet Juan Pablo's family again because this time she'll be hanging out with them.\n\nPapa talks to Nikki first and she says that Camila has made Juan Pablo who he is today. She wants a relationship with both Juan Pablo and Camila and Papa says it won't be easy. Juan Pablo isn't an easy guy. He's \"focalized\" on what he wants.\n\n\"He think he knew the truth of everything.\" Papa gets more points for speaking the REAL truth. Plus 12.\n\nIn her conversation with Mama, Nikki says \"love\" approximately 8 times in 2 minutes. Mama tells Nikki that Juan Pablo is a simple guy, happy to stay home and watch TV on the weekends.\n\nNikki talks to Rodolfo and tells him that she's in love with Juan Pablo. He's asking the tough questions, which explains why he's here. He wants to know, again, how Nikki would deal with Juan Pablo walking away or fighting.\n\n\"I think we would fight well,\" she says.\n\nIt's time for the final dates before Juan Pablo makes his decision. He doesn't know what he's going to do, so he starts by taking Clare on a date.\n\nShe comes running across a field toward him and they take a helicopter ride to see St. Lucia from the air. Or they would do that if they could ever stop kissing.\n\nShe's \"on cloud 9.\" BAAARF. Minus 10. Juan Pablo says she's \"sexy, she's cute, she kisses...hot...aye aye aye...\" Baaaaaarrrrrf. Minus 12.\n\nAs the helicopter is landing, Juan Pablo leans over with no cameras or other people around and whispers in Clare's ear something that she says \"no woman wants to hear.\"\n\nHe says that he really doesn't know her and then says something \"sexual\" that she \"really doesn't even want to repeat.\" It's offensive and insulting and she's \"not just an object.\"\n\nHe said \"I feel like we don't know each other.\" And that he loved hooking up with her, but not in those words. She won't repeat the words he used.\n\nShe won't kiss him when he walks into her apartment and instead just asks him to sit. Plus 7\n\nShe's so awkward when she says \"I want to talk to you\" like she's trying to smile and NOT be mad when she apparently really should be mad. It's weird.\n\nHe says that he didn't mean \"I don't know you at all.\" What he MEANT was that he doesn't know her enough. He doesn't know either of them enough.\n\nHe says there are parts of her he likes and probably parts of her he doesn't like because he doesn't know those parts yet. She doesn't take that well, but he kind of has a point. He turns the tables and says there are probably lots of things she doesn't know about him and won't like either.\n\nClare's ready to walk if Juan Pablo is only in it with her for their chemistry.\n\nHe tells her that the best thing she ever did was instill the \"no kissing\" rule that lasted from Los Angeles to South Korea, so approximately one week. Minus 3.\n\nJuan Pablo lists the things he does like about Clare and then tells her he has spent a week thinking about whether or not he can actually propose to either of them because it's about more than just him.\n\nHe smooth talks his way back into her heart. She goes ahead and talks about marriage. Minus 15.\n\nNow it's time for Nikki's final date. Will Juan Pablo whisper sweet inappropriate nothings in her ear?\n\nShe walks up in a bikini ready to hop on a boat with Juan Pablo for the day. She's looking for openness and sharing and probably isn't going to get it. She'll get \"honesty\" though.\n\nNikki tells Juan Pablo that he's guarded and he says \"no, I'm not guarded.\" Minus 8. No one would blame him if he was.\n\n\"What's going to happen when you don't have private islands anymore,\" Nikki asks. \"I'll have a bed and a TV,\" he replies. Oh, okay then.\n\nShe really, really wants him to tell her that he loves her. Until he tells her he loves her, she won't be able to settle down for this date. He doesn't do much to reassure her other than telling her it's going to be okay. But she \"wants forever with him.\"\n\nShe gives him a picture of the two of them and a sweet, heartfelt letter. He kisses her on the forehead and then says he'll see her tomorrow.\n\nOUCH. Minus 18.\n\nAfter he leaves she sits down on her couch and has a good cry.\n\nThe day has come when Juan Pablo has to make his final choice. The girls are getting dressed in their finest and Juan Pablo looks dapper in a navy suit.\n\nOh, look. Posed shots of the women on balconies looking out over the ocean! Minus 2.\n\nBoth women are certain Juan Pablo is going to propose to them. Clare closes her eyes as she rides on a boat and gets her perfectly curled hair completely windblown.\n\n\"It has to be me!\" they both say! But it can only be one of them.\n\nClare gets off her boat first and Chris Harrison escorts her to see Juan Pablo. She says there were times she wanted to bolt and times that scared her to death. But she's standing there right now because they have something special and she believes in him.\n\nJuan Pablo remembers the first time he saw Clare, when she got out of the limo with the fake belly and says she's there because he wanted her to be there. She's \"unbelievable...such an amazing woman.\"\n\nThen he says \"I wish the earth sucked me today.\" (Not gonna lie. I laughed at that.)\n\nHe sends her home as gently as he can and goes in for a hug but she puts her hands up and stops him. She tells him that she gave him an out two nights ago and he didn't take it.\n\n\"You had every opportunity to tell me how you feel,\" she says. \"Do you know how I feel?\" he replies. \"Do you know when I made my decision?\"\n\n\"I don't care.\" And then she says she'd never want a man like him to be the father of her children and walks away.\n\n\"I'm glad I didn't pick her\" he says, after she's out of earshot. OMG! Minus 75. (But we're all glad you didn't pick her, too.)\n\nNow Juan Pablo waits for Nikki with his Neil Lane diamond engagement ring. (It's gorgeous.) She treks across the sand in her high heels and Chris Harrison escorts her in.\n\nShe's excited for the possibility that she's getting engaged, last night's tears a distant memory.\n\nNikki starts by thanking him for the experiences, but she should really be thanking ABC. She wants him to be a part of her life and wants to be a part of his. Nikki can't imagine spending her life without him.\n\n\"Nikki, I love so many things about you...\" NOT THE SAME, JUAN PABLO. Minus 25\n\nHe recalls a conversation with her dad and says he isn't 100% sure that he wants to propose but he is 100% sure that he doesn't want to let her go.\n\nHe gives her a rose instead of a ring.\n\nThat's a respectable move coming from just about anyone other than Juan Pablo.\n\nAnd now it's time for the After the Final Rose live chat.\n\n\"Why was 'I like you a lot' enough for Nikki,\" Chris Harrison asks. Hopefully we'll find out at some point in the next hour.\n\nFirst we have to talk to Clare. Watching everything back for the first time was hard and brought back the sting of the day Juan Pablo sent her home.\n\nClare is a compulsive lip-licker and I would really like to hand her a tube of Chapstick while also knowing what lipstick she's wearing that it doesn't wipe off with all the lip-licking she does when she's nervous. minus 2\n\nShe admits she should have left after he offended her in the helicopter in St. Lucia but she trusted that this was the real deal.\n\nChris asks if she'd like to confront Juan Pablo and she talks about how laying all of her emotions on the line when she left in St. Lucia was all the closure she needed. She doesn't want to sit on the couch and get fed \"anymore BS.\" Plus 48.\n\nKelly leans over to whisper something to Sharleen. What did she say!?!?\n\nJuan Pablo finally makes his way out and Chris asks him about Clare. He just says he made the decision he had to make for himself.\n\nChris asks him if he has any regrets about the way things went down on the show and Juan Pablo starts rambling on about how many hours he spent on the show for it to be boiled down to 20 hours of programming and he enjoyed getting to know the women.\n\nChris tries to steer him back to the topic and Juan Pablo goes \"can I talk?\"\n\nMy eyes just did this: O_O\n\nWhen Chris asks him about the helicopter, Juan Pablo says he won't say anything bad about Clare and that what happened in the helicopter stays in the helicopter. He also doesn't know why he should have any regrets.\n\nJuan Pablo leaves the stage and Nikki comes out to sit with Chris. Her hair is looking great. Apparently she and Juan Pablo are still dating and she's still in love with him. But she still doesn't know if he's in love with her. Minus 10.\n\nShe's not going to force him to say \"I love you.\" According to her, they're both happy in their relationship.\n\nJuan Pablo joins Nikki on the stage and she immediately cozies up to him. They've kept their relationship secret for 4 months and now they can go out in public.\n\nChris asks Juan Pablo if he has a big surprise for the night and Juan Pablo says that he doesn't. He talked to the executives and no, he doesn't have any surprises.\n\nChris presses him about the love issue and says she told the world she loves Juan Pablo but he won't say it back. And he won't. He refuses to publicly profess his love.\n\nI can't decide if I like that he won't buckle to Chris Harrison's pressure or don't like it.\n\nSean gives him the side-eye.\n\nJuan Pablo is heated. HEATED. He keeps getting interrupted and doesn't like it and keeps shutting Chris down. There might be flames bursting out of both of their ears right now.\n\nChris asks Sean to speak about his experience. Sean was okay giving up his privacy in a way that Juan Pablo isn't comfortable. Sean couldn't wait to tell Catherine he loved her, but acknowledges that different people work in different ways. Plus 2? I think?\n\nChris is just hung up on being able to say that Nikki and Juan Pablo are in love. Nikki says this is a real relationship and they're taking it very seriously. Juan Pablo says time will tell for the two of them.\n\nFinally, they acknowledge that the end result is what matters and they're happy. Two weeks ago their plans changed so now they're starting their future together in a public relationship. Chris keeps pressing Juan Pablo on what the plans are but Juan Pablo won't tell him. Minus 4\n\nCatherine says this show is about love and tells Juan Pablo not to slap the hand that fed him. Chris tries to host-splain it to Juan Pablo and again pushes the love issue. He says he'd never seen the show before and Sharleen leans over to whisper into Kat's ear.\n\nChris congratulates them and then tells us it's time to meet the new Bachelorette.\n\nANDI DORFMAN!\n\nShe believes she's going to find the love of her life on a reality dating show! Minus 12.\n\nChris makes fun of Juan Pablo by asking Andi if she knows this is going to be on television and giving her a pass to express her emotions on this journey.\n\nAnd with that another season of The Bachelor is done!

And starting a relationship, beginning today! One in which he still won't say I love you!\n\nHe is kind of a dick to Chris but eeees okay, he's \"honest with people.\"\n\nJust leave them alone, people. This is PRIVATE. And very awkward.\n\nBasically Clare, Andi and Sharleen - 3 of his top 6 - hate this clown.\n\nEven Juan Pablo's parents don't even seem to like him that much.\n\nAs for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, that we will have to wait beyond the standard After the Final Rose special filler to truly find out.\n\nThey have no plans, really, to do anything. But stay tuned.\n\nIt's been rumored that Galavis was \"hurt\" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and \"doesn't necessarily find his soul mate\" with Clare or Nikki.\n\nIt's also rumored that Juan Pablo went on the show as a giant self-promotional campaign but never had any real engagement or marriage aspirations.\n\nThink that's true, based on what we just saw play out tonight? Did he lead them on this whole time? Or was he just not feeling these final two? What do you think?\n\nAlso, Andi Dorfman is your new Bachelorette.

LOLOLOLOLOL View Poll \u00bb\n\nJuan Pablo: The worst Bachelor ever?", "124": "It has been an explosive and dramatic season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Juan Pablo narrowed it down to two women \u2013 Nikki and Clare \u2013 but on Monday only one will remain. Who will Juan Pablo choose to be with? Will Juan Pablo propose? And did he truly come on the show to find love?\n\nMeet The Parents\n\nThe season finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d kicked off in St. Lucia with Clare meeting Juan Pablo\u2019s family for the first time \u2026 and it set off a couple of red flags. At the beginning of their meeting things seemed to be going smoothly with Clare talking about kids and how she can\u2019t wait to be a mother. But it went south when Juan Pablo\u2019s mother told Clare that her son often comes off as rude when he\u2019s being \u201chonest.\u201d\n\nClare brushed off the warning and told his mother that she\u2019s \u201cdefinitely falling in love with him.\u201d But Juan Pablo\u2019s cousin, Rodolfo, also seemed to be hinting that there could be trouble for the pair down the line.\n\nAfter Clare met Juan Pablo\u2019s family it was Nikki\u2019s turn. Nikki initially met Juan Pablo\u2019s parents and his daughter Camila while in Miami, but their meeting was brief and no one had the opportunity to really grill each other. But just like Clare\u2019s meeting, Juan Pablo\u2019s family seemed to only have warnings for Nikki.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an easy guy,\u201d Juan Pablo\u2019s dad tried telling Nikki. \u201cIt\u2019s always very specific in what he wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy you want?\u201d his mom asked her. And when Nikki said yes and asked if Juan Pablo was ready for all of this, all his mother could reply was that she was \u201cpretty sure.\u201d\n\nClare\u2019s Final Date\n\nClare has one final date with Juan Pablo before the rose ceremony and she\u2019s ready to make it count. But events occur that leave her struggling with what to do next.\n\nGoing on a helicopter ride over the ocean, Juan Pablo and Clare are able to have a rare moment together without any cameras or microphones. And while Clare was hoping that he would use that time to whisper some \u201csweet, kind and loving words,\u201d the exact opposite allegedly came out.\n\n\u201cIt was just something that he said in that moment to me,\u201d Clare explained to the cameras after the fact. \u201cI almost don\u2019t have words for it, how I feel right now. He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he really doesn\u2019t know me, and some sexual thing I don\u2019t want to repeat. It was insulting, offensive and it just made me feel awful.\u201d\n\nClare continued that although she can\u2019t repeat it, Juan Pablo said something along the lines of that he didn\u2019t really know her but loved hooking up with her. His offensive comments left her wondering if all they had was a physical relationship, and desperate for answers before she could move any further.\n\nLater that night Clare had the opportunity to explain how she felt to Juan Pablo, and ask him how he truly feels. And while Juan Pablo beat around the bush, he did tell Clare that she\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d to him and that he feels \u201cgreat\u201d about her.\n\nClare drank the punch he was spewing and somehow got out of their conversation that there is more than just a physical attraction between them. \u201cTonight I know that he wants me here,\u201d she told the cameras.\n\nNikki\u2019s Final Date\n\nFor his final date with Nikki, Juan Pablo takes the pediatric nurse on a private yacht for some fun in the sun. Showing up in a bikini, Nikki is set on having Juan Pablo confess his feelings to her. But when Juan Pablo asks if she has any concerns, she doesn\u2019t bring it up.\n\nAfter their romantic date, Juan Pablo visits her at the room. And once again Nikki is desperate to hear that he loves her. But those words never come \u2013 even when Nikki gives him a photo and letter. In the letter Nikki thanks him for the once in a lifetime experience, telling him that she can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings them and that she loves him. And all Juan Pablo can do is thank her and kiss her cheek and forehead before leaving \u2026 leading her to cry after he closes the door.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s Decision With Clare\n\nThe camera shows a ring in Juan Pablo\u2019s hand \u2026 but will he use it? First up is Clare. Arriving by boat, \u201cBachelor\u201d host Chris Harrison walks her in to see Juan Pablo for the final time.\n\nJuan Pablo tells her that since he first saw her \u2013 with the fake belly \u2013 they have had their ups and downs. \u201cYou\u2019re here because I wanted you to be here,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou are unbelievable, such an amazing woman \u2026 I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along.\u201d\n\nHOWEVER, Juan Pablo says that he has to follow what he thinks is best for him. \u201cI will have to say goodbye,\u201d he tells her, going in to hug her. But Clare throws her hands up to put the kibosh on the hug.\n\n\u201cThis entire time I stuck around because I believed in you,\u201d she tells him angrily. \u201cAnd the other night on our last date when you came over and we spent our last hour together. I needed that reassurance and I gave you the opportunity right then\u2026 and for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento.\u201d\n\nJuan Pablo asks if she wants to know why he made his decision, but Clare tells him that it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cI lost respect for you,\u201d she says while walking away. \u201cI would never want my children having a father like you.\u201d\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Juan Pablo says, \u201cOof, glad I didn\u2019t pick her\u201d after she left.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s Decision With Nikki\n\nJuan Pablo has a ring in his hand as Nikki arrives on her boat. The 26-year-old believes that there is a good chance she\u2019ll be engaged by the end of the day \u2026 but will Juan Pablo use the ring to propose?\n\n\u201cI want you to be a part of my life,\u201d she tells him. \u201dI\u2019ve never felt like this before and I didn\u2019t expect to feel this way but I\u2019m really glad I do\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine spending my life without you. I don\u2019t want it to stop and I don\u2019t think it will. I love you.\u201d\n\nJuan Pablo responds that there are many things he loves about her and that\u2019s the reason why he wanted her here. \u201cI could see you as a good stepmom to Camila,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have the qualities.\u201d However Juan Pablo drops a bomb on her \u2013 after speaking with her dad during the hometown date, he\u2019s not 100 percent sure that he wants to propose.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I\u2019m not going to use it,\u201d Juan Pablo continues. \u201cI like you a lot, a lot. So Nikki \u2013 will you accept my final rose?\u201d\n\nAnd while Nikki\u2019s face dropped, she ultimately shakes her head yes and embraces him.", "125": "Season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has finally come to an end, and the winner is Nikki Ferrell but the pair did not get engaged. In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn\u2019t 100% sure. But he claimed he was 100% that he didn\u2019t want to let her go, meaning that Nikki uncomfortably accepted JP\u2019s final rose with him stating that he did not love her, but instead \u201cliked her a lot.\u201d In direct comparison so Juan Pablo\u2019s lack of emotions, before receiving the final rose from Juan Pablo, Nikki delved into a tender monologue professing how much she truly adored him and admitted that she does love him. Even though it\u2019s becoming more and more obvious that Juan Pablo did not come to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d to find a wife, and a stepmother to his daughter Camila, Nikki unfortunately did look truly in love. She was nervous and could barely breathe as Juan Pablo revealed that she would not be able to call her mom and say she was engaged because he was not \u201cgoing to use\u201d the enormous diamond engagement ring.\n\nAs for the Clare and Juan Pablo interaction in this finale episode, the most controversial \u201cBachelor\u201d shows once again that he is not to worlds most sensitive of leading men. When Clare arrives on the beach to meet with Juan Pablo, he does actually look nervous. While at first we thought that his nervousness was due to his genuine attraction for Clare, but now we are assuming it was more because he had led her on for too long and he was worried of her reaction. Clare\u2019s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki\u2019s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what\u2019s to come with Juan Pablo. When she first sees him, she speaks first revealing how she trusts him and believes him, but it seems Clare may have put her eggs in the wrong basket because Juan Pablo does not return her sentiments. Juan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it! Clare looks devastated and doesn\u2019t let him hug her as she turns to leave St. Lucia, but not first without telling him she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Juan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, \u201cWhew! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her,\u201d\n\nWe are thinking that Clare really dodged a bullet with this one, because Juan Pablo is really proving himself to be rather heartless. We truly wish Nikki good luck however just from the Final Rose Ceremony and Nikki\u2019s clearly deflated acceptance of the rose; we are assuming that the relationship won\u2019t last. Juan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d", "126": "Chris Harrison may be right \u2013 Monday\u2019s season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis\u2019s roller-coaster ride as the star of The Bachelor was perhaps the most dramatic yet.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s final two women were confident Sacramento-based hairstylist Clare Crawley, who made her strong feelings for Juan Pablo clear from day one, and sweet and sensitive pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell, who wants to be a mom.\n\nSo which woman won Juan Pablo\u2019s heart and the final rose? And is there a newly engaged couple in the Bachelor family?\n\nJuan Pablo sent Clare home angry and gave the final rose to Nikki \u2013 but he didn\u2019t propose to anyone. Here\u2019s how it all went down:\n\nClare was the first to meet Juan Pablo\u2019s family in St. Lucia \u2013 and she earned their approval. His father Saul practically welcomed her to the family, saying, \u201cI love you\u201d in Spanish.\n\n\u201cJuan Pablo definitely has my heart. And now so does his family,\u201d Clare said. \u201cI could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo\u2019s family forever.\u201d\n\nNikki had already met Juan Pablo\u2019s family briefly at his daughter Camila\u2019s dance recital.

But the romance didn\u2019t last long.\n\n\u201cWhat I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. And I was shocked,\u201d Clare said of Juan Pablo\u2019s private whisper when they landed. \u201cHe chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. \u2026 It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.\u201d\n\nLater, Clare confronted Juan Pablo about saying he didn\u2019t know her well.

Clare was understandably heartbroken and shocked. She said Juan Pablo is not the man she thought he was.\n\nShe wished that he hadn't strung her along this entire time if he had known his feelings for her weren't there. Earlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.\n\nAs Wetpaint reports, Clare apparently asked Juan Pablo if he loves her.\n\nHis response? \"I really loved f---ing you.\" Clare even repeated the phrase in her reaction to being dumped. That's pretty low, Juan Pablo.\n\nClare said she doesn't even care about his reasons for not choosing her.

Over the weekend, a reporter for E! asked the actor if he would ever return to the sacred (?) halls of East High \u2014 home of Disney\u2019s High School Musical franchise. And instead of shooting down the rumors, Efron replied, \u201cWe\u2019re all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do\u2026there\u2019s just this look between us.\u201d\n\nRight off the bat, I\u2019ll acknowledge that while this isn\u2019t a \u201cno,\u201d it\u2019s also not confirmation of a reunion. But also: At this point, would a reunion be the worst idea? It\u2019s not exactly surprising that Efron may be in, even though a year or two ago he wanted to graduate from East High for good. (UPDATE: When EW asked Disney Channel for a response to Efron\u2019s comments, they sent this statement: \u201cEveryone at Disney Channel takes pride in knowing that our wonderful \u2018High School Musical\u2019 cast has fond memories about their days as \u2018Wildcats,\u2019 and that each year, new audiences are introduced to the movies through our telecasts around the world, but we have no \u2018new news\u2019 to report.\u201d)\n\nIf Efron did decide to return and give us \u201cScream Pt. 2,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see the rest of the cast following suit. They wouldn\u2019t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV. (And no, I\u2019m not talking about SNL\u2018s High School Musical: New Senior Class.) The movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High. (Real talk: What was Troy and Gabrielle\u2019s love if not a millennial, significantly less high-stakes version of Maria and Tony?) The project keeps getting pushed back, but it hasn\u2019t been canceled \u2014 Disney just put out Teen Beach Movie instead. But what if it got revved up again \u2014 and the original HSM gang came back for a little alumni number? (Efron has long said he would consider doing something like that.)\n\nA return from the original six could give HSM4 enough buzz for the movie to get off the ground. After all, Efron \u2014 while clearly the star of the bunch \u2014 has seen his last couple projects disappoint (RIP, That Awkward Moment). And while he\u2019ll still have no trouble booking future films, it could be in Efron\u2019s best interest to remind people why they love him in the first place.

As we approached the end of the saga of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, tensions ran high. Would they finally solve the mystery of the Yellow King? Was last week\u2019s revelation a confirmation of the killer\u2019s identity, or a red herring? Could it be that the whole thing just one of Rust\u2019s acid traps? And of course, the most important question of all: CARCOSA WTF? Well, the season is over. And now we know everything\u2026or at least, as much as we\u2019ll ever know. SPOILERS FROM HERE:\n\n(UPDATE: Click here for our critic Jeff Jensen\u2019s take on the finale.) Did True Detective have a happy ending? That might sounds like a strange description of an hour of television that prominently featured one of the freakier psychopaths to grace the small screen, the final revelation of Carcosa the Terror Temple, a druggy vision of what appeared to be an Event Horizon wormhole to hell, and both protagonists stabbed with various stabby weapons. But given the season of gloom that preceded it, the season finale of True Detective ended on a note of veritable optimism. \u201cOnce there was only dark,\u201d said Rust Cohle The Nihilist Anti-hero as a closing line/epitaph. \u201cYou ask me, light\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nIt took some time to get there. The boys finally managed to track down Errol Childress the Lawnmower Man. (With a hat tip to Marty: He\u2019s the one who finally connected the whole \u201cgreen-eared spaghetti monster\u201d description to a new coat of green paint on a house from the old Dora Lange case.) That led Rust and Marty out to Errol\u2019s house, which he shared with his aunt/girlfriend and his decaying dead father.\n\nThey chased him into what appeared to be some kind of overgrown ruined temple \u2014 or maybe there was some actual infrastructural use for it, in the days before it became a palace of all manner of satanic terror. \u201cThis is Carcosa,\u201d intoned Errol. Rust had a vision straight out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie of a cosmic event in the darkness\u2026and then Errol attacked. He stabbed Rust, and would have killed him\u2026if Rust hadn\u2019t used his Nihilist Headbutt Super Attack. That gave Marty enough time to shoot Errol a couple times. At which point Errol threw what appeared to be a tomahawk Marty\u2019s chest. Marty barely survived \u2014 but Rust finally put the bad man down, shooting him in the head.\n\nRust looked halfway dead, and Martin not much better. But shockingly, they both survived. Rust seemed disappointed. They hadn\u2019t tracked down every member of the Tuttle family, after all. \u201cWe ain\u2019t gonna get them all,\u201d said Marty. \u201cThat ain\u2019t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.\u201d Rust, despondent, explained that he didn\u2019t think he belonged on this world. When he was near-death, he had a vision \u2014 of his daughter, his father, his dead loved ones. \u201cIt was like I was a part of everything I ever loved,\u201d he said, near tears and then beyond them. Was this whole show about Rust learning to accept his daughter\u2019s death? Learning to be human again? Marty guided him away from the hospital, half-carrying him.\n\nIt was a lot to take in \u2014 an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well.) Check out our TV critic Jeff Jensen\u2019s take on the finale.", "142": "Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in a scene from HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d (Credit: Jim Bridges/HBO)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Alyssa Rosenberg is PostOpinions\u2019s new culture blogger. Her own blog will be launching in the coming days. This post discusses the season finale of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d in extensive detail.\n\nAs the final episode of the first season of HBO\u2019s hit anthology series \u201cTrue Detective\u201d approached this Sunday, the show\u2019s obsessive audience puzzled over what might happen when former detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) caught up to the serial killer they\u2019d been chasing across Louisiana for almost two decades. Would Marty, the genial Louisiana native, turn out to be the killer, hiding his brilliant scheme by playing the dummy to his more philosophically inclined partner? Would Marty and Rust finally learn that the secret they\u2019d repeatedly missed had been obvious all along to the women they routinely abuse and ignore? Or, in keeping with the show\u2019s many references to the Carcosa mythos, a concept shared among horror and fantasy writers for more than a century, would monsters from another world appear on the shores of the Louisiana bayou?\n\nIn an interview before the series finale, series creator Nic Pizzolatto suggested something even weightier than an interlocking literary game. Explaining the stakes that Rust and Marty were facing as they reached the end stage of their quest, Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed\u2019s Kate Aurthur: \u201cI think given the amorphous nature of the evil they\u2019re pursuing, its historical roots in culture and government, they would have to be willing to die to fully pursue their absolute justice.\u201d\n\nSussing out the \u201chistorical roots in culture and government\u201d of sex crimes and the biases that let them go unprosecuted is a fascinating goal for any show to set itself. And it would have been a particularly strong mission statement for \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d The show was shot in Louisiana, and in its early episodes it showed some real signs of interest in what happens to the working poor when they become disabled by accidents or exposed to the compounds produced in the region\u2019s chemical refineries. And Pizzolatto has described this season of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d \u2014 any that follow would have different characters and a different case \u2014 as \u201ca close, two-person point-of-view show.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting opportunity to explore how two white, middle-class men might have been hobbled by their perspectives into blaming poor men for rich men\u2019s crimes and coverups. A confrontation between two such men, the forces they\u2019re aligned against and their own views of the world would be a fraught and original encounter.\n\nBut the finale of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d didn\u2019t do any of that. Instead, we got a predictable crime story that even the show\u2019s most ardent defenders are going to be hard-put to argue is a clever examination of the genre, or of political power in Louisiana. The real killer of Dora Lange (Amanda Rose Batz), the first victim Rust and Marty investigated, turns out to be Errol Childress (Glenn Fleshler), the son of former sheriff Ted Childress. That relationship might have been enough to protect Errol, but he had other connections. Ted Childress was the unacknowledged son of Sam Tuttle, a powerful Louisiana patriarch. As a result, the Childresses were related to Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders), Sam Tuttle\u2019s son and a powerful minister who tried to interfere with Rust and Marty\u2019s initial investigation into the serial killings in 1995. And Ted\u2019s cousin was Eddie Tuttle, who served first as Louisiana governor and then as senator.\n\nThat\u2019s a rich web of power and family to explore, but \u201cTrue Detective\u201d leaves most of its revelations for the last hour of the show, leaving little time to meditate on specific relationships or Louisiana politics. Sheriff Childress covered up for Errol during the 1995 case, altering a missing persons case file to say that the report was made \u201cin error.\u201d His deputy sheriff, Steve Geraci, admits this all to Rust and Marty in the final episode, excusing his lack of curiosity about the change by telling the two men, \u201cThere\u2019s a chain of command. No reason to change it. I just follow what the big man says. It\u2019s how this all works.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s awfully anemic writing on a theme that\u2019s familiar to anyone with a bedtime late enough to let them stay up for \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d And Geraci\u2019s speech gives us no particular insight into what it might mean to be the \u201cbig man\u201d Childress apparently was in the specific time and place that was Louisiana in 1995. We certainly don\u2019t get any insight into why Rust and Marty weren\u2019t curious at the time that Billy Lee Tuttle wanted to gain control of their case by assigning it to a task force. Rust may end up castigating himself for not having identified Errol as the killer earlier. But he and Marty were, in their own ways, just as willing to look away from the Tuttles and Childress as Geraci, a man they threaten for his cowardice and blindness.\n\nRust and Marty don\u2019t show any more curiosity about a woman (the spectacular and underused Ann Dowd) they find with Errol, who appears to have some sort of intellectual disability \u2014 and neither does \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d As the police swam in to the Childress family estate, she sits, terrified, among the wreckage of Errol\u2019s mad fantasies, utterly alone. Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) later tells Marty that she was \u201cat least a half sister\u201d to Errol, substituting a lazy stereotype about Southern incest for any insight into how she, and Errol\u2019s dead victims, could go so utterly missing, or have been so invisible in the first place.\n\nMarty and Rust may have unhealthy relationships with women. But \u201cTrue Detective\u201d doesn\u2019t actually show any more interest in the vanished women than they did. The show took time to demonstrate that the stories Rust and Marty told other detectives were lies, and even to linger as Marty narrated his way through a public records database. But it couldn\u2019t make space in its eight episodes to give these women\u2019s lives more purpose than as catalysts for Rust and Marty\u2019s redemptions. Dora Lange emerges only in stories her ex tells about her. Prostitutes, domestic workers and chemical plant employees offer links in an investigative chain and are never heard from again.\n\nEven Marty\u2019s much put-upon ex-wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) and estranged daughters ultimately showed up in the hospital to provide Marty with a tangible reward for his follow-through. Given that \u201cTrue Detective\u201d has strongly implied from its earliest episodes that Marty\u2019s older daughter Audrey (Madison Wolfe) might have been a victim of abuse, or at least a witness to it, this disinterest in her inner life or the truth of what happened to her is particularly off-putting. In the world of \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d a man can do pretty much anything short of turning a woman into a paraphilic love map or trapping her in a house of horrors, and still deserve tender ministrations. And even as \u201cTrue Detective\u201d reacts in disgust to men who treat women as disposable, it also acts the same way toward Audrey, and to anyone who might have lived to receive the justice Dora Lange was denied.\n\nAfter Errol\u2019s been killed and the case has gone national, we see a credulous news anchor telling her audience that reporting \u201cdiscredited rumors that the accused was, in any way, related to Louisiana Senator Edmund Tuttle.\u201d The Tuttles don\u2019t even have to be tainted by association with a crooked branch in their family tree, much less take responsibility for any complicity they might have had in Errol\u2019s crimes. Rust is discouraged, because he and Marty both know from a horrifying videotape that Errol wasn\u2019t the only person involved in the ritual abuse of young women\u2013he was just the last surviving member of his horrifying little community. But Marty bucks him up by insisting that he and Rust did their share and shouldn\u2019t fret over the justice that\u2019s eluded them. \u201cWe ain\u2019t never gonna get \u2019em all. That ain\u2019t what kind of world it is,\u201d Marty says. \u201cBut we got ours.\u201d\n\nThat, apparently, is supposed to be enough to satisfy us. \u201cOnce there was only dark,\u201d Rust tells Marty as the two men look up at the stars. \u201cIf you ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d But telling us that the powerful will get off, and that there\u2019s nothing to learn about why it happens so why bother, is a view of politics even blacker and more tangled than the Lair of Crazy Errol built in an old French fort. The Rusts and Martys of that world end up recovering in the hospital with the luxury to reach those cynical conclusions. The Dora Langes of it end up dead.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u201cTrue Detective\u201d finale crashes HBO GO\n\nMeet the band behind the \u201cTrue Detective\u201d theme song", "143": "Photo still from True Detective \u00a9 2014 Home Box Office\n\n\n\nAs Rust Cohle warned us at the end of Episode 3 of True Detective, \u201cThis is a world where nothing is solved.\u201d At the end of the first season, the show didn\u2019t so much explain all the answers as gesture toward them, leaving us to fill in the blanks (or, perhaps, plot holes). Below, we take our best crack at answering the finale\u2019s big questions.\n\n\n\nWhat movie was Errol watching at the beginning of the finale? And what was with all the creepy accents?\n\n\n\nErrol is watching North by Northwest. True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto explained his thinking behind this scene in an interview with Alan Sepinwall:\n\nThere was this idea that when he talks in his real voice, it\u2019s very slurred because of the scarring. My background for him was that he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow were the Tuttles involved?\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear whether the Tuttles were directly involved in Errol\u2019s crimes or whether they just helped cover them up. Toward the end of the finale, a newscaster says that rumors of a suggested family tie between the senator and Errol Childress had been denied. But we know better: They\u2019re closely related, and the reverend, at least, was in deep. It seems likely that his powerful cousin was a part of the conspiracy, too, if not a participant in the crimes.\n\nThe reverend\u2019s father and the senator\u2019s uncle, Sam Tuttle, was Errol\u2019s grandfather. He raped both Errol and Errol\u2019s sister, and he was open enough about his sexual appetites that his housekeeper, at least\u2014whom we met in Episode 7\u2014was well aware of them. Reverend Tuttle knew more: He kept a videotape of Marie Fontenot\u2019s rape (and perhaps her murder), which occurred in the place Errol called Carcosa, in his safe. What\u2019s more, Reverend Tuttle helped cover up the sexual abuse that took place at one of his Wellspring schools, in part by dismissing a deacon and claiming that it was due to charges of embezzlement. Did he orchestrate the abuse as well? True Detective doesn\u2019t say.\n\n\n\nHow did Papania find Rust and Marty in order to save them?\n\n\n\nPresumably Marty is eventually able to find a working phone in the house to call him, though the episode doesn\u2019t show this happen.\n\n\n\nWhy does Rust say, \u201cL\u2019chaim, fat ass\u201d? Isn't that kind of a random thing for a nihilist Texan to say?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is the Rule of Cool. (If something\u2019s awesome enough, you don\u2019t need to explain it.) The slightly longer answer is that the quote seems to be a reference to Daredevil comics. Here\u2019s the panel in which Marvel superhero uses the line as a kiss-off to his archrival.\n\nAs people untangle tonight's True Detective, here's one source: a 2003 Daredevil with the \"L'chaim, fatass\" quip pic.twitter.com/hKh4garWC3 -- Ben Greenman (@bengreenman) March 10, 2014\n\nWho was the Yellow King?\n\n\n\nThis guy:\n\nPhoto courtesy HBO\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(Costume designer Jenny Eagan confirmed this in our interview.)\n\n\n\nAt Carcosa, how was Errol able to make his voice appear to be everywhere at once?\n\n\n\nSince Pizzolatto has said that \u201cthere is nothing supernatural\u201d about the crimes in True Detective, it seems safe to assume that this, like Cohle\u2019s final swirling cosmic vision, is a hallucination. (Either that, or Errol\u2019s \u201cCarcosa\u201d has really crazy acoustics.)\n\n\n\nIs there really a fort like that in Louisiana?\n\nYes. The Carcosa scenes were filmed on location at Fort Macomb, which was built in 1822.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Infrogmation courtesy Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nWhy did Errol draw so much attention to Dora Lange\u2014even lighting the fire that drew the police to her body?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPizzolatto offered his explanation in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:\n\nYou can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him.\n\nWhat does Errol mean when he says, \u201cMy ascension removes me the disc in the loop?\u201d\n\n\n\nErrol\u2019s mythology perhaps can\u2019t be reasonably explained\u2014the simplest answer seems to be simply \u201che\u2019s crazy\u201d\u2014but Pizzolatto offered his own explanation to Entertainment Weekly:\n\nIn the beginning, when he says, \u201cMy ascension removes me the disc in the loop,\u201d he\u2019s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he\u2019s hitting upon his personal mythology. When he says, \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since I left my mark, would they have eyes to see,\u201d we can tell from that that he\u2019s angling for a reckoning, for a showdown. He\u2019s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhy is the finale called \u201cForm and Void\u201d?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a reference to Genesis 1:2:\n\nAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n\nThis also ties back to Rust\u2019s closing speech. Rust reminds Marty, \u201cOnce there was only dark. You ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d It isn\u2019t until the following verse that God says, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat was up with the flower motif?\n\n\n\nIt may have been just a coincidence. In our interview with True Detective costume designer Jenny Eagan, we asked her if there was any hidden meaning to all the flowers featured in the costumes. She told us, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d\n\n\n\nDo painters really get paint on their ears?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWe put this question to Alan of the All Los Angeles Painting Company:\n\n\n\nSometimes? Not normally. You might get a few drops on them. Unless you\u2019re a member of the Three Stooges, or something. When you\u2019re an experienced painter, no, it\u2019s very rare. Unlesssss\u2014never mind, no. No, any level of experience, and it wouldn\u2019t happen, unless you were spraying all over and you weren\u2019t wearing a mask. And then you would have paint everywhere, not just on your ears.\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about Season 2?\n\n\n\nNot much. From that same Alan Sepinwall interview with Pizzolatto:", "144": "It is hard to recall the last time a television series has gripped the cultural consciousness so quickly, spawning memes, a sprawling amount of Internet speculation and commentary, as well as divisive conversations about gender roles on television (check out Emily Nussbaum\u2019s harsh, but terrific piece in The New Yorker for more on that) as much as True Detective has. At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.\n\nSince its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange\u2019s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show\u2019s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.\n\nThe foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.\n\nThe first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the \u201cspaghetti monster\u201d had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.\n\nHowever, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga\u2019s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven\u2019t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress\u2019s home.", "145": "Fans of the thriller \"True Detective\" were disappointed when HBO's streaming service crashed on Sunday during the much anticipated finale of the hit show.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNervously twitching and wired fans on the East Coast logged onto the HBO GO streaming service at 9 p.m. only to be faced with a spinning circle on a black screen.\n\nThe streaming service, which is only available by subscription, login, and password, apparently just had too many users logging in a once.\n\nHBO GO recognized the problem and send a tweet saying they were addressing the issue.\n\nDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users.

Theories about the Yellow King abounded on the Internet. Parody videos proliferated. Writer Nic Pizzolatto was interviewed about whether he\u2019d learned anything from the first season of The Killing, a show he worked on previously. People were nervous that True Detective might end in the same way that show had, by not coming to any conclusions at all.\n\nWhen the show arrived, an estimated 11 million people wanted to see how this would end. As many people tried to stream the show on HBO Go, the servers crashed and the wait for the finale continued for several hours.\n\n\u201cForm and Void\u201d picks up right where \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone\u201d left off last week. The episode opens at the Childress compound, where Errol Childress, the scarred man, is telling a man who is chained to a bed frame that if he behaves, he can have some more water around noon. Errol picks up a slop bucket, and leaves the small cottage, walking back to the main house, which is basically rotting away. In the house is a mentally challenged woman who is both cowed and cuddled by Errol. He asks her to tell him a story again, which turns out to be a description of her molestation by her grandfather.\n\nMeanwhile, Hart and Cohle are still on the fishing boat with Sheriff Gerasi, trying to get the real story of what happened in the Marie Fontenot case. Cohle forces Gerasi to watch the video of Fontenot\u2019s torture, and he spills the story from there. Gerasi took the original missing persons report on Fontenot. Later, he went back and the report was marked \u201cmade in error.\u201d Sheriff Childress had done this, claiming he\u2019d spoken to the family and that the girl had been sent to live with her father. Gerasi says that he had nothing else to do with the case, that he was following chain of command. Within a year, he was working for the state CID based on Sheriff Childress\u2019 recommendation.\n\nHaving received all the information they can from Gerasi, Hart and Cohle dock the fishing boat they stole, threaten Gerasi with a sniper if he says anything and head out to continue their investigation. They are still searching for the identity of the scarred man. The definitive clue comes from a picture taken during the canvassing during the Lange case. An elderly woman\u2019s recollection of getting her house painted leads Hart and Cohle through the tax records and leads them to the address of Childress & Sons maintenance.\n\nEver the pessimist, Cohle leaves his boss copies of their investigation notes and the video of Marie Fontenot\u2019s torture to be mailed to the authorities and the media. Should he and Hart disappear for more than a day, his boss is to mail the packages, which will hopefully lead the authorities to the Childress compound. Then Hart and Cohle take off to see what is afoot at the address they\u2019ve found. This brings us back around to the creepy, overgrown, dilapidated house from the beginning of the episode.\n\nThe car is barely parked in front of the house when Cohle takes off toward the cottage and fields beyond. Hart knocks on the door, posing as a surveyor who is lost and needs to use the phone. The woman answers the door, and says they don\u2019t have a phone. After Cohle yells for him, Hart pushes his way into the house, checking to make sure Errol isn\u2019t hiding in there. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come for you. He\u2019s worse than anyone,\u201d the woman warns him. Around this same time, Cohle spots Errol out in the field and takes chase after him.\n\nThe chase leads into some sort of catacomb/tunnel system. It\u2019s packed with the wicker sculptures that have peppered the crime scenes throughout the episodes. Cohle winds ever deeper through the vine choked passages in pursuit of Errol. As Errol taunts him from the distance, he speeds up, not checking corners as carefully. Entering a large chamber with an opening to the sky, Errol steps from the shadows and skewers Cohle with a large knife. He is lifted of his feet by the force of the thrust, and then dropped on the ground when Hart catches up with them. Hart catches an axe in the chest for his troubles. As Errol leans over him, Cohle manages to sit up and move around enough to shoot Errol in the head. It is an undetermined amount of time later when the authorities arrive and shoot a flare into the sky, which Hart and Cohle see through the hole in the ceiling of the chamber.\n\nBoth of the former detectives end up at Lafayette General Hospital. Marty\u2019s daughters and Maggie come to visit him, and he falls apart as he tries to convince them he\u2019s going to be okay. Cohle ends up in a coma after his surgery, but eventually awakes and hears more about the progress of the case on the news. Hart continually visits him, even making arrangements for where he\u2019ll go once he leaves the hospital. One night, Hart wheels his partner outside for a cigarette and the conversation turns to the case and how Cohle sees the whole experience. After he struggles to describe his near death experience, Cohle says that in the end, there is \u201cjust one story, the oldest. Light versus dark.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a succinct summation of this season of True Detective. It has been an intriguing, occasionally frustrating meditation on light versus dark. I\u2019m left with the sense that even though the light won this round, it was a very near thing. Perhaps what this show has done best is to explore the vast gray areas of personal and societal morality. When even the \u201cgood guys\u201d struggle to keep the darkness at the edges of their lives, what hope is there for all of us as a whole? Thank you, Rust Cohle. Now I sound as conflicted and pessimistic as you.", "147": "The demand for tonight\u2019s season finale of HBO\u2018s True Detective was so great online, the network\u2019s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed trying to fulfill all incoming requests for the closing episode. \u201cDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for # TrueDetective, we\u2019ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon,\u201d HBO GO tweeted earlier tonight. Service was eventually restored. The disruption reaffirms True Detective\u2018s status as a pop culture phenomenon, which it has been able to achieve in only eight episodes. It also underlines how inherently irrelevant traditional overnight ratings are with that so many HBO subscribers preferring to watch online, they overwhelmed the network\u2019s server. Of course, the streaming difficulties could have prompted True Detective fans who had no intention of watching the show on TV to do so, bringing extra viewers for the finale\u2019s Nielsen ratings. While the first season of True Detective was conceived as a closed-ended arc with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, creator Nic Pizzolatto is already working on a premise for a second season with new characters and a new storyline in a new locale.\n\n", "148": "HBO cracked the superb ratings code with True Detective, the immensely popular anthology whose season finale on Sunday night blew out the ratings and the HBO Go website in under an hour.\n\nAs the True Detective finale got underway last night, scores of viewers on pins and needles flooded the HBO Go website from their computers, iPads, phones and a variety of non-TV devices to live stream the final episode and learn the identity of the Yellow King. So many people tried to watch the True Detective finale live streaming at HBO Go that the website crashed for a period of time.\n\nSetting aside a large number of HBO subscribers that chose to online stream the finale, a total of 3.5 million viewers settled onto their couch to watch it on the HBO channel per Nielsen. That\u2019s the highest rated episode of the eight-episode run, easily besting the 2.3 million viewers who tuned in for the premiere.\n\nA total of 11 million unique viewers watched True Detective over the course of its first season. That\u2019s the most viewers to tune into a debut season of an HBO series since the Six Feet Under freshman season way back in 2001.\n\nWith as big a hit as True Detective has become, it\u2019s no surprise that HBO is pushing creator Nic Pizzolatto to get busy on a second season. Pizzolatto and HBO have already confirmed that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson will not return, and that the next anthology will be all new characters and a new story, ala American Horror Story.\n\nInformation is scarce about where the second season might head, but Pizzolatto did share the following with HitFix in an interview. \u201cThis is really early, but I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s about hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.\u201d\n\nIn case you missed True Detective last night, HBO Go is fully functional today and the season finale is waiting for you.", "149": "One of the things that made HBO\u2019s True Detective special is the way that it was made. Writer Nic Pizzolatto defied the conventions of television writing (where most scripts are written by committee in a writer\u2019s room) and instead holed himself up alone in a hotel and churned out all eight episodes.\n\nThe result was a wholly personal, truly singular vision overlaid on the most conventional of story structures: two cops hunting for a murderer. In Pizzolatto\u2019s hands, the fractured timeline slows to a crawl and suddenly hurtles forward, and through soliloquies and raised eyebrows reveals the damaged souls of two detectives who tend to say one thing and do just the opposite.\n\nIt\u2019s compelling stuff, and coupled with the masterful performances of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, it's a brand of storytelling that literally shut down HBO GO on Sunday, as viewers clamored to get first \u2013or second\u2014look at the season finale.\n\nThose first six or so episodes programmed us to expect almost anything from the True Detective finale. Except perhaps what we got. Pizzolatto provided the most surprising thing of all\u2014a straight ending. \u201cForm and Void\u201d featured no time shifting, no supernatural tangents, and relatively little in the way of metaphysical asides. (And no Yellow King.) But for the big stars and dazzling camera work, the last hour of True Detective would fit inside an episode of Law and Order. Most of it, anyway.\n\nIn the first 45 minutes or so, Hart and Cohle blitz through the procedures of this procedural as if they had a to-do list. Marty shakes the detective\u2019s curse, finally asking the right question: Why is the Green Monster green? From there they work the case step by step, bouncing from Steve Geraci\u2019s Maserati to an old woman\u2019s tax returns, until they end up rushing in real time from Hart\u2019s strip mall office to the Heart of Darkness.\n\nOur monster? He\u2019s holed up in a house that\u2019s straight out a very special episode of Hoarders, sporting an over-the-top British accent that channels James Mason. \u201cTop notch constitutional!\u201d Errol enunciates. And he calls his German Shepherd \u201cold chap\u201d even as he hurls a frying pan at him.\n\nAnd then it\u2019s the obligatory fight to the death. The scene nods toward Hart and Cohle's previous showdown with Reggie LeDoux. But as it dragged on, it reminded me of the last 15 minutes of The Silence of the Lambs after Anthony Hopkins has taken his fava beans and his nice chianti and split. It\u2019s well crafted but we\u2019ve been down this road before.\n\nUltimately, our heroes do what TV cops do: they catch the bad guy, and they save each other (although it was close for a minute there for ol\u2019 Rust, wudn\u2019t it?) It\u2019s almost like something out of that true crime book that Marty might write.\n\nPizzolatto\u2019s message is pretty straightforward: None of this really matters. Running through the woods with a gun is the least interesting thing that these cops do. I buy the premise, but I'd also argue that it could have been executed better.\n\nTrue Detective\u2019s strengths have been characterization and dialogue. Pizzolatto is great at telling stories, and, with the exception of Cary Fukunaga\u2019s brilliant, breathless single-shot staging of the raid in episode four, the show\u2019s best moments have come when he sticks to that MO.\n\nI think the finale is one place where True Detective might have been better served if Pizzolatto had some help. If these scenes were batted around in a writer\u2019s room\u2014with a couple of the guys from, say, Justified\u2014I believe that the other writers would would have found a way to add style and surprise to scenes that felt like housekeeping. Or they would have encouraged Pizzolatto to make the courageous choice to drastically shorten or even eliminate the procedural parts of the plot altogether.\n\nBut whatever the flaws of the finale\u2019s main plot arc, True Detective found its footing in the last few minutes. The internet notwithstanding, this has never been a story about Dora Lange or the Yellow King. It\u2019s about these two guys who need each other but can\u2019t say it. For all their physical courage, they lack the courage to, well, embrace life. L'chaim indeed, Rust Cohle.\n\nBringing Errol to justice and closing this case? That\u2019s really beside the point. These last two episodes were about healing the old wounds between old friends.\n\nRust Cohle may believe that it took a near-death- experience, in which he saw his departed daughter and his deceased dad, for him to change his view of the world. But it's clear to Pizzolatto--and us-- that seeing Marty again was every bit as important in Rust's transformation.\n\nIn the unlikely setting of a hospital parking lot, Marty and Rust both look heavenward and swap places, ontologically speaking.\n\n\"It's just one story: the oldest, light versus dark,\" says Cohle, vulnerable in a way we've never seen before.\n\n\u201cI know we ain't in Alaska \u201dsays Marty, with newfound grit. \"But it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.\"\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at it wrong, Once there was only dark,\" Cohle replies. \" If you ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nAnd a finely wrought as that dialogue is, it's Marty's little laugh as he helps his friend to the car that sums up the arc of this story. Not so much True Detective as True Bromance.\n\nWhat did you think of the True Detective finale? Share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@allstjohn) and Forbes.

The show, created by Nic Pizzolatto, follows two detectives played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson during their decades-long search for a cultish killer in the Louisiana bayous. The narrative winds up being equal parts whodunit, nihilist bromance, and name check on obscure weird fiction tales from the 19th century.\n\nAs the Internet blew up Sunday night with kvetching about the no show by HBO GO, the network tweeted this:\n\nDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users.

The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal,\" an HBO GO spokesperson said in an email sent to PCMag on Monday.\n\nSo how many True Detective viewers were affected by the service disruption? The show has averaged nearly 11 million viewers a week over its eight-episode run, according to The Daily Beast. That's about 38 percent of HBO's estimated 28.7 million subscribers, the site noted, leaning on stats from media research firm SNL Kagan.\n\nAnd how many of those subscribers tried to watch the series finale online? That's tough to say, though as Grantland's John Lopez quipped, perhaps the biggest revelation of True Detective turned out to be that \"HBO GO has a limit to how many people can share their passwords at one time: 11 million.\"\n\nFor more, check out Limited-Series TV and the Web: A Perfect Marriage.", "151": "Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister \u201crape club\u201d\u2014a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows. \u201cTrue Detective\u201d also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.\n\nWell, as of the finale, I\u2019ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle\u2019s monologues weren\u2019t window dressing. They were the whole point\u2014but I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man\u2014a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars\u2014was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie \u201cCold Comfort Farm\u201d (\u201cI saw something nasty in the woodshed!\u201d). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious \u201cX-Files\u201d episode \u201cHome,\u201d but after that everything went downhill.\n\nTo summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed \u201cChain of command!\u201d). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust\u2019s argument that Marty should be blamed for \u201cpushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.\u201d (Of course, Maggie couldn\u2019t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty\u2019s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell. \u201cErrol\u201d was behind all the show\u2019s central crimes: he\u2019d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he\u2019d helped organize the \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family\u2014although I haven\u2019t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThere was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading \u201cForgiven!\u201d And, over the show\u2019s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of \u201cLost,\u201d the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was \u201cfine, just fine,\u201d recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).\n\nI am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show\u2019s gross-out victims\u2014the dead \u201cprosts,\u201d the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty\u2019s own screwed-up daughter\u2014were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn\u2019t \u201caverted their eyes\u201d to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We\u2019re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can\u2019t pull that off.\n\nAs I said in the review, it\u2019s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I\u2019ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people\u2019s view of the other television that\u2019s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like \u201cTop of the Lake\u201d and \u201cThe Fall,\u201d as well as \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d \u201cSpiral,\u201d \u201cThe Returned,\u201d and the terrific new season of \u201cThe Americans\u201d\u2014varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d in part because they didn\u2019t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d is on its way, and so is \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Fingers crossed that there\u2019s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities! Just spare me anything atmospheric: I\u2019ve had enough hot air.", "152": "Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, True Detective\u2019s finale, titled \u201cForm and Void,\u201d took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction \u2014 as well as the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse. It was a tale that ripped dark marks on our bellies, then soothed us by \u201cmaking flowers\u201d on us. So to speak.\n\nWe start on the outskirts of the infernal plane. We begin in hell on earth. The ersatz underworld of The Yellow King \u2014 a.k.a. Errol Childress, a perverse product of paternal abuse, generational evil, and his own deranged, pop-culture informed myth-making \u2014 was a theater of the mind for a fantasy made real: His vision of Carcosa, the necropolis of Ambrose Bierce and the fallen world of Robert W. Chambers, littered with dead trees and body bags. Childress lured Cohle into his ascension chamber \u2014 the staging area for so many murders, and last night, a stage for an ancient ritual, the oldest story of all. Light versus dark. Good versus evil. \u201cLittle priest\u201d versus wannabe Elder God. It was The Real World: Dungeons and Dragons, and Cohle, hard boiled to the core, was ready to play. I\u2019ll see your abyss and gaze right back, Lawnmower Man!\n\nHe was fooling himself. Rust Cohle has always been fooling himself. His cynicism, his callousness were parts of the mask he wore to engage the world, to deal with himself. But it offered no protection when his mind \u2014 tweaking from the fetid evil around him \u2014 conspired against him and waylaid him with a vision of a coal-black vortex spiraling down to claim him. Maybe you were thinking: They\u2019re going to do it! Cthulhu is coming! Coming to take us away, ha-ha! Ho-ho! Hee-hee! Beam me up, Lovecraft!\n\nBut no. It was gotcha moment, for Rust, and for us. Childress seized him and cut him to the core, literally and spiritually, like a knife to an empty can of Lone Star. \u201cTAKE OFF YOUR MASK!\u201d The Monster bellowed. It was as if Childress was telling him to cut the phony bologna nihilist crap, the useful fairy tale of baggy and buggy sentient meat denying his truth. Of course, you can say the same of his agent of enlightenment, his doppelganger. True Detective was always all about authenticity \u2014 or rather, the lack thereof, and the stories we tell ourselves to get us through the day (religion, or nothingness, or our private Carcosas) and in turn imprint (and inflict) upon the world.\n\nWhat happened after Rust\u2019s gutting exposes us as well: the final 15 minutes of \u201cForm and Void\u201d struck me as a Rorschach test for what you want from stories like this, for what we\u2019ve come to call \u201cresolution,\u201d And boy, did we get a lot of it, both implied and explicitly stated, no more so during the last scene, with all of its mansplaining and bromantic uplift. Yes, uplift. The twist ending of True Detective\u2019s bleak first season: a bracing refutation of its baroque pessimism. Cohle and Hart slayed the decadently dandy slumdog (schizo?) psycho at dream\u2019s end, spent a good chunk of time processing their feelings and baring their souls, then exited, stage right, to star in The Odd Couple sitcom we\u2019ll never get to see. They were as stunned by this turn of events as we were. Cohle and Hart, flawed heroes and failed men, expected to be destroyed by their bid to pay the debt they owed the world, and so did I. If you had told me four episodes ago, after Rust\u2019s ugly Crash digression and Marty\u2019s complete unraveling, that we\u2019d get a happy ending in which they\u2019d be laughing and hugging and telling stories about the stars \u2014 like myth-making bards of antiquity \u2014 I would have thought you were a sauce-knackered tent preacher. What does say that about me? Perhaps a lifetime spent consuming stories has shaped my imagination to assume the worst. Or maybe I\u2019m just, like, a really hideous person.\n\nAnd so instead of losing their lives, Cohle and Hart were rewarded with new life. Marty found a little redemption \u2014 but not too much \u2014 and reconciliation he thought beyond him. Rust found some catharsis for the past, triggered by a near-death experience as his sense of self was becoming incoherent and fading away: A feeling of love and connection with his dead daughter and his beloved father. He wanted to sink and dissipate into that deep: \u201cI said, \u2018Darkness, yeah! [Instant classic McConaughey-ism!] And then I woke up,\u201d said Cohle, despairing that what felt so metaphysically real was only a dream. Still, in this moment, we truly saw Cohle for the first time: He shed his last layer to reveal the profound grief that drove him. Wow. I thought we would get a grim and gritty climax that affirmed a gloomy worldview; we thought we would get Chinatown. Instead, we got the deconstruction of hipster/pulp cynicism that says heroism is a crock and the recovery of old school virtue; we got Casablanca.\n\nA toast to Cohle and Hart, who deserve to be the penultimate* final statement on an era of anti-heroism and hideous men: Here\u2019s to the beginning of a beautiful relationship.\n\n*I think Don Draper should get the final word on this, don\u2019t you?\n\nTHE FASCINATION WITH ABOMINATION\n\nIn which we spend a few hundred words making sense of The Yellow King.\n\nWe won\u2019t be forgetting Errol Childress anytime soon. The collaboration of writing, directing, set and performance (Glenn Fleshler, terrific) in \u201cForm and Void\u201d combined to produce a memorable portrait of decadent, demented evil that was rich with layers and allusions and subtext.\n\nThe facts, as I understood them. Errol made his home in the boonies beyond the Creole Nature Trail. He kept his dead father \u2014 another lawless lawman and corrupt Tuttle, who with other Tuttles abused him and warped him and sewed his psyche with their perverse private religion \u2014 bound and lip-tied. He kept house with his half-sister. Made \u201cflowers\u201d on her, too. (Ewww.) He had stacks and stacks of books, magazines and DVDs in his trashed, fly-swarmed, fetid home. (Was The King In Yellow somewhere in those stacks?) He watched a lot of TV. (That was North by Northwest on the telly.) He was a man of many voices \u2014 Andy Griffith, Slingblade, James Mason \u2014 and seemingly no fixed identity.\n\nBut the intelligence behind those masks did fancy itself something monstrous. Errol lived to make his mark on the world by abducting and raping and killing children in ritualistic fashion with the help of his low-life cousins \u2014 his \u201cacolytes\u201d \u2014 the Ledoux brother, and littering the landscape with devil nets, occult graffiti, a Christian woman slain and transmogrified into an art object that mocked her faith. All were ironic reminders that evil roamed the land with impunity, and no one could \u2014 or would \u2014 stop him. Certainly not God. It bothered Errol, though, that no one had detected his handiwork: \u201cOh, if they had eyes to see,\u201d he said. The implication: Errol wanted to be discovered. What\u2019s more, he wanted to expose the family that had made him, that used him, that\u2026 worshipped him? And then there was the matter of Errol\u2019s last great project: His \u201cascension.\u201d He made a reference to tying off the endless loop of his life \u2014 his own circle of violence and degradation \u2014 and checking out \u2014 \u201cI am near the final stage. Some mornings, I can see the infernal plane.\u201d\n\nI am taken by the notion that Errol wanted to end his life by producing a story \u2014 his last ritual \u2014 in which he would play the part of The Great Adversary. He just needed some worthy Hero-Christs to play their parts in the play. He finally got them \u2014 after years of waiting? \u2014 in the form of Cohle and Hart. In that moment in the field, when Cohle told Errol to freeze, and Errol said \u201cNo,\u201d Errol wanted the detectives to follow him into his labyrinth. A grand battle ensued \u2014 Errol wasn\u2019t going to make it easy; our boys had to earn it \u2014 and Errol got his death-wish made true by Cohle, no stranger to death-wishes. Cohle shot him in the head, and the image we got framed Errol\u2019s exploding head within the hole in the roof of his chamber. Behold Errol\u2019s violent enlightenment, his ascension, his storytelling mission accomplished.\n\nOf the many details that defined Errol, I am thinking most at present about all that pop culture lying around his house. Errol\u2019s story concluded one of True Detective\u2019s themes/morals: Be careful what you put in your head. You spend your days filling your head with pictures of evil (Cohle, ep. 3), you spend your days filling your imagination with faces of evil and stories about evil (Errol, and his Carcosa-crazed family, Hitchcock flicks, and who knows what else Errol kept lying around), you spend your days fascinated with abomination, and chances are, they\u2019re going to affect the way you see the world.\n\n+++\n\nHeading into the finale, I saw several pieces lobbying for a \u201cno resolution\u201d ending to True Detective. No hard answers, no final declarations. Resist the desire to be just like any other cop show! Their argument was that True Detective wasn\u2019t really about the murders and rapes and the ritualistic desecration of children and women, wasn\u2019t really about its mysteries of history and corruption and secrets and lies. It was about the characters of Cohle and Hart, and their charged bromance, and Cohle\u2019s ridiculous philosophizing, and Hart being a dork, and the world, and the landscape, and the existential unknowability of absolute truth and the mood \u2014 oh, the gloriously fetid mood.\n\nI respectfully disagree. It\u2019s a misread of the story to argue that True Detective has always been resolution-agnostic, that it should have given us an ending with question marks instead of periods. The first six episodes were narratively driven by Cohle and Hart\u2019s storytelling, but we see now \u2014 and this is important and not to be overlooked \u2014 that the story was always framed by two detectives searching for truth: Papania and Gilbough, who we now know to be righteous, honorable cops. The portraits of Cohle and Hart that emerged depicted obsolete modes of masculinity and worldviews, who were unworthy of the heroism that was required of them \u2014 but became so by submitting to total deconstruction.\n\nThe last two episodes saw Cohle and Hart taking responsibility for a broken world that they helped to break. I loved how this was expressed in the procedural scenes, and I was grateful we got a lot of them in the past two weeks. It was great seeing the detectives actually be detectives \u2014 especially diligent, thorough Hart, who made the key connection that put them in the road to Childress. Even Cohle was impressed: \u201cF\u2014 you, man!\u201d High praise!\n\nBottom line: The organizing principle of True Detective was restoring law to a lawless land. Telling me to not care about that \u2014 to not want resolution for that \u2014 is to be cynical about character transformation. It asks me to not care about justice. And that\u2019s what \u201cresolution\u201d meant here: justice. There is a kind of existential pulp that can get away with moral ambiguity (Breaking Bad), or supernatural existentialism that can get away without explaining its metaphysics (Lost). This was neither.\n\nYes, it was earnest. It certainly defied common medical sense: How the hell did Rust survive that gutting? Dude plunged that blade deep into his belly, lifted him off the ground and let him hang and tear a little on its jagged edge. Ouch! But it was interesting how the final 15 minutes gave us a series of very distinct scenes, each representing a different kind of ending that could have worked for both this story and this kind of story, yet worked together to create another meaning altogether:\n\nDo you like your pulp colder than Jack Nicholson\u2019s naughty bits at the end of The Shining? Then remember forever Hart cradling Cohle \u2014 both bleeding to death \u2014 looking up into the empty eye of God formed by the opening in the ceiling in Childress\u2019 ascension chamber, seeing a flare \u2014 a flicker of hope \u2014 and crying out: \u201cHere! We\u2019re here!\u201d Basically: The Book of Job, before the restoration.\n\nDo you prefer some resolution but not complete resolution? Then remember forever our fallen warriors in the hospital: Hart reunited with family, suddenly feeling healed, then remembering he is not, that his encounter with horror has left him far afield from anything like \u201cfine.\u201d And Cohle, looking hollowed and husked \u2014 a grizzled, lost Frodo after his awful apocalypse at Mount Doom.\n\nDo you need happy ending uplift? Then remember forever Hart coaching Cohle toward hope and stars, and Cohle tearfully recognizing that his protest-too-much nihilism has been so much sound and fury, and both men hobbling away, arm in arm.\n\nTaken together, all those scenes created a nuanced climax. Kudos to True Detective for not making too much of Cohle and Hart\u2019s heroic achievement. Yes, it felt mythic, but that\u2019s because we got a climax set in The Yellow King\u2019s fraudulent \u201cpsychosphere,\u201d and most of it from Cohle\u2019s muddled perspective. Cohle the Pulp Christ so wanted the grandiose knock-out punch \u2014 what a way to go out, to tie off the vicious circle of violence and degradation, both in himself and in his culture; to solve the problem of evil once and for all! (Take THAT, Silent God!) But Hart corrected him, right-sized him; that was not their job, not their fight, and really, nothing they were qualified for. This small chapter of the never-ending story was more than enough and screwed them up good. Leave the rest to the next generation. Leave it to the duly empowered (and totally righteous) Gilbough and Papania.\n\nAnd this why I loved that True Detective let Cohle and Hart live \u2014 or rather, made them live. Their \u201crewards\u201d for saving the day? Shredded illusions. Painful self awareness. The opportunity to spend all of their remaining years trying to get over the horror, the horror. The only real feel-good compensations? They get each other; they get to figure their sh\u2013 out together. My favorite parts of the finale? When Hart called Cohle his \u201cfriend;\u201d when Cohle entrusted a man he found so easy to judge with this weakness and tears.\n\nYeah, yeah: CORNY. But I buy it. Because it\u2019s true. And I\u2019ll take it from almost any story, flaws and all, if I feel it earned it. And I say True Detective did.", "153": "- Advertisement -\n\nTent preacher Joel Theriot's full sermon from episode three of True Detective provides a preview and explanation of detective Rust Cohle's conversion from a laconic nihilist extraordinaire who can barely live with himself to an enlightened soul with some prospect for peace.\n\nIn episode 7, Cohle laments his long journey through violence and depravity then says I'm ready to tie it off. Many suspected that this forecast death for Cohle in the final episode. In a very real sense, that theory proved correct but it was a different type of death.\n\nAs it turns out, True Detective is the story of a seeker of truth. Rust Cohle's moment of enlightenment in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle's struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room. The seemingly less than sophisticated preacher and an audience of those at the margins of life in rural Louisiana hide the profound message delivered for those willing to listen. Episode 3 shows only a portion of the sermon. The entire sequence is available on YouTube and is well worth watching (several times).\n\nThe sermon represent a narrative map for the broader story told throughout the series, which reaches a climax at the end of the season finale. Of note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity. He both delivers the sermon to and experiences it with the congregation as indicated by their frequent, fervent interaction. There are no strictures, admonitions, or rules; just the presentation of a higher wisdom and path to inner peace available to everyone with ears to hear. Theriot's sermon is in italics along with my comments.\n\nHe saw you in those dark corners. He heard you. Oh brothers, he heard those thoughts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe question, are you there?\n\nSince the death of his daughter, Cohle has suffered unrelenting guilt for failing to protect her. For years, Cohle has been the only person listening to his thoughts. No one else is there. He is alone without comfort.\n\nWould that we had ears to hear, because every moment, every now is an answer. Every beat of every heart, every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day is an answer.\n\nAnd the answer is yes, yes, yes.\n\nTheriot has a forceful answer to the question Are you there? He is and he is with us every moment. But what does he represent. Everything in the scene tells us that he is Jesus. But we don't hear the name Jesus until four minutes into the six-minute sermon. Cohle and partner Marty Hart are seen at the back of the tent watching Theriot preach. Cohle's nonchalant attitude, leaning against the tent post is more than disinterest. It represents contempt from the Cohle we know up to this point. (In the final airing of this episode, he says to Marty: What do you think the average IQ of this crew is? I see a propensity for obesity, poverty and fairy tales.)\n\nYour sorrows pin you to this place. They divide you from what your heart knows. \" We bandaged our soft selves in hardness and anger. You are a stranger to yourself and yet he knows you.

Because I ask you, how could a father forget his children?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCohle became a stranger to himself as a result of hardness and anger due to the death of his daughter. He was so hardened to the world, so profoundly skeptical and alienated, it broke Cohle from his body; separated him from the embrace and protection of the peace surrounding him at the time of his greatest need.\n\nIf ever your sorrow becomes such a burden that you forget yourself, forget this world, I want you to remember this truth\"\n\nThis world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "154": "So it turns out this live streaming of popular TV programs is harder than it looks.\n\n\u201cWatch now?\u201d True Detective fans said through gritted teeth. \u201cWhy, I\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nViewers who opted to watch Sunday night\u2019s finale of True Detective via HBO Go, the pay channel\u2019s streaming app, were treated to the kind of shocking twist they probably could have done without: The streaming service went belly up shortly after the final episode began airing at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd the reason you couldn\u2019t watch True Detective on HBO Go Sunday night?

Now that we've reached the end I think many of us missed the point. (Although, I very much agree with Romano's piece about \"True Detective\" being an examination of storytelling and the power of storytelling. But there are a number of subtexts, meta-writing and philosophies at work on this series. It's one of the reasons this first season has been so great.)\n\nNow that's all said and done, I think \"True Detective\" is mainly about our two detectives, Rust and Martin Hart, and how they've changed. Creator Nic Pizzolatto has long said this is solely a story about these two detectives. Now, Pizzolatto uses these protagonists to expound a number of philosophies (Nietzsche and Tom Ligotti's excellent case for the pessimist viewpoint in \"The Conspiracy Against Human Beings\"), literary references (Robert Chambers' \"The King in Yellow\") and ideas about religion that are utterly compelling.\n\nBut for me, Pizzolatto did something amazing by examining the human condition through a focus on two men, and presented an outstanding case for the duality of human nature. As Rust said, \"Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution\" responsible for all the evil in this world. While that's surely a valid point, Rust eventually finds beauty in human consciousness by the end of it all. Human consciousness has the potential for horrible things, but it can also create wonderful, powerful love. Through Rust and Marty, we see the capacity for change. Despite all of Rust's \"Time is a flat circle\" nihilism where nothing changes and \"nothing is solved,\" he does actually change, a lot, over the course of this 17-year story, as does Marty.\n\nFor all the horrors Rust faced in his lifetime - tweakers injecting infant daughters with meth, Medea murdering mothers and the countless terrors from his four-year stint as an undercover Narco - only one thing forever changed him, the love between him and his daughter. Rust became a shell (sentient meat) of a soul after her death, and then found redemption in her undying love. The longer he refused to acknowledge the importance and power of human connection, the more of a toll it took on him mentally (his pessimism) and physically (his alcoholism).\n\nSome folks may complain about his final revelation. That an all-powerful love exists (even after death), and that this is a violation of who Rust was throughout the entire series. But I found it to be both a welcomed \"twist\" and somewhat hopeful ending that conveyed much of the contrasting ideas at play this season. (It also helped that Matthew McConaughey had one of his most powerfully gut-wrenching monologues in that final scene with Marty outside the hospital. Give that man all the awards.)\n\nAnd while Rust had the most dramatic transformation after the showdown with Errol William Childress in Carcosa - more on that below - Marty had a pretty big one too. Marty had always prided himself on his \"steady\" family man status, but had taken that family's love for granted, whether out of selfishness, pain or just obliviousness. Once he's visited by his daughters and ex-wife in the hospital he tries to tell them \"he's okay,\" but he can't lie anymore. He hasn't been okay for a longtime, and maybe if he'd realized it sooner his family would still be in the picture. Now that he has, maybe Marty can begin to make amends and find some peace, at least by being a father.\n\nBoth Rust and Marty were immensely flawed men, though not as much as Reggie Ledoux or Errol. But they did some terrible things. Marty hurt a woman who loved him deeply and alienated his two daughters. If anyone, he epitomized Rust's words about \"The sin of being a father\" and just never realized it. While Rust claimed to have all the answers and was just \"A bad man keeping other bad men form the door,\" he actually wasn't. Rust Cohle was a very damaged person who could've easily given in to the darkness and fallen into the abyss of Carcosa. But he didn't because that love for his daughter and her love for him wouldn't let that happen, even if he only realized it much later.\n\nNow \"True Detective\" ended on a somewhat hopeful notion, even if many of the individuals involved in the Carcosa/Yellow King conspiracy will never be found out or brought to justice, and I'm glad about that. Rust and Marty, and many other people, had to suffer greatly throughout this season of \"True Detective,\" and presenting the power of undying love at the conclusion acted as a counterbalance to that suffering. Pizzolatto was showing the duality of human nature, how it could be corrupted and evil, but also loving and willing to fight that evil. This duality is exemplified by how different Rust and Marty were from each other, but also in how they were individually, conflicted souls waging a war within. For as much as \"True Detective\" was about the darkness, it felt completely organic to end on Rust's, \"Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light's winning.\"\n\nAnd \"True Detective\" could've ended in the most horrific fashion imaginable. I began to think that was where we were headed after Errol seemed to get the upper-hand on Rust and Marty. And that final hunt through Carcosa - a hellhole of sickness and evil with the piles of children's clothes, retched skulls and devil nests, and a haunting chamber of death - and battle was just so well done. Kudos to Pizzolotta and Cary Joji Fukunaga for coming up with and executing a scene more frightening and intense than the climax to \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Also, the opening look into the Childress household and \"making flowers\" - shudder - was super creepy. That Errol's Yellow King was a total psychopath created by generations of abusive psychopaths also fit with \"True Detective's\" theme about the responsibility of being a parent and how neglecting that can have dangerous outcomes.\n\nIf Pizzolatto had decided to kill both Rust and Marty, the call never gets made for reinforcements and the murder of innocent women and children just continues, that would have been okay too. It would've fallen in direct correlation to Rust's pessimism and ideas that we're all just floating along in this \"thresher\" or \"giant gutter in space.\" And it would have been a super ballsy and utterly tragic way to end this story. But I'm glad Rust and Marty found redemption and catharsis in the end. And I don't think I fully realized how much I would have been devastated if Errol did win, until it looked like he was going to. (It was hard enough to sleep last night. I don't think i could've if Errol was still out there.) Again, this was just a magnificent way for the story to unfold that left me on the edge of my seat.\n\n\"True Detective\" is already on my short list for best TV show of 2014, and I doubt it will unseated from the number one spot. It's early in the year, but this show was incredibly acted by McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and some of the smaller characters like Shea Whigham's Joel Theriot and Glenn Fleshler as Errol in the finale. \"True Detective\" was also beautifully directed by Fukunaga; every episode was just a masterpiece. But in the end, I'm giving the biggest hat tip to Pizzolatto.\n\nThe narrative, and all the different subtexts swirling around inside of it, that Pizzolatto created was just brilliant when all was said and done. I didn't need for Marty's daughter found to be abused by the cult of the Yellow King, or for Marty's father-in-law to be involved. This was a messy end to a messy tale. There is still evil out there, and maybe Marty's daughter saw that evil first-hand. But there will always be evil and darkness in this world, especially if we don't see it explicitly. There's also a small, strong fragment of light that will hopefully shine on evil. And maybe that's what \"True Detective\" is really saying in this first season - that two men with inherent darkness found a way to let the light in, if only for an instant, and save themselves from a path of wickedness and sin.", "156": "The musician will use a keynote speech at the film and music conference on Tuesday (11Mar14) to unveil his PonoMusic.com service and PonoPlayer device, which is intended to offer a better-quality alternative to iPods and other MP3 players.\n\nA statement issued by Young reads: \"It's about the music, real music.

The PonoPlayer will have a list price of $399 (Dh1,465) and be capable of storing 1,000 to 2,000 high-resolution digital albums, according to the PonoMusic statement.

Neil Young announces his plans to unveil a high-end online music store and portable device to go along with it.\n\nPonoMusic is the brainchild of Young, with the engineering particulars taken care of by Ayre Acoustics in Boulder, Colorado. Described as a \u201cdesktop media management application,\u201d it works much like any other music service: fans can download and manage music on computers, then sync it onto the PonoPlayer, which is supposed to be a higher resolution playable device. In fact, the main goal of the project seems to be its capacity for protecting the music in its most digitally advanced form. The news release on the product hails the PonoPlayer\u2019s high-definition ability and says it will \u201callow consumers to experience studio master-quality digital music at the highest audio fidelity possible, bringing the true emotion and detail of the music, the way the artist recorded it, to life.\u201d It goes on to say that the albums and tracks will come from a variety of different labels, some well-known, others bordering on the independent and more obscure. In short, it\u2019s not a brand new technological concept, but it\u2019s a chance for die hard music lovers to hearken back to the days of better audio fidelity, the chance for them to pay a little extra for a service and device that aim to protect the integrity of the original sound. It\u2019s depending on the support of the segment of listeners that have felt a little jilted by the ever growing school of thought that\u2019s willing to sacrifice quality for easy accessibility.\n\nThe triangular-prism-shaped device doesn\u2019t look all that different from the group of MP3 players, IPods and other portable music players that are out on the market right now, although it boasts an easy-to-use, modern LCD touchscreen. The first release of the player includes 128 GB of storage and can hold 1,000-2,000 high-resolution albums. PonoMusic was quick to include that it will be marketing memory cards for the player, so that listeners can keep as many different playlists and collections of music on hand as they want to. The company will also sell accompanying products like earbuds and headphones on its website.\n\nMaybe the most interesting part of Young\u2019s announcement is the way that the device and the service will be marketed.

Unfortunately, this trend of ultra-music compression has only increased as listeners seek to cram more and more music into smaller and smaller devices responsible for a seemingly infinite amount of purposes. Luckily, the music world has a new savior \u2013 Neil Young.\n\nFor quite some time now, Neil Young has been bemoaning the inherent loss of music quality that is derived whenever one compresses music files into MP3 and other ultra-small formats: \u201cIt\u2019s not that digital is bad or inferior, it\u2019s that the way it\u2019s being used isn\u2019t doing justice to the art . . . The convenience of the digital age has forced people to choose between quality and convenience, but they shouldn\u2019t have to make that choice.\u201d\n\nYoung was so vehement about his feelings about the loss of music quality in today\u2019s day and age that he went one step beyond bitching and moaning; Tomorrow at South by Southwest, Young will officially unveil his solution to this music crisis, the PonoPlayer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the music, real music. We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does that. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about bringing PonoMusic to the market,\u201d stated Young.\n\nSo what does the PonoMusic do that is so revolutionary to the music industry? Well, for Young it all starts with less compression and a more full-bodied sound: \u201cThe simplest way to describe what we\u2019ve accomplished is that we\u2019ve liberated the music of the artist from the digital file and restored it to its original artistic quality \u2013 as it was in the studio. So it has primal power.\u201d\n\nIn other words, PonoMusic has created its own digital file format different from mp3 or flac or wma. These new music files will be compressed at 192 kHz and have a 24-bit sound (A format that some people believe will still not solve the music quality crisis.) Perhaps most important of all, however, is that these files attempt to capture the pure essence of the music as it is recorded, mainly by preserving the natural echoes that occur in studio.\n\nYoung has been as bold as to state that \u201cHearing Pono for the first time is like that first blast of daylight when you leave a movie theater on a sun-filled day.\u201d\n\nWhile the before-mentioned statement may be true, there are already a few drawbacks to the PonoPlayer. All reports indicate that the PonoPlayer will be priced at $399 at its launch, an extremely steep price when one compares it to other devices which also play music exclusively. Unfortunately, that $399 price tag also comes with less overall music storage; while the PonoPlayer comes with a 128 GB hard drive, its file compression is much larger, resulting in being able to store less music. And last, but definitely not least, is the design of the PonoPlayer. Its triangular, Toblerone-esque appearance is sure to deter people from purchasing the product. (How would one fit it in a pocket?)\n\nUltimate judgment will have to be reserved until the product hits the shelves.

It has 128GB of memory and can store 1,000 to 2,000 high-resolution music albums, according to the leaked release.\n\nYoung, a Grammy Award winner who has been recording since the 1960s, will unveil the player on Tuesday at the SXSW 2014 Music Conference. He has been working on the project based on the belief that MP3 and CD are \"flawed\" digital music formats, as PonoMusic said on its website.\n\nData that is \"trapped\" on recordings made over the last 50 years can be used to recreate music as it sounded by the musicians that originally played it, according to the company.\n\n\"Hearing Pono for the first time is like that first blast of daylight when you leave a movie theater on a sun-filled day,\" Young was quoted as saying on PonoMusic's Facebook page.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the PonoPlayer will only appeal to audiophiles or will find a wider following. Commentators on the Facebook page questioned its price, triangular form and whether the improved music fidelity will actually be discernible.\n\nHowever, the growing, if cult, popularity of music releases on vinyl indicates that there is an appetite for music recordings with a fuller sound than is permitted by compressed digital files.\n\nThe project also involves an online music store called PonoMusic, and a desktop media management app called Pono. It can sync with the PonoPlayer as well as other high-resolution devices, the company said without giving details.\n\n\"Pono has huge potential to get civilians into better sounding music,\" audiophile Chris Connaker wrote in response to comments about the press release that he leaked. \"All ships rise with the tide.\"", "171": "Neil Young devotees have been hearing about Pono or \"PureTone\" for a while now, and the public will finally be able to get their hands on the new digital format. The classic rocker, who's been the driving force behind Pono, will unveil the first PonoPlayer at SXSW on Tuesday. Interested buyers can register preorders via Kickstarter on Saturday, March 15.\n\nThe PonoPlayer was developed in coordination with Ayre Acoustics, will be available starting at $399.99 (although Kickstarter buyers will receive a discount). The device will be able to store \"100-500 high-resolution digital albums,\" depending on the length and resolution of the original recording. If you want to add more music to your device, you can buy memory cards to attach to the device. Yes, exactly like with your Playstation 2.\n\nThe selling point to Pono is that the files are reportedly much, much higher quality than the .mp3s on your iPod. Young reports that a typical mp3 file features 5 percent of the data contained in a Pono file. The files feature zero-feedback circuitry and a digital feature to prevent \"unnatural pre-ringing.\"\n\n\"Hearing Pono for the first time is like that first blast of daylight when you leave a movie theatre on a sun-filled day,\" he said.\n\nThe concept behind Pono is beautiful. The problem is that it comes so far behind iTunes' domination of the digital music industry. We bought an iPod that stores 160gb for $200 back in 2008. And we may be a bit more invested in music than the average listener, but we already own all of our favorite records on vinyl. If we had the money, we'd love to buy a Pono system. We don't, and the average listener would rather shill-out for better headphones than a better format. We-as music fans- also approve of Pono's whole album-versus-singles approach. But that's also going to turn off the average listener.\n\nWe wish Young and Pono the best of luck, for the sake of music quality, but it's going to struggle finding a market.", "172": "Neil Young\u2019s high-fidelity version of the iPod\u2014Pono\u2014has been in the works for some time, and now it\u2019s just about ready to launch.

While it\u2019s still unclear what the demand will be for a new music player\u2014or whether Young fans actually care this much about audio fidelity\u2014the Pono is DRM-free, so that\u2019s kind of neat.\n\n", "173": "Neil Young is going to change the way you listen to music.

The sound is described as \"master-quality digital music at the highest audio fidelity possible,\" which allows listeners to feel the true emotion and detail of the music, \"the way the artist recorded it.\"Young initially unveiled plans for the higher-quality digital music in 2012, after he revealed in an interview with AllThingsD that he had discussed high definition music formats with former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ahead of his death. Young has been in favor of higher definition music formats for several years, but such formats require larger files, which may have held Apple back from jumping on board.Apple offers iTunes music in an AAC format at a quality of 256 kbps and while the company does support a lossless audio format , the files take up more space than AAC files and are not sold on the iTunes Store.Young's PonoPlayer works in conjunction with the yet-to-be-released PonoMusic service , which pledges to \"significantly improve the way you get to hear and feel your favorite music.\" The PonoPlayer itself will ship with 128GB of memory, storing from 100 to 500 high resolution albums.As for Apple's line of iPods, several of the devices, including the nano, the shuffle, and the classic, have gone more than three years without an update. Apple did introduce a minor color change for some of the devices, but it appears the company may be planning to phase out several models. The exception may be the iPod Touch, which was updated with a new design in 2012.During a recent conference call, Tim Cook called the iPod a declining category for the company, which has been overtaken by more popular offerings such as the iPhone and the iPad. \"All of us have known for some time that the iPod is a declining business,\" he said.The $399 PonoPlayer will be introduced to the public via a Kickstarter project that is set to go live later this week.", "175": "Justin Bieber dedicated a song to his ''baby'' Selena Gomez during a surprise performance in Texas last night (09.03.14).\n\nThe 20-year-old singer turned up at the Banger's Sausage House and Beer Garden in Austin last night for the South by Southwest festival, and sang his hit 'As Long As You Love Me' for his ''baby''.

Officials in the Centennial State reportedly said the numbers for January were in line with their expectations. Medical marijuana sales, which have been legal since 2000, brought in $900,000 in taxes last month.\n\nAs is the case when tax money rolls in, the powers-that-be will wrangle over its allocation. The first $40 million from the 15% excise tax is slated for school construction. Meanwhile, Colorado Gov.

No need. In Colorado, marijuana sales are already on fire.\n\nIn its first month since becoming legal, Colorado's 59 licensed pot dispensaries generated more than $14 million in sales, according to figures released by the state's Department of Revenue. That resulted in $3.5 million in state tax revenue, about $2 million of which came from sales of recreational marijuana.\n\nOf course, it's too early for the industry to claim any major victories, and the initial sales surge will most likely taper off. However, the number of Colorado's licensed retail marijuana shops is on the rise. As of late last month, there were nearly 170 registered in the state.\n\nWhile some banks have been leery of doing business with licensed retail marijuana stores because the sale of pot is still illegal under federal law, the marijuana market in the U.S. -- recreational and medical -- is only expected to grow. One San Francisco-based investor group forecasts that the national market for legal pot could jump to $10.2 billion over the next five years.

Now that she's gone recreational, she believes that by the fall, she'll be making $100,000 a day.\n\nThe new gold rush in Colorado is decidedly green.\n\nThat first day drew huge lineups, three hours long, at dispensaries \u2014 like the ones at Apple stores on the day a new iPhone comes out.\n\nNo one whined. Many of those waiting in line that freezing Colorado winter morning \u2014 a dry cold, as they say here \u2014 were going to buy legal pot for the first time in their lives.

The state might even make as much as $150 million this year in marijuana taxes (almost double previous estimates). Much of that money will be by law reinvested in schools and education.\n\nIt's early days, of course, but there has been no reported increase in crime or traffic accidents.\n\nOne imponderable, though: how to test for driving under the influence of marijuana?\n\nAnd then there is the banking issue.\n\nBanks are still nervous about accepting drug profits \u2014 it's still a crime federally here in the U.S. \u2014 although Washington has said it won't prosecute in states where pot is legal.\n\nMany dispensaries store their money in safes.

On PBS\u2019s Charlie Rose, Son claimed the only way to competitively move forward was with a merger, promising a \u201cmassive price war\u201d if he gets his way. Further commentary also suggest Son has the patience and tenacity to see his vision through.\n\nIn the interview, Son says a three-dog race is the only way to have a \u201creal fight\u201d. In Son\u2019s view, neither Sprint nor T-Mobile can scale quickly enough to make an impact on the Verizon/AT&T dominance. Though a merger still places a new company in third place with regard to customer count, it\u2019s much more level. A new company would have around 100 customers, just behind Verizon with 102 million and AT&T with around 110 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in a more massive price war, a technology war\u201d said Son, tapping into carrier complacency regarding Internet speeds in the US. as another reason he\u2019d like to make a merger happen. \u201cThe mobile Internet, the Internet highway, is the most important infrastructure for the 21st century. We would like to make the deal happen\u201d.\n\nRegulators are notoriously opposed to mergers of this kind, preferring to have four major carriers instead of three. The previous acquisition involved T-Mobile and AT&T, so it may have just been the scale that bothered regulators in that case. A Sprint merger with T-Mobile would still leave them in last place, and disparate technology (for now\u2026) only makes it less seamless.\n\nAnother concern is competitive practices. Regulators are worried less competition means less value for consumers, a concern Son is working hard to quell. Having recently met with the FCC to discuss such matters, Son is now pleading his case to the people. Son says he\u2019s willing to lose money initially on the deal to wage his war, instead opting to level his battle field with pricing first. We\u2019ll hope more details arrive before an offer is made \u2014 we\u2019d love to see his plans for disrupting the current market.\n\nVia: Bloomberg\n\n", "201": "The U.S. wireless industry might get shaken up if SoftBank and Sprint have its way. Over the past few months rumors have been going around about a possible merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, SoftBank already has a controlling stake in Sprint. Top executives from both the parent company and the carrier have reportedly been courting regulators and taking their temperature, trying to ascertain if a takeover bid will be blocked based on regulatory concerns. The idea is that Sprint and T-Mobile together will be able to launch an effective competition against Verizon and AT&T. In an interview with Charlie Rose, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said that he\u2019d like to have \u201cthe real fight\u201d for supremacy in this arena and that when that becomes possible, he\u2019d wage a \u201cmore massive price war\u201d against the two behemoths.\n\nIts possible that the strategy Son has in mind is to undercut both Verizon and AT&T on price. While this would reduce revenue in the short term, it would maximize growth and market share over the long term. Even combining Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s entire user base doesn\u2019t bring it close to what AT&T holds, and Verizon sits even further than that. If the tail enders of the U.S. wireless industry get together, the two behemoths could get a run for their money.\n\nBut its not like regulators haven\u2019t blocked a similar bid before. In 2011, AT&T agreed to acquire T-Mobile for $39 billion only for the deal to be shot down by regulators. One could make the case that AT&T would have had an unfair advantage due to its already strong position, had the deal gone through, and that the outcome won\u2019t be the same with Sprint. Regulators held back then that four national carriers are healthy for maintaining competition in the U.S. wireless industry, if their beliefs haven\u2019t been shaken, then its unlikely that Sprint and T-Mobile will ever get together.\n\nFiled in .

The show is scheduled to be broadcast late on Monday in the United States.\n\nThe possibility of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which was acquired by Softbank last year, was given the cold shoulder by regulators, with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler expressing scepticism in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on February 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter.\n\nRegulators are concerned that reducing the number of major wireless carriers to three from four would hinder competition, but Son has argued that competition would be more robust if a third strong player is created through the merger of smaller firms Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nSoftbank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves towards pursuing a deal were now on hold. The official declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak about the matter publicly.\n\nSon plans to present his vision for the U.S. wireless communications industry in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, although a person familiar with the matter said he would not talk about a bid for T-Mobile.\n\n(Reporting by Sophie Knight and Yoshiyasu Shida in Tokyo; Writing by Edmund Klamann; Editing by Miral Fahmy)", "203": "SoftBank Corp. President Masayoshi Son will start a \u201cmassive price war\u201d if U.S. regulators allow his company to purchase T-Mobile US Inc., he said in an interview with PBS\u2019s Charlie Rose.\n\nThe billionaire, who bought control of Sprint Corp. last year, said combining the third- and fourth-largest U.S. mobile- phone carriers would give him enough scale to compete against larger operators AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nSon, 56, said he was willing to postpone profit to gain market share and would use price cuts to draw users. He has met resistance to a T-Mobile deal from U.S. regulators skeptical that cutting the number of national wireless carriers to three would promote competition.\n\n\u201cWe need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK,\u201d Son said during the interview with Rose, airing nationally in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\u201d\n\nSon, who is the chairman of Sprint, said he also wants to upgrade infrastructure to provide for faster Internet access in the U.S. He is reframing his argument for consolidation in the U.S. mobile-phone market this week to advocate for wireless broadband as an alternative to cable.\n\nPricing Strategy\n\nThe U.S. has about 200 million mobile broadband users, the highest number of all countries, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst at Chetan Sharma Consulting. Last year, average mobile data use almost doubled to 1.2 gigabytes from 690 megabytes, he said.\n\nSoftBank rose 1.6 percent to 8,098 yen at 10:30 a.m. in Tokyo trading. Sprint added 0.9 percent Monday and T-Mobile gained 0.6 percent Monday.\n\nWhen Son acquired Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s Japan unit in April 2006, the struggling carrier faced two larger rivals. He changed pricing to revive growth and upgraded networks to send video and other data.\n\nWithin six months of completing the deal, he dropped the Vodafone brand in favor of the SoftBank label, a name then best- known in Japan as the nation\u2019s second-largest Internet service provider.\n\nSoftBank Growth\n\n\u201cWhat SoftBank did in Japan was to become focused on taking costs out of the business and challenging every line item,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst at New Street Research LLC in London said March 7. \u201cThat gives them the flexibility to be more competitive on price and network.\u201d\n\nSon also made SoftBank the first Japanese carrier to offer Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone. The company tapped Hollywood stars to promote its brand, hiring actors Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones to spearhead advertising campaigns.\n\nThe moves helped. When Son bought the wireless business, it had about 15 percent of the market and 16 million subscribers. At the end of February, it had 25 percent of the market and 35 million users.\n\nSoftBank outgrew both its rivals in new users every year from 2008 to 2013, and its market value has more than quadrupled to $94.2 billion since June 2008, when the company announced it would start offering the iPhone.\n\nSon is attempting to change the public perception of a potential deal for T-Mobile, said Makoto Kikuchi, Tokyo-based chief executive officer for Myojo Asset Management Co. Consumers would welcome more price competition, he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge success for SoftBank if they use a price war as their strategy and then revive Sprint and T- Mobile,\u201d Kikuchi said.", "204": "In a television interview yesterday evening, Sprint Chairman, and SoftBank CEO, Masayoshi Son confirmed that he was interested in a deal to buy T-Mobile. The deal would combine Sprint and T-Mobile in some form of merger and help bring them in to a \u201creal fight\u201d with AT&T and Verizon. He believes a deal would create a \u201cmassive price war\u201d between the nation\u2019s four biggest carriers.\n\nOf course, he knows that a merger isn\u2019t going to be plain-sailing. And the company\u2019s interest hasn\u2019t materialized in to an official bid of any kind. But the interest is real. Seemingly, the only element hindering a potential buyout is what the regulators make of it. In early \u201ctesting the water\u201d talks with the FCC and Department of Justice, the feeling has been that neither would be entirely supportive of a buyout. SoftBank has to be able to prove that this is in the best interests of the American consumer.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing for months about a supposed bid for T-Mobile by SoftBank CEO, Masayoshi Son, but haven\u2019t heard anything officially confirming the interest. That is, until now. Both companies have \u2013 in fact \u2013 been making moves towards this deal for at least 2-3 months now. We heard that Son had approached several major banks to finance the deal, which won\u2019t be cheap. T-Mobile is now worth just under $50 billion after a very successful 2013. Deutsche Telekom \u2013 oddly \u2013 moved its T-Mobile stake to an account in the Netherlands to help with interest/value/and currency conversion, making it a more favorable deal. A similar move was made by Vodafone, shortly after the announcement was made that it would sell its 45% share in Verizon back to the American wireless carrier.\n\nThey say there\u2019s no smoke without fire. We\u2019ve been seeing the smoke for months, and now we\u2019re seeing the tips of the flame. SoftBank is interested in buying T-Mobile. That may come as bad news to Team Magenta, but I think it\u2019s worse news for Sprint. Tmo is the \u201ccool\u201d brand of the two. It\u2019s the network that\u2019s causing the biggest disturbance, both in terms of value, and what its upcoming 20+20 LTE network is capable of. It\u2019s adding as many new customers each month as Verizon, the #1 carrier. If a merger goes through, let\u2019s hope that Son decides Legere should stay on as CEO, and T-Mobile swallows up Sprint. Not the other way around.\n\nVia: WSJ", "205": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has officially put a target on the backs of AT&T and Verizon.\n\nSpeaking to Charlie Rose in an interview Monday, Son said that he'd \"like to have the real fight\" for mobile supremacy, adding that if he can get to that point, he would enter into \"a more massive price war.\"\n\nSoftBank, which acquired a controlling stake in Sprint last year, is reportedly mulling a merger with T-Mobile USA to create a more competitive alternative to the big two of AT&T and Verizon. But Son's comments suggest he also wants to undercut his competitors on price, sacrificing profits in the short term to maximize market share over the long term.\n\nSon didn't mention any plans to acquire T-Mobile, but his visit to the US this week is viewed as a lobbying trip to entice policymakers to accept such a merger. Son will be speaking in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, discussing his belief that large, competitive wireless carriers can be strong competitors to broadband providers in the consumer market. In order for his company to reach that level of competitiveness, Sprint would likely need T-Mobile's help.\n\nWhether Son can actually get a deal done, however, remains to be seen. The US government has already examined the idea of a wireless merger involving T-Mobile -- and quickly struck it down in 2011 when AT&T made a $39 billion bid for T-Mobile.

It's a three-heavyweight fight.

He goes on to confirm that he doesn't intend on selling the game and currently has no plans to make a new version, so a re-release may be the only opportunity that some people have to play the original game.\n\nThe article also touches a bit on Nguyen's initial decision to pull the \"Flappy Bird\" from virtual shelves. He says that in the days before he yanked the game, the criticism and attacks from players had started to be too much and that his parents were concerned about his health.

It's interesting to hear that Nguyen is thinking about re-releasing \"Flappy Bird\" considering all of the anger that was directed at him previously, but I'm sure that many folks would be pretty happy if he did make his game available once again. Even if he doesn't, though, I'm betting that his new offerings are going to garner quite a bit of attention when they're released due to the success that \"Flappy Bird\" enjoyed.\n\nDid you download \"Flappy Bird\" before it was pulled last month?

Dong Nguyen, the 28-year-old Hanoi, Vietnam-based game designer, is still making tens of thousands of dollars off the addictive mobile hit that pushed smartphone users to a game-playing fever pitch, as well as his other titles, Shuriken Block and Super Ball Juggling, that earned success by association.\n\nThe clones are countless; a new one was sprouting up on the App Store an average of every 24 minutes in the immediate wake of Flappy Bird's demise. Even now, three knockoffs currently sit in the top 10 of free iOS games. And announcing via Twitter that he was pulling Flappy Bird with one day's notice earned the game more than 10 million downloads in 22 hours alone.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n\"I can't go back to my life before, but I'm good now,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published Tuesday, accompanied by a picture of the chain-smoking Nguyen with his now-trademark look: clean-cut with minimalistic dress and a cigarette hanging from his mouth. But despite finally finding peace from the torrent of online abuse, criticism, and allegations of fraud, Nguyen reasserted that the decision to yank Flappy Bird from the spotlight was as much for his own mental well-being as it was for those who played his creation.\n\nNguyen detailed some of the more personal interactions with those who fell prey to the kind of addictive tendencies that game makers like King now purposefully target with Candy Crush and other top-grossing mobile hits. For instance, Nguyen was told of people who had lost their jobs, mothers who had stopped speaking with their children, and school children who had smashed their phones, all apparently because of Flappy Bird and its addictive design. It was something Nguyen never intended or asked for, and yet had no control over.\n\n\"At first I thought they were just joking,\" he said. \"But I realize they really hurt themselves.\" Nguyen pointed out that, as an avid Counter Strike fan whose grades suffered from his over-playing, he knows how games can be as addictive and destructive as any other vice, and that he hated the fact that he was putting people through that. \"Please take a break,\" a suggestion Nguyen began tweeting to obsessive Flappy Bird players in the waning days of his sparse online presence, will now accompany any future games Nguyen releases in the form of a warning message.\n\nRolling Stone's David Kushner also got Nguyen to open up about his upbringing and design influences. Nguyen revealed that he first fell in love with games by playing Super Mario Bros. on a knockoff Nintendo his parents bought for him and his brother because of the expensive nature of imported electronics, especially early GameBoys.\n\nA hand-drawn picture of Mario even sat above his desk throughout the course of the holiday weekend celebrating Reunificatifion Day, marking the end of the Vietnam War, that Nguyen spent creating Flappy Bird. The intention was simple: Make a game that could be played with one hand on the subway, and could process the simplest input -- a single tap -- anywhere on the screen, yet make it simple and incredibly difficult to get good at, like a paddle ball toy. Throwing in some nostalgic Nintendo love from his childhood, Nguyen pushed out Flappy Bird and watched as it lay dormant for months. Six months after its release, the game received its first mention on Twitter and, through a textbook instance of unexplainable virality, hit the top of the charts by the end of January.\n\nScreenshots by Nick Statt/CNET\n\nYears earlier, Nguyen spent time honing his programming, building a chess game at age 16 and, at age 19, joining Punch Entertainment, a Hanoi game studio that was a rarity for the Vietnam capital back in the early '00s. There he earned a reputation for independent thinking and coding proficiency. Nguyen echoed that assessment when asked for the defining reason he pulled Flappy Bird: \"I'm master of my own fate,\" he said. \"Independent thinker.\"\n\nIt was originally reported last month that Nguyen lived with his parents in a modest home. Now, thanks to his wealth, he's thinkng of buying his own apartment and a Mini Cooper while he stays with a friend. With his first passport and the financial cushion to quit his job, Nguyen is back to designing games, including a jetpack endless-runner variant called Kitty Jetpack and a chess game called Checkonaut.\n\nAs for an official Flappy Bird rebirth, \"I'm considering it,\" Nguyen said. Beyond that, he doesn't spend too much time thinking about the game's rise, the aftermath of its popularity explosion or the numerous clones it's still now generating, though he sees frequent offers from interested buyers. \"People can clone the app because of its simplicity,\" he said, \"but they will never make another Flappy Bird.\"", "221": "Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen dropped a surprising bombshell in an interview with Rolling Stone - he's \"considering\" bringing the game back to the App Store and Google Play.\n\nNguyen's decision is an unexpected move, considering the tone of his communication when he unceremoniously pulled the game on 9 February.\n\n\"22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this any more.\" Nguyen tweeted shortly after he complained that the \"success\" of a game \"ruins my simple life\".\n\nReturning to roost\n\nThe move by Nguyen was unthinkable - at the top of his game, and the App Store charts, he pulled the plug on a viral hit that was generating an estimated $50,000 per day.\n\nShortly after Flappy Bird's disappearance, a seemingly endless flood of clones washed over the App Store and Google Play - but none of these concern Nguyen.\n\n\"People can clone the app because of its simplicity,\" he says, \"but they will never make another Flappy Bird.\"\n\n\n\nA valuable nest egg\n\nRolling Stone also notes that the millions of Flappy Bird installs are still \"generating tens of thousands of dollars\" for Nguyen courtesy of its in-game ads.\n\nThis revenue stream has changed Nguyen - incidentally - although perhaps for the better. He's retired from his day job to focus on developing games full-time and is considering moving out from his parent's flat to his own living space.\n\nHe's even considering splurging on a Mini Cooper.\n\nBut one thing he's not considering is selling Flappy Bird or revamping it. Nguyen mused that he only change he'd include to the prospective re-release would be a \"warning\" on Flappy Bird that reminds players to \"please take a break\".\n\n[source: Rolling Stone]", "222": "Remember when game developer Dong Nguyen got so fed up with the attention his simple sidescroller Flappy Bird was getting that he deleted it from app stores entirely? Yeah, maybe he\u2019s changed his mind. Not getting $50,000 dollars a day in ad revenue will do that to a person, we guess.\n\nAccording to his recent interview with Rolling Stone, Nguyen is \u201cconsidering\u201d bringing the game back online, with one added caveat: that the game would now tell players to take breaks after they\u2019ve been at it for extended periods of time. Please, like anyone will listen to that. Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds practically begged me to stop playing it, and did I listen? No sir.\n\nNguyen first removed the game from the iTunes app store and Google Play after he became concerned that players were too addicted to getting that bird to flap between those pipes. Which doesn\u2019t necessarily seem fair, considering that he designed the game to be played one-handed on long train rides. Maybe he was worried that those commuters were all missing their stops due to Flappy Bird? Still, Nguyen definitely didn\u2019t deserve the insane amounts of criticism he got for the game in the first place, so we understand his desire to remove himself from the spotlight. He just better not expect anyone to get as excited about the game as they once did if it does return.

He said that the future of Hanoi influenced the gameplay. People rushing through the streets of Hanoi, transfixed on their phones, led to the simple tap control of the game.\n\nHe said the scoring for the game was influenced by \"one of the most masocore analog creations ever: paddleball.\"\n\nSince taking Flappy Bird down Nguyen said he felt relief. \"I can't go back to my life before, but I'm good now,\" he said.\n\n[Rolling Stone]", "228": "Almost exactly a month after Flappy Bird maker Dong Nguyen took down his surprisingly viral hit from the iOS App Store (launching a tidal wave of clones in the process), the reclusive developer has said that he is \"considering\" putting the game up for download once more.\n\nRolling Stone scored a rare interview with Nguyen, who has shunned the spotlight since becoming something of an Internet celebrity in the wake of Flappy Bird's sudden rise and fall (from the iOS store at least). The mention of a potential App Store return for Flappy Bird comes near the end of the story, though Nguyen says the game would come back with a warning: \"Please take a break.\" (That's an entreaty Wii Sports owners are quite familiar with). The game's return would likely be greeted warmly by those not among the tens of millions who downloaded the game before it was taken down, though not as warmly by those trying to sell Flappy Bird equipped phones for thousands.\n\nIn the new interview, Nguyen follows up on previously discussed worries that the game he created became an \"addictive product\" that was harming people through overuse. He told the magazine that he suffered in school from an addiction to Counter-Strike, and Nguyen shared some distressing messages of similar addiction that he received since the game became a hit. \"Thirteen kids at my school broke their phones because of your game, and they still play it cause it's addicting like crack,\" one message read.\n\nNguyen also addressed how Flappy Bird's success ruined the \"simple life\" he enjoyed living with his parents in Vietnam. He even had to move in with a friend when his parents' house was swarmed by local paparazzi and reporters. Those parents knew nothing of their son's viral success\u2014and the estimated ad payments of $50,000 a day\u2014until the reporters came calling, apparently. \"My parents don't understand games,\" he said.\n\nAs for the game's design inspiration, Nguyen, who once cranked out sports games for a Vietnamese mobile game developer, cites the familiar children's paddle ball toy. It's incredibly simple to use but tough to keep going for more than a couple of hits. This simplicity is key for the mobile gaming environment, he said, where players usually just have one thumb to use. \"When you play game on a smartphone, the simplest way is just tapping.\"\n\nThough it felt \"amazing\" to see his game on top of the App Store charts, Nguyen said he \"couldn't be too happy\" with the success. \"I don't know why,\" he said. Since taking the game down, though, he describes a feeling of relief. \"I can't go back to my life before, but I'm good now.\"", "229": "Despite once offering a comment about how Flappy Bird is \u201cgone forever\u201d \u2014 the developer, Dong Nguyen, may be ready to consider otherwise. The statements from Nguyen certainly don\u2019t suggest that Flappy Bird will return to the Play Store soon, however he did open the door for the possibility. In speaking with Rolling Stone, Nguyen mentioned how he is \u201cconsidering it.\u201d\n\nNguyen also made if clear that is Flappy Bird were to return, it would do so with a warning that reminds players to \u201cplease take a break.\u201d As it seemed the addictive nature of the original Flappy Bird release was one of the reasons he pulled the game, we could see Nguyen working something in that forces players to take a break. Some sort of built-in game timer where you only get so many of minutes per hour.\n\nThis bit, along with quite a bit more of the story is all covered in detail. Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen spoke with David Kushner, of the previously mentioned Rolling Stone. Some of the story will likely sound a bit familiar to those who had been following closely, however there are plenty of gems still included. You learn a little bit about him, and also a little bit about why he decided to create this game.\n\nNguyen mentioned how he wanted to create a game for someone like himself \u2014 busy and always on the go. To that point, he said he pictured how people would be playing with one hand holding the device up in the air, and the other holding the strap on the train. Hence the easy one-handed game play that was found with Flappy Bird. He also made it clear he was only trying to make \u201csomething fun to share with other people\u201d and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t predict the success.\u201d", "230": "Now that Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen has enjoyed a month out of the spotlight, he\u2019s thinking about bringing back his hit game, and releasing some new ones.\n\nRolling Stone\u2019s David Kushner managed to track down Nguyen in his home town of Hanoi, Vietnam, where he\u2019s been hiding out at a friend\u2019s house and dodging most media requests. And apparently, he\u2019s feeling a lot better now:\n\nSince taking Flappy Bird down, he says he\u2019s felt \u201crelief. I can\u2019t go back to my life before, but I\u2019m good now.\u201d As for the future of his flapper, he\u2019s still turning down offers to purchase the game. Nguyen refuses to compromise his independence. But will Flappy Bird ever fly again? \u201cI\u2019m considering it,\u201d Nguyen says. He\u2019s not working on a new version, but if he ever releases one it will come with a \u201cwarning,\u201d he says: \u201cPlease take a break.\u201d\n\nKushner also got a glimpse at a few new games Nguyen is working on, including a cowboy-themed shooter, an \u201caction chess\u201d game and a vertical flying game called Kitty Jetpack. He plans to release one of the games this month.\n\nThe entire story is worth a read if you\u2019re obsessed with Flappy Bird and were baffled by its sudden disappearance from the iOS App Store and Google Play. Here\u2019s one more snippet, which explains how Nguyen took a previous game, Shuriken Block, and stripped the idea down further so players didn\u2019t have to look at where they tapped on the screen.\n\nHe modeled the game on one of the most masocore analog creations ever: paddleball. The toy was a simple design \u2013 just a wooden paddle with a string attached to a rubber ball. But players would be lucky to bounce the ball more than a few times in a row. Like paddleball, he limited his game to just a couple of elements \u2013 the bird and the pipes \u2013 and resisted the usual urge to lard the action with new elements as the player progressed. He tuned the physics so that the bird was fighting gravity so strong, even the slightest wrong tap would kill it.\n\nNguyen didn\u2019t just accidentally make a brilliant game. He iterated until he had something that deserved its viral success.\n\nMORE: The History of Video Game Consoles \u2013 Full\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "231": "News\n\nGoogle Courting Cloud Apps Users with Referral Program Launch\n\nGoogle on Monday kicked off a referral program to promote its Google Apps for Business product in U.S. and Canadian markets.\n\nUnder the terms of the program, Google will pay $15 per subscriber for a total of up to $1,500 per customer entity to get the referrals.\n\nGoogle recently hosted more than 700 partners at its Global Partner Summit, but the referral program is open to anyone, not just partners.

Get the Guide.\n\nGoogle on Monday launched a referral program for its office apps. It will hand out $15 referral bonuses to Google Apps customers who convince new users to sign up for the service.\n\nWord-of-mouth praise already has attracted many new users for services including Gmail for businesses, Google Calendar, Docs, Slides, Hangouts and Google Drive, Google said -- and it wants to keep that spirit of sharing alive.\n\nHow It Works\n\nGoogle therefore will award the $15 bonus for up to 100 new user referrals. A \"user\" refers to an individual account belonging in the customer domain. So, for example, if you were to convince a business with 125 users to sign up for a Google Apps account, you would be rewarded for 100 of those new users.\n\nReferring customers also will be able to offer new account holders coupons to save $10 per user for the first year. The referrers will receive more of those coupons as they continue to refer, according to Google.\n\nIn order to participate, referrers must reside in the U.S. or Canada, and they must give Google a valid taxpayer ID and bank account information for a direct deposit. There is no limit to the number of people they can refer, but the bonus amount will be based on the number of users who have paid for the service for at least 120 days.\n\nLow-Risk Experiment\n\nReferral programs sometimes can be an effective way to haul in new customers, but in this case, the bonus might be going to the wrong people, said Dave Michels, principal analyst at TalkingPointz.\n\n\"Most referral programs are aimed at consumer products or services and work because they tap into personal networks of influence,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"I doubt such a program will be that effective for Google, because the Google Apps decision is typically made by IT leadership. The general population doesn't have much influence over IT decision makers.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean it won't bring in any new customers, but it could be more limited than Google is hoping, said Frank Ohlhorst, IT business consultant and analyst at GigaOM.\n\n\"Google's referral program is bound to generate some business for the company,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"However, it seems that ... small businesses will benefit the most from it -- and those businesses have very limited reach to other businesses that will adopt Google Apps. Perhaps a better approach would be to offer small businesses free services that are driven by ad revenue and then, for a fee, eliminate the ads.\"\n\nStill, Google has the pockets to experiment with this and could be in the process of learning more about how to snag some new users via referrals, Michels added.\n\n\"Google is great at experimenting, and really there isn't much risk here,\" he pointed out. \"If it works, they are happy, and if it fails, that's OK too.\"\n\nTaking On Microsoft\n\nIf it does fail, the company will need to be more creative in taking on Microsoft Office and Office 365, the primary competition to Google's productivity suite, said J. Gerry Purdy, chief mobility analyst at Compass Intelligence.\n\n\"The interesting thing to me is that this is just a referral program -- not a conversion or trade-in or some mechanism to get folks to essentially give up using Office,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\n\nThe problem with a more competitive campaign to win new users is that pitting Google Apps directly against Microsoft's Office products could be a grim reminder that Google has very big shoes to fill if it wants to take on the established giant in the space. Improving the product would be a better way to attract new users than a referral program will be, said Michels.\n\n\"Google Apps has always been positioned against Office as a simpler product for less money,\" he noted. \"The problem is Microsoft has narrowed the price gap, so a simpler solution for about the same price doesn't play well -- plus several popular features are still missing from Google Apps. Google has some nice advantages around multi-user collaboration, but unless Google picks up the pace, Microsoft is likely to eliminate Google's advantages.\"\n\nRachelle Dragani is a freelance reporter based in Brooklyn, NY.

In a blog posting on March 10th Prajesh Parekh, a Google marketing lead, wrote \"we\u2019re offering a $15 referral bonus for each new Google Apps user you refer.\"\n\nWell, that's one way to get customers!\n\nGoogle Apps for Business is a cloud-based office suite. It consists of Gmail; Google Calendar; Google Drive; Google Docs; Slides, a PowerPoint-like presentation manager; and Sheets, Google's answer to Excel. There's also Google Apps for Business with Vault. This last program adds e-mail archiving for e-discovery to Google Apps. For some businesses this is a legal requirement.\n\nGoogle Apps for Business costs $5 a month per user or $50 a year for users. There is no limit to the number of users you can have on this service. Google Apps for Business with Vault costs $10 a month.\n\nThere are also some third-party apps, such as Insightly, a small-business customer relationship management (CRM) program , that you can use with Google Apps. In addition, some Google programs, such as Hangouts for video-conferencing and Google Voice, a VoIP (Voice-over-Internet Protocol) , are often used with Google Apps for Business even though they don't come as \"official' parts of the office suite.\n\nParekh said, \"When we discover something amazing \u2013 whether it\u2019s a new local coffee shop or a tool that improves the way we work \u2013 we want to share it with people we know so they can also benefit.\"\n\n\"For those of us who use Google Apps, the ability to access all of our documents from anywhere on any device and being able to seamlessly collaborate with colleagues or customers across the world, are impressive moments,\" continued Parekh. \"These are moments we want to share with friends and colleagues because the more the people in our networks use Google Apps, the more seamlessly we can collaborate with them -- whether it\u2019s video conferencing via Hangouts, working together on Docs or sharing calendars. Best of all, it means we can all begin to experience a new way of working.\"\n\nTo encourage users to share to the \"joys\" of Google Apps, Parekh wrote, \"To help continue the momentum, we\u2019re launching the Google Apps Referral Program. The referral program makes it easy to share Google Apps with your network and show them how they too can use these tools at work.\" This program is only available to users in the US and Canada. \"To show our appreciation, we\u2019re offering a $15 referral bonus for each new Google Apps user you refer.\"\n\nThe fine print makes Google Apps referrals sounds like a pretty good deal. You'll get $15 per user, and you\u2019re rewarded for each referral customer\u2019s first 100 users. A user is an individual account belonging to the customer domain. So, if you got a business to sign up with 100 users you'd get $1,500. Not bad, not bad at all!\n\nYour earnings are paid directly to your bank account. Users that save your referrals will get coupons that will save them $10 per user for the first year. Believe it or not, you can refer an unlimited number of customers. To keep people honest, your referral amount will be based on the number of users who have paid for at least 120 days. So, you can forget about setting up FlyByNightRipOff.com and trying to trick Google into paying you heaps of money.\n\nI must say that this sounds like a very attractive deal to me, and I'm sure it will to many other Google apps users as well.\n\nSome people have already wondered how on earth it can be worth $15 a customer for Google. The answer is that even if you don't assume users will stay on a few years at $50 a year, or $5 a month at the low end, Google should be profiting after the first three months of paid use. And as I pointed out, to get the $15 payout they'll actually need to be paying customers for four months. This only look like a loss leader.

Therapy at these earlier stages would be more effective at slowing or preventing the onset of symptoms. The researchers say that their study is the first known report of blood-based biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nTen lipids, or fats, that predict disease are identified in the blood by the new test, which could be ready for use in clinical trials in as little as two years. The researchers are hopeful for other diagnostic uses as well.\n\n\u201cOur novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,\u201d says Howard J. Federoff, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.\n\nTo date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Approximately 35.6 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), that number will double every 20 years. They predict 115.4 million sufferers by 2050.\n\nThere have been many efforts to develop drug therapies to slow or reverse the disease\u2019s progression, but according to Federoff, all have failed so far. He believes that one reason for this failure is that the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process.\n\n\u201cThe preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,\u201d Federoff says. \u201cBiomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe researchers recruited 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older. The participants all gave blood samples at the beginning of the study and at various points during the study. Over the five-year study period, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Forty-six of this group were diagnosed upon enrollment in the study and 28 (called converters) developed aMCI or mild AD during the study.\n\nDuring the study\u2019s third year, 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls were selected for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. The lipids were not the initial focus of the study; instead, they were an outcome.\n\nThe researchers discovered a panel of 10 lipids that appear to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in study participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD. The team validated the panel using the remaining 21 aMCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls. To determine if the subjects could be characterized into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the panel of 10 lipids identified in the discovery phase, the data was analyzed blind.\n\n\u201cThe lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,\u201d Federoff says.\n\nThe research team also investigated the possibility that the APOE4 gene, known to be a risk factor for developing AD, would contribute to accurate classifications of the groups. They found it was not a significant predictive factor, however.\n\n\u201cWe consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,\u201d Federoff says. \u201cWe\u2019re designing a clinical trial where we\u2019ll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "251": "For the first time, a test that detects 10 types of lipids, or fats, circulating in a person's blood has been shown to predict accurately whether he or she will develop the memory loss and mental decline of Alzheimer's disease over the next two to three years. A screening test based on the findings could be available in as little as two years, said the researchers who identified the blood biomarkers.\n\nThe effort to identify predictors of Alzheimer's disease that are reliable, easy and inexpensive to detect was described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine. Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's could make it possible to identify those at risk before they develop symptoms, the authors suggested.\n\nWhile no treatments for Alzheimer's have proven effective in slowing or reversing its progress, the authors declared that earlier detection may open new treatment options. Interventions to head off or slow cognitive decline before it is evident might be more effective than intervening later, when dementia has already set in.\n\nThe researchers \u2014 from the University of Rochester, Georgetown University and the University of California, Irvine \u2014 did not start with a list of possible biomarkers, but recruited 525 subjects at least 70 years old. The team scoured their blood for possibilities while waiting to see which subjects would develop dementia symptoms.\n\nForty-six subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease upon entry into the study. And 28 went on to develop mild Alzheimer's or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often progresses to full-blown Alzheimer's. The researchers compared the blood of 53 of those 74 subjects with that of 53 matched subjects who had developed no cognitive abnormalities. The analysis allowed them to identify measurable differences between the groups in 10 different lipids.\n\nThe 10 lipids identified as harbingers of Alzheimer's appear to be the result of the breakdown of neural cell membranes, a process that accelerates as the disease takes hold.\n\nOnce they had the list of revealing lipids, the study authors gathered 41 of their recruits: 21 who had developed early Alzheimer's in the course of the study and 20 who had not. Blinded to the subjects' status, the researchers tried to see if they could use the 10-lipids panel to sort the subjects correctly on the basis of their blood tests alone. They found they could do so, with over 90 per cent accuracy.\n\nThat's an accuracy level on a par with tests that measure the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of abnormal proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. But because a blood test would be much cheaper and less invasive than a spinal tap, it would make screening large populations of people far more practical.\n\nAmong the issues still to be sorted out: how revealing the 10-lipids blood panel would be in a larger and more diverse population of patients; and how sensitive and specific such a screen would be. Many tests are able to identify 100 per cent of people who are sick with a particular disease (they're highly sensitive), but they also falsely identify many as sick who are not (they're not very specific).\n\nIf patients test positive for impending Alzheimer's, many may accept treatments that are expensive and risky in a bid to head it off. As a result, it's important to establish that the 10-lipids test does not have a very high \"false positive\" rate.", "252": "Blood test to predict Alzheimer's\n\n10th March 2014\n\nDementia affects 44 million people globally, a figure that is set to treble by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout intervention this could be reflected in a rise of the \u00a3370b that is currently spent worldwide per year.\n\nAlzheimer's can attack the brain for more than a decade before any symptoms reveal themselves. It has been suggested that the drug trials are failing because the patients are being treated too late to make a difference.\n\nScientific breakthroughs have the potential to transform medical research and allowing drugs to be tested at a much earlier, critical stage.\n\nWhat has been discovered?\n\nScientists at Georgetown University in Washington DC analysed blood samples from 525 people over the age of 70 as part of a five-year study. They tested the blood of 53 of those who developed Alzheimer's or a mild cognitive impairment and compared it to those who stayed mentally agile.\n\nThe found differences in the levels of 10 lipids (fats) between the two groups. They showed that measuring the levels of these fats in people will allow them to predict - with 90% accuracy - the risk of the onset of the disease three years in advance, with potential for even earlier.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what is causing the change in fats in the blood, but it could be a residue of the early changes in the brain.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature Medicine, will now be tested in larger clinical trials.\n\n\n\nHoward Federoff, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, told the BBC: \"I think there is a huge need for a test.\n\nDr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were \"encouraging\" and that a blood test would be a \"real step forward\".\n\n\"If confirmed, these results could also aid efforts to develop better tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's - allowing people with the disease to access crucial support and existing treatments sooner.\"", "253": "\n\nAndrea Janus, CTVNews.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers in the United States say they have developed a blood test that can predict with more than 90 per cent accuracy whether someone will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease within three years.\n\nDr. Howard J.

The blood test identifies ten lipids, or fats, that predict disease onset.\n\nFor their study, the researchers enrolled 525 healthy subjects aged 70 and older who gave blood at the outset and at regular intervals. Over five years, 74 subjects met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), the main symptom of which is memory loss.\n\nComparing 53 of these subjects against the same number of cognitively normal subjects, the researchers discovered the ten lipids that they say revealed the breakdown of neural cell membranes in those that developed symptoms of cognitive impairment.\n\nThe discovery of the lipids was confirmed in the remaining subjects who developed either Alzheimer\u2019s or aMCI against the same number of controls.\n\n\u201cThe lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,\u201d Federoff said.\n\nThe researchers say their study is the first that identifies blood-based biomarkers that predict Alzheimer\u2019s. However, the test may not be ready for use in clinical studies for another two years.\n\nIdentifying patients who are most likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s could help scientists develop prevention and treatment methods that will delay, or perhaps even prevent, disease development. The team is designing a clinical trial to identify high-risk subjects in order to test just such a drug.\n\nThe findings are published in the April edition of the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nLisa Loiselle, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher at the University of Waterloo, says that if the test proves 100-per-cent accurate, it \u201ccould be very, very valuable.\u201d\n\nHowever, she told CTV News Channel Monday that she has some reservations about the study, including that the subjects were all 70 or older.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who are 70 years of age and older generally have higher risk factors for developing dementia to begin with,\u201d Loiselle said. \u201cThose who are older also have a higher lipid count in their blood. So we have to take that into perspective.\u201d\n\nLoiselle said she would like to see the study\u2019s results replicated in patients under age 70.\n\nIn his video statement, Federoff notes that more than 35 million people suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s around the world, and by the middle of this century that figure is expected to balloon to more than 100 million.\n\nUp to now, drugs that have been developed to slow the onset of disease have largely failed, but that could be because they were tested in patients who were already diagnosed; in other words, too late.\n\n\u201cThe preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,\u201d Federoff said. \u201cBiomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.\u201d", "254": "A new blood test is reported to be able to identify people in their 70s who are likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease within 3 years, with at least a 90 percent accuracy.\n\nThis study is the first of its kind and can change how science predicts Alzheimer\u2019s or other cognitive impairments in patients.\n\nThe test is the first that identifies blood-based bio-markers to predict the disease, and may be ready for use in clinical studies within two years.\n\nAbout 500 healthy subjects aged 70 and older gave blood at the outset and at regular intervals.

Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nIt is not a normal part of aging.\n\nWhen compared to the blood of normal test subjects, about ten lipids were identified that reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in those people who developed symptoms of cognitive impairment.\n\nDr. Howard J.

Would you want that information? Would the fact there is currently no cure or preventative treatment have an impact on your decision?\n\nThese are some of the questions raised by a recent study that suggests a seemingly straightforward blood test might be able to predict, with 90 per cent accuracy, the onset of Alzheimer's. Over the past few days, news outlets throughout the world have hailed this research as a \"breakthrough\" that could lead to treatments that, as one article stated, could \"halt or even prevent the disease.\"\n\nThis is, no doubt, a potentially exciting development. The test, which measures the level of a variety of lipids in the blood, may help inform both research strategies and, one can hope, future therapies.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStill, we need to be cautious and resist the \"breakthrough\" mentality so pervasive in popular culture today. This is one study. And it is not a terribly large one. Nor is the predictive power as precise as often reported in the media (for example, the 90 per cent prediction refers to the onset of both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease \u2013 two very different outcomes). The results of the study are promising, but we need to take great care not to over-interpret or overreact.\n\nHistory tells us that biomarkers are often not as prognostic as suggested by early research results. Indeed, a 2012 paper by Stanford University's John Ioannidis concluded that, despite the large investment in biomarker research \u2013 such as genetics testing, body and tissue imaging and the measurement of particular chemicals in the blood \u2013 \"the yield of successful biomarkers with unquestionably favorable health impacts has been extremely limited to date.\" Other work by Mr. Ioannidis has found that the predictive power of biomarkers is often exaggerated in the scientific literature, thus making it difficult for clinicians to judge their true value.\n\nSo, when faced with the prospect of an exciting new test, such as this one for Alzheimer's disease, we should remind ourselves to wait for the results of methodologically rigorous studies that replicate the initial findings.\n\nMoreover, a consideration of the social and individual impact of the test needs to be weighed and investigated.\n\nFirst, it is unclear that the likely onset of Alzheimer's is something that all individuals would want to know, particularly since there is nothing that can be done to prevent or cure this fatal condition. While there is survey research that suggests a strong interest in this kind of technology (perhaps people will want to get things done prior to arrival of symptoms), experience with other predictive tests gives us some hint as to how the uptake might actually play out. A genetic test for Huntington's disease, for example, has been around for decades. If an individual tests positive for the relevant genetic mutation, the future development of the disease is a virtual certainty. In other words, the test is 100 per cent predictive.\n\nBut despite the power of the test, only 10 to 20 per cent of individuals at risk for Huntington's \u2013 that is, individuals with a family history \u2013 actually get tested. The majority of individuals simply don't want to know what the future holds.\n\nSecond, there are questions about how individuals and our health system might react to this information. Would a positive result cause anxiety and, perhaps, enduring psychological harm? Research tells us that humans are, in fact, remarkably resilient to even the most distressing news. But it seems certain that at least some individuals would struggle with the prospect of imminent cognitive decline \u2013 a fact that seems particularly salient given that there would likely be a significant number of false positives.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd what impact might a test of this nature have on our health care system? Even inexpensive tests can have significant downstream costs.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is devastating. It is understandable that news of a noteworthy advance would result in hopeful headlines and predictions of near future application. Indeed, I too am hopeful that research of this nature will lead to effective tests, preventive strategies and, even, treatments.\n\nBut the announcement of and reaction to this study also highlights the need for caution in the interpretation of results, carefully executed replication studies and a consideration of the cascade of individual and social costs so often associated with potentially powerful medical advances.\n\nThere is a lot at stake. Let's get it right.\n\nTimothy Caulfield holds the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, is a Trudeau Fellow and is the author of The Cure for Everything: Untangling the Twisted Messages about Health, Fitness and Happiness (2012).", "257": "(Medical Xpress)\u2014A study involving Rochester-area seniors has yielded the first accurate blood test that can predict who is at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. This discovery \u2013 which appears today in the journal Nature Medicine \u2013 could be the key to unlocking a new generation of treatments that seek to head off the disease before neurological damage becomes irreversible.\n\nThe biomarker \u2013 which consists of 10 specific lipids found in blood plasma \u2013 predicted with greater than 90 percent accuracy which individuals would go on to develop Alzheimer's disease or a precursor condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The cost of the simple blood test required to detect these lipids is a fraction of other techniques and, unlike alternatives, it identifies risk early in the disease process before cognitive symptoms appears.\n\n\"The ability to identify individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment has long been a Holy Grail of the neuromedicine community,\" said Mark Mapstone, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and lead author of the study. \"Current efforts to develop a treatment for this disease are coming up short because they are probably being used too late. Biomarkers that can allow us to intervene early in the course of the disease could be a game-changer.\"\n\nAlzheimer's research is at an impasse with many once promising experimental therapies failing in late stage clinical trials. These setbacks have led all but a few major pharmaceutical companies to pull back from their research and development in the disease.\n\nThe absence of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's, and the dwindling options in the drug development pipeline, mean that the nation \u2013 and the world \u2013 are woefully unprepared for the coming \"Silver Tsunami\" of aging baby boomers who will develop the disease in the coming years. By 2050, an estimated 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer's, consuming an estimated $1.2 trillion in health care costs per year.\n\nThere is an emerging scientific consensus that once the cognitive symptoms of the Alzheimer's have emerged, it may be too late to slow or reverse the neurological damage caused by the disease. Researchers speculate that if treatments could be initiated early in the disease cycle, they may stand more of a chance of being effective. In fact, many of the same experimental treatments that have failed in recent clinical studies may ultimately prove to be successful if they are given to patients sooner. The challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nThere are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer's disease. These include spinal taps which measure the presence of the proteins beta amyloid and tau and advanced imaging systems such as MRIs, PET scans, and functional MRIs that spot changes in the brain. But these techniques have significant limitations. First, they have only been shown to be effective in confirming the diagnosing of the diseases after the cognitive symptoms have surfaced. And second, the high cost associated with these technologies is a significant barrier to widespread use in clinical practice.\n\nThe Rochester Aging Study, which was launched in 2007, is a community-wide collaboration that involves physicians and researchers from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Unity Health, and Rochester General Health System.\n\nIn total, 425 seniors from the Rochester area participated in the study. The volunteers underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and a blood draw once a year over a five-year period. An additional 100 individuals from Irvine, CA were enrolled in the study.\n\nResearchers at the University of Rochester and Georgetown University used a technique called mass spectrometry to screen for lipid levels in blood plasma. Lipids are a class of naturally occurring molecules found in the body that play a role in energy storage, signaling, and form the structural components of cell membranes. The scientists identified 10 specific lipids that, if present in lower than normal levels, could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy whether an individual would go on to develop either Alzheimer's or aMCI.\n\nThe scientists are not entirely sure why this particular set of lipids is indicative of Alzheimer's. All ten represent a class of lipids called phospholipids, molecules that are important cellular building blocks. The researchers speculate that the lower lipid levels could be an early indication that the brain cells lost in the disease are beginning to lose their integrity and break down.\n\nOnce commercialized, a blood test required to detect these lipids would likely cost less than $200 \u2013 compared to thousands of dollars for a spinal tap or MRI \u2013 and could be ordered as a part of a routine exam by an individual's primary care physician.\n\n\"Having a tool that is able to identify, with a high degree of accuracy and at a low cost, which individuals will convert to Alzheimer's could transform how we care for this devastating disease,\" said Mapstone.\n\nExplore further: Blood test identifies those at-risk for cognitive decline, Alzheimer's within three years", "258": "A new blood test has been developed that may be able to tell people whether or not they will develop Alzheimer's disease. Ten molecules in blood would be used to predict about the disease and the test is said to have 90% accuracy.\n\nThe test is one-of-its-kind as it will be able to tell who are having pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease and have not developed symptoms of it and others who will not develop the condition.\n\nResearchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants who were aged 70 and above. They were monitored for five years. During the research, the scientists discovered 10 molecules that revealed about the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who are going to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMimi Lowi-Young, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of Canada said results of the test can be far-reaching. \"You need to understand what the impact is around personal decisions, relationships with family, what impact it will have on family, children, finances and so on\", said Young.\n\nThe development of the test has raised a number of other questions as it is better to aware of the disease when there is limited medication available for the same that has limited effect.\n\nTimothy Caulfield from the University of Alberta said further research is requires on the matter before they move forward. If the result is confirmed by carrying a wide study having different sections of people then the blood test can change the way the disease is diagnosed.\n\nChances will increase to provide early medication to people, which will further help in avoiding significant cognitive decline. The study has been published in the Nature Medicine.", "259": "A new blood test developed by scientists from Georgetown University in Washington DC is capable of predicting onset of Alzheimer's with 96 per cent certainty three years in advance\u2014and that figure could soon stretch to decades.\n\nThe researchers report their new test in Nature Medicine, explaining that it identifies 10 chemicals in the blood which are associated with the disease. While tests already exist to diagnose the condition, this is the first to predict its onset.\n\nThe test was developed using a group of 525 people aged 70 and over, who initially showed no signs of mental impairment. They were given cognitive tests over a five year period, and also had blood samples taken. Over the five years, 28 developed Alzheimer's\u2014enough to identify the 10 chemicals which indicated the presence of the disease.\n\nIn subsequent trials, the presence of those chemicals in blood samples has been used to predict the onset of Alzheimer's within three years, with up to 96 per cent certainty. The next step is to make the test even more sensitive\u2014and the researchers hope that it could then be used to predict the onset of the disease 10 or 20 years in advance.\n\nThe only question then is: would you actually want to know?

Federoff, executive vice president of health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, said one reason drugs have failed to slow or reverse the disease could be that the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process. That may change, he said, with the new blood test.\n\n\n\n\"This is the first time a highly sensitive and specific test has been able to predict who will become demented,\" he told NBC News.\n\n\n\nDr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, told NBC the study addresses a \"critical need in the field\" to find an inexpensive and relatively easy way to screen large groups of people.\n\n\n\n\"This step is an important step in that direction but needs to be validated on a larger group of subjects more representative of a more general aging population,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer's experts not involved in the research stressed the preliminary nature of the findings but said that they provide hope that tests in clinics could soon be available.\n\n\"It is interesting and exciting,\" Dr. Mary Sano, director of the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai Hospital, told ABC News. \"But more work has to be done.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimer's Association, told the network the next hurdle is getting a reliable test that can be widely used.\n\n\"It is intriguing research, but it is still too preliminary for use in the doctor's office,\" she said. She added, however, that the quest for a simple blood test to look for signs of early disease is crucial.", "261": "A new blood test can accurately predict if a person will develop a mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease within the next three years, a new study found.\n\nUsing blood-based biomarkers, the test identifies 10 fats in the bloodstream that can determine onset of the disease with 90 percent accuracy.\n\nAbout 35.6 million people suffer from Alzheimer's, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and the number will double every 20 years. There is no cure, but this simple test could lead to other diagnostic tools.\n\n\"Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,\" said Dr. Howard J. Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, in a statement.\n\nResearchers took blood samples from 525 healthy participants over 70 years of age, and found that 74 of them developed Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another disease, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Also, unbeknownst to the study's team, they would discover the 10 lipids, or fats, that determine the onset of these cognitive diseases. They found that these fats reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD.\n\nThe APOE4 gene is also a known risk factor for developing Alzheimer's, and was investigated in the study. But its presence had not effect, positive or negative, on the blood test. This blood test actually better predicted dementia risk than the APOE4 test alone.\n\nCurrently PET scans or MRIs are used to diagnose dementia, but this new blood test is less expensive and much easier to administer.\n\n\"Blood-based biomarkers would be a great and useful option -- more accessible, less invasive, easier to gather and less expensive to process,\" Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association said in a Philly report. \"Several are under development for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. More research investment in this area is urgently needed.\"", "262": "A new blood test that can predict cognitive decline is a small but promising step in Alzheimer\u2019s research that could eventually help doctors attack the debilitating disease early, experts say.\n\n\u201cWe desperately need some inexpensive test to help us predict Alzheimer\u2019s, and a blood test would be perfect,\u201d said Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nResearchers at Georgetown University announced a test this week that is ?90 percent accurate at predicting if a healthy person will develop dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s within three years.\n\nThere is little people can do to delay or prevent Alzheimer\u2019s now, but tests like these, coupled with trials of drugs that can treat the disease early, could eventually make Alzheimer\u2019s preventable, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cWe have to have this dual approach to our research right now, which is working on new methods of early diagnosis and new methods of intervening early,\u201d said Dr. Robert Stern, director of clinical research at Boston University\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans now have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a deadly form of dementia. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association expects that number to triple by 2050. The cost of the disease is also expected to increase to $1.2 trillion by 2050, from more than $200 billion.\n\nThe blood test could help determine who should get more expensive tests, such as spinal taps and PET scans, said Sperling, who is leading a big national study on Alzheimer\u2019s prevention.\n\nSaid Sperling, \u201cThis is the way we will get answers.\u201d", "263": "Every day, police in the Kansas City metro area are inundated with calls to handle mental illness emergencies.\n\n\"Usually more than one time a day,\u201d says Don Ash, sheriff of Wyandotte County, Kan. \u201cCalls could come in from a family member. Calls could come in from the general public. From a business owner.\u201d\n\nSomeone might be picked up for something as simple as loitering or trespassing, and even though it might clearly a mental health emergency, police typically have little choice but to take them to jail or possibly an emergency room.\n\nBut a new facility in the works in Kansas City, Kan., raises hope that local police will soon a better option.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback announced Jan. 23 that a former state psychiatric hospital near the University Of Kansas Hospital, which has been mostly mothballed during the past few years, is being converted into a mental crisis stabilization facility.\n\nA Department of Justice report shows that nearly two-thirds of jail inmates in have some kind of mental health problem. Some have committed real crimes, but many have not.\n\nAsh believes taking these people to jail is not a great way to deal with a crisis, and it taps police resources.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not available to be doing what the public truly expects them to be doing, and that is really dealing with suppressing crime or investigating crime,\" Ash said.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that this is gonna be one of the most helpful and significant changes in the mental health system and its delivery in this state over the past, even couple of decades,\u201d Brownback said when he announced the facility in Kansas City, Kan.\n\nThe Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan., has been all but empty since being cited for safety violations and staffing concerns in 2011. It will reopen April 1 as the first of the new 24/7 crisis stabilization centers in Kansas. Patients might stay a few hours or a few weeks. The new facility will have 10 longer-stay beds, compare to 50 beds in the previous Rainbow incarnation.\n\nMany involved in mental health agree the new facility could make a big difference, but see it just one step forward after years of falling behind on supporting mental illness.\n\n\"There's been a steady erosion over the past seven, eight years on both sides of the state line,\" Susan Crain Lewis, President and CEO of Mental Health America of the Heartland, says of mental illness funding in the state.\n\n\"It\u2019s not been a question of \u2018let\u2019s get something more\u2019 it\u2019s like \u2018how can we hold on to the bare minimum?\u2019\u201d\n\nState grants were created in the early 1990s to fund community mental health centers in Kansas. That funding was cut in 2008-09 and has fluctuated since then. The state attributes recent cuts to lower Medicaid caseloads.\n\nMissouri has also seen significant cuts for safety net services: about $17 million since 2010.\n\nLewis says those cuts have meant the uninsured and underinsured can\u2019t get the help they need.\n\n\u201cThe minute you can\u2019t go to your doctor for any amount of time, you get sicker,\u201d says Lewis.\n\nMany advocates trace a new interest in funding mental health to the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when a 20-year-old man who may have had a mental illness killed 26 people.\n\n\u201cYou always hate that it takes something like that for us to start paying attention to thing we know we need to be doing, but it did - I think - change the concentration on this issues,\u201d says Brent McGinty, President and CEO of the Missouri Coalition of Community Mental Health Centers.\n\nMcGinty says that in the last year, the Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and legislature have done a lot more for mental health, with programs like the \u201cStrengthening Mental Health\u201d initiative.\n\nAbout a month after the Sandy Hook shooting, Gov. Brownback announced plans for a new Kansas mental health strategy. He said he would channel $10 million into a regional mental health hub system.\n\nBrownback's new mental health strategy includes the rehabilitation of the Rainbow Mental Health Facility, and Sheriff Ash says it will make a difference.\n\n\u201cI believe we will start to see a reduction in some of these people that we see, or that we see on a regular basis,\u201d Ash explains.\n\nSusan Crain Lewis is optimistic, but cautious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge help, but it doesn\u2019t solve all of the problems,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nEven though the crisis center will fill an important gap, Lewis believes grant money still needs to be restored for community mental health centers. She says those funds are needed to help continue keeping people well after the work of the crisis center has ended.\n\n\u201cThe connection\u2019s essential, but how long can that connection hold?\u201d Lewis asks. \u201cAnd how much can the community mental health center bear with no more revenue for the ongoing needs of those people?\u201d\n\nThe crisis invention approach may be spreading, however. Advocates are currently seeking funding for a crisis facility on the Missouri side of the state line.\n\nEds note: This version adds clarity to the statement mental health funding levels in Kansas.", "264": "Mental health funding will be cut by 1.8% from April, to the dismay of six leading mental health organisations and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).\n\nNHS England and Monitor, the economic regulator, will be cutting funding for non-acute care services by 1.8%. Acute, hospital-based services will have a budget reduction of 1.5%.\n\nA letter signed by the heads of the Centre for Mental Health, the Mental Health Foundation, Mental Health Network, Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the issues should be \"resolved quickly\".\n\nWriting for the Guardian, the letter claims: \"Mental health is chronically underfunded.\n\n\"Mental health services are straining at the seams and these new cuts will mean support is slashed in response to instructions from NHS England. This decision will cost much more in the long term as it will drive up admissions to A&E and the number of people reaching crisis and needing expensive hospital care.\"\n\nNorman Lamb, the care services minister, has called the decision to penalise mental health services \"flawed and unacceptable\".\n\nDr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cWe support the government's commitment to bringing about equality between mental and physical health. However, this simply will not happen until more resources are made available for mental health. It is therefore hugely disappointing to hear that NHS England is not planning any uplift in mental health funding.\n\n\u201cMental health services are currently under huge pressure as they face increasing levels of demand, high rates of bed occupancy, and insufficient staff numbers. This development is a further blow as we know that many mental health trusts have had their funding reduced in recent years, which has exacerbated the situation.\u201d", "265": "A \u201clost generation\u201d of young people could occur if key mental health services are not protected from funding cuts, charities have warned.\n\nRethink Mental Illness said early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services - which help people recover from psychosis - are struggling to survive across England.\n\nFurther cuts will result in \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of young people suffering psychosis missing out on key care - affecting recovery and leading to extra costs for the NHS due to hospital stays, it said.\n\nNew data from Rethink shows that 50 per cent of EIP services in England have faced cuts in the past year, some by as much as 20 per cent.\n\nMore than half of EIP services surveyed said the quality of care they can offer has fallen in the last year, while 58 per cent have lost staff.\n\nThe charity warned that, in some places, EIP services are being disbanded completely despite the fact many are already over-stretched and unable to meet local demand.\n\nIt also warned about the impact of NHS England and Monitor setting a higher efficiency requirement - therefore suggesting less income - for mental health services in 2014-15. The issue has been highlighted by HSJ in recent months, including criticism from health minister Norman Lamb.\n\nJane Hughes, director of communications and campaigns at Rethink, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that these crucial services are going through major funding cuts.\n\n\u201cEarly intervention is absolutely critical in helping young people recover from psychosis, which affects around 220,000 people in England. This care saves lives - it reduces the risk of a young person with psychosis taking their own life, from as much as 15 per cent to just 1per cent.\n\n\u201cIt also offers the NHS huge savings, by helping young people avoid reaching crisis-point and being hospitalised. If early intervention care was available to everyone who needs it, the NHS would save \u00a344 million each year care through reduced use of hospital beds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why cutting early intervention care makes no sense whatsoever. The human, social and economic costs of are too great, especially at a time when mental health hospitals are completely over-stretched and unable to cope with demand.\n\n\u201cWe are at risk of losing a generation of young people who, with the right support, could have good quality of life and play a meaningful role in society. We wouldn\u2019t accept this situation for young people with cancer, so why should it be different for young people with psychosis?\u201d\n\nSarah Brennan, chief executive of YoungMinds said: \u201cThe report supports research undertaken by YoungMinds which found that two-thirds of local authorities in England have reduced their child and adolescent mental health services budget since 2010.\n\n\u201cThese services play a vital role for vulnerable children, young people and their families and intervening early minimises escalation of problems and associated costs. It not only makes economic sense to invest in early intervention services, but there is also a clear moral imperative to do so.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health spokeswoman said the government has invested over \u00a350 million into improving access to treatment for young people with mental health problems.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds. We are clear that the NHS must place equal priority on physical and mental health - decisions on how to spend NHS money should reflect this.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with Rethink and are jointly convening a Psychosis Summit next month to understand how better care can be provided to people with psychosis.\u201d", "266": "Cutting money from April contradicts government promise to put mental and physical healthcare on an equal footing, they say\n\nPeople with mental health problems could die because of controversial NHS funding changes which breach ministerial pledges to treat patients with psychological or physical conditions equally, patient charities are warning.\n\nSix leading mental health organisations say NHS England's decision to cut the amount of money the sector will receive in \"tariffs\" or fees for its services from April will badly hit an area of NHS care that is already \"straining at the seams\".\n\nThey are angry that NHS bosses and Monitor, the NHS's economic regulator, are imposing a 1.8% cut in the amount of money for non-acute care services, which include mental health. That is higher than the 1.5% reduction in the budget for acute hospital-based medical services.\n\nIn a letter published in Wednesday's Guardian they warn that the decision \"contravenes the government's promise to put mental and physical healthcare on an equal footing and will put lives at risk\".\n\nThe co-authors of the letter include the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Mental Health Network.\n\nThe differential tariff is being brought in to raise \u00a3150m to help acute hospital trusts pay for the extra staffing needed to comply with the recommendations of the Francis report into the Mid Staffs care scandal. NHS England and Monitor argued that non-acute service providers did not need extra money to tackle understaffing because Francis's recommendations did not cover them. However, David Cameron and several ministers have made clear that providers of all types of NHS care should be improving their staffing levels if necessary.\n\nDoing so will cost non-acute providers about \u00a3150m, the same amount that they are losing in effect to subsidise hospital services, according to an estimate drawn up by the Foundation Trust Network.\n\nNorman Lamb, the care services minister, has called the decision to penalise mental health services \"flawed and unacceptable\".\n\nLord Victor Adebowale, chief executive of the addiction and mental health charity Turning Point, has called the decision \"bordering on laughable\". The NHS England board \u2013 of which he is a member \u2013 never discussed it before it was approved, he said, \"and there are lessons that should be learned\".\n\nThe co-authors of the letter want NHS England to think again and cut both types of services equally. But while NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson last week acknowledged the criticism of the way the decision was reached, he made clear that it would not be reviewed because acute hospitals needed the money to hire more nurses.", "267": "The recent decision by NHS England and the health regulator Monitor to recommend cutting funding for mental health services by 20% more than that for acute hospitals completely contravenes the government's promise to put mental and physical healthcare on an equal footing and will put lives at risk.\n\nFollowing Mid Staffs, all NHS services were obliged to comply with the Francis report to improve care and safety for patients. NHS England funded the additional costs of implementing these recommendations, yet it withheld this from mental health services \u2013 creating a significant budget shortfall. Not only does this send out a disturbing and deeply disappointing message, it is likely to have far-reaching consequences for people with mental illness.\n\nMental health is chronically underfunded. It accounts for 28% of the disease burden, but gets just 13% of the NHS budget. Mental health services are straining at the seams and these new cuts will mean support is slashed in response to instructions from NHS England. This decision will cost much more in the long term as it will drive up admissions to A&E and the number of people reaching crisis and needing expensive hospital care.\n\nMid Staffs was one of the biggest tragedies the NHS has ever faced. People died because those in charge failed to respond to repeated warnings that things were going wrong. Let's not make the same mistake twice. Time is running out; we urge NHS England and Monitor to do the right thing and resolve this issue swiftly.\n\nSean Duggan Chief executive, Centre for Mental Health, Jenny Edwards CEO, Mental Health Foundation, Stephen Dalton Chief executive, Mental Health Network, Paul Farmer CEO, Mind, Mark Winstanley CEO, Rethink Mental Illness, Professor Sue Bailey President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists", "268": "Picture: Burger/Phanie/Rex Features\n\nBudget cuts have left tens of thousands of adults with mental health problems without key social care support that could help prevent their health from deteriorating to crisis point, a leading charity has warned.\n\nAn analysis by Mind found that the number of adults with mental health needs who received social care support has fallen by at least 30,000 since 2005, a drop of 21%. Cuts to local authority social care budgets \u2013 the majority of which have hit since 2009 \u2013 have left a funding shortfall for care of up to \u00a3260 million, the charity said.\n\nMind extracted the data from research published by the London School of Economics in December last year. When demographic changes are accounted for, the fall in the number of mental health service users in receipt of social care support since 2005 could be as high as 68,000 \u2013 a 48% drop. The reduction in the number of people with physical health needs receiving social care support was 33%.\n\nThe report also found that almost a third (30%) of councils had halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.\n\nPaul Farmer, Mind\u2019s chief executive, said the findings suggested the government was failing to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d around support for people with mental health needs.\n\n\u201cIn reality it is cheaper to provide preventative services like social care, which help people affected by mental health problems at an earlier stage, in comparison to crisis services that are currently understaffed and overstretched,\u201d he said.\n\nFarmer also urged the government to introduce a \u2018more reasonable\u2019 national threshold for social care than the current plans to set it at a level equivalent to the \u2018substantial\u2019 band used by the vast majority of local authorities. The powers to set a national threshold for care are included in the government\u2019s Care Bill, which is expected to complete its journey through Parliament shortly.\n\nFrontline social workers have also raised concerns over funding for services. More than half (50.5%) of 111 mental health social workers surveyed by The College of Social Work (TCSW) said investment in statutory social work for mental health was \u2018poor\u2019 in their area. Over a third (35.3%) rated standards of mental health care as \u2018poor\u2019 and almost half (47%) reported problems accessing personal budgets for people with mental health needs.\n\nSteve Chamberlain, chair of TCSW\u2019s network of Approved Mental Health Professionals, said the cuts to social care support highlighted by Mind could be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the next two or three years is likely to see even more cuts to funding for local authorities. Thresholds for social care have already gone up in many areas as there is less money to go around. It feels like we are increasingly unable to intervene earlier and work with people to access social elements that can help to maintain their mental health and avoid crises,\u201d he said.\n\nFaye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers mental health forum, also said that rising thresholds for social care were leading to less preventive work.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to support someone\u2019s recovery it\u2019s about things like supporting them to integrate into their community, helping them to access employment or benefits, supporting them to get their life back. The support cannot be restricted to just the healthcare part. You take those other social support components away and you\u2019ve got a real problem,\u201d she said.\n\nSarah Norman, co-chair of the Association for the Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) mental health network, said the research had to be viewed in the context of significant reductions to local authority budgets in the past three years and a general drive to reduce dependency on services.\n\n\u201cThroughout, social care services have done their utmost to maintain services for people with mental health issues, and to extend as far as possible the principles of personalisation in working with them,\u201d she said.\n\nAdass believes that the government\u2019s proposed threshold for care, under the Care Bill, is likely to widen rather than reduce eligibility for social care, Norman added.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said the government expected NHS and local authorities to ensure \u201cequal priority\u201d is given to mental health and physical health services when making spending decisions.\n\n\u201cWe have given councils significant extra funding for social care and are going further by creating our \u00a33.8bn Better Care Fund to invest in joined up services that keep people living well and independently for as long as possible. Our national eligibility threshold will be set at a level that will allow local authorities to maintain the same level of access to support for those who are eligible when they move to the new care and support system in April 2015,\u201d she added.", "269": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The charities say early intervention programmes save money in the longer term\n\nSix mental health organisations in England are warning that NHS cuts are putting lives at risk.\n\nIt comes as figures reveal that early intervention schemes to help young mental health patients have been reduced over the past 12 months.\n\nMental health trusts are being asked to save almost 20% more from next year's budgets than hospitals.\n\nNHS England says it has put procedures in place to ensure mental and physical health are treated equally in future.\n\nThe Mental Health Foundation, Rethink Mental Illness, Mind, the NHS Confederation Mental Health Network and the Centre for Mental Health and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have released a letter on Wednesday warning that planned cuts for next year will put lives at risk as the system is already underfunded.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Katy Harrison: \"I had to wait 12 months to get on the waiting list for a psychologist\"\n\nOne charity says half of early intervention programmes aimed at young people have been cut in the past year.\n\nEarly intervention schemes are intended to reduce suicide rates, prevent patients from becoming more ill and to keep patients out of hospital and in work, and were praised last week by the chief medical officer for England.\n\n'False economy'\n\nSean Duggan, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, said early intervention programmes were \"very good value for money\" and the prospect of budget cuts was \"very worrying\".\n\n\"Early Intervention in Psychosis services are known to be highly effective in helping young people to negotiate their first episode of psychosis\", he said.\n\n\"They offer hope of a brighter future by helping young people to stay in education, to get and keep work, and to support their physical health.\"\n\nHe described the cuts as a \"false economy\".\n\n\"They save the NHS \u00a39 and the wider economy another \u00a39 for every \u00a31 invested in them.\"\n\nHe added that the cuts meant young people are now facing delays in getting help.\n\nA separate report from the charity Mind shows that mental health patients are losing social care support in greater numbers than elderly or physically-disabled people.\n\nThe charity points to research by the London School of Economics which suggests 30,000 people with mental health problems have lost their social care support since 2005, following a \u00a390m shortfall in funding.\n\nIt also found that one in three local authorities in England halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.\n\nIn a statement, NHS England said it had been \"working solidly in its first year now to ensure that mental health no longer inhabits the silo that existed in the old system but is fully embedded in all the work we're doing to deliver outcomes and high quality care\".", "270": "Maryland lawmakers are moving to make it easier to medicate mental hospital patients against their will, while examining the idea of court-ordered therapy for mentally ill people who aren't hospitalized.\n\nThe legislation is based partly on recommendations from a panel convened by Gov. Martin O'Malley after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. That case prompted a national debate about the adequacy of care for mentally ill Americans.\n\nBut while some mental health advocates have long sought additional tools to better manage treatment \u2014 for the sake of the patient and public safety \u2014 the proposals have created a rift in the health care community. Some argue such measures are inhumane and unconstitutional.\n\n\"This is part of the dilemma in choosing between, on the one hand, necessary treatment, and having high respect for people's individual rights,\" said Del. Dan Morhaim, the General Assembly's only physician and sponsor of the medication legislation. \"We are trying to strike the right balance and really help those who need it.\"\n\nThe state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene supports legislation that would expand the circumstances under which a doctor could medicate mental health patients without their consent. In those cases, as a check and balance, a review must be done by a clinical panel.\n\nHealth officials argue that the longer patients go without treatment, the worse their illness and chances for recovery become.\n\nSome lawmakers want further study of a proposal that would allow patients to be forced to get outpatient treatment. They also want an outside panel to study other alternatives, such targeted outreach efforts called \"assertive community treatment\" that engage those with mental illnesses rather than forcing treatment.\n\nOther measures that would make it easier to have people committed are less assured of passage. One bill would clarify the criteria needed to have somebody hospitalized when they have a psychotic break, but opponents warned the commitment process could be abused. A Senate committee voted against that proposal.\n\nThe state health department supports clarifying the standards for hospitalization of mentally ill patients, but it would rather see changes made through regulation, not legislation.\n\nUnder the law, patients must be deemed a danger before they can be hospitalized, but practitioners and institutions widely interpret the definition of dangerous.\n\nThe health department recently studied deficiencies in the state's behavioral health system that led to periods without care for those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and other conditions. Those breaks can on rare occasions lead to dangerous situations.\n\n\"There are some people that may not be in a position where they can make decisions about their treatment,\" said Dr. Gayle Jordan-Randolph, deputy secretary for behavioral health at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who chaired the panel.\n\nBut balancing the need for treatment against individual rights is difficult, experts said.\n\nForcing people into treatment may not be effective, said Linda Raines, chief executive officer of the Mental Health Association of Maryland. She said it might be more effective to engage patients and help them understand they need help.\n\n\"Why don't we give people the option first to let them self-select what will make them better,\" Raines said.\n\nShe called some of the legislation proposed in the General Assembly a \"substantial and frightening step backward\" that would merely increase the number of people who are institutionalized.\n\nOthers say steps must be taken to ensure the mentally ill get the care they need before a crisis occurs. In fiscal year 2012, an analysis of Medicaid data found that 588 people, or less than 1 percent of the state's mental health population, accounted for one-quarter of all emergency department visits. Those patients visited the emergency department six or more times in a year. Many are believed to have a mental disorder called anosognosia, which causes them not to recognize that they are sick.\n\nSome families of mentally ill patients say they can't afford to wait for more studies.\n\nDr. Steven Sharfstein, CEO of Sheppard Pratt Health System, supports mandatory treatment options because he has seen families desperate to help their loved ones. Doctors sometimes tell them the only way their relatives can get help is if they get arrested, he said.\n\n\"Families will tell you about how frustrated and frightened they are because their family member won't get care and how much havoc it creates,\" Sharfstein said.\n\nSome mental health advocates back mandatory outpatient care as a way to ensure consistent care and fewer hospital visits. Many patients learn to manipulate the system, adhering to treatment while institutionalized but going back to their old ways once released, advocates said.\n\n\"There are people who cycle in and out and don't get stabilized in the community,\" said Kate Farinholt, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Maryland. \"They end up getting released into the community with recommended treatment, with a history of not getting that recommended treatment, and becoming dangerous to themselves or others and getting hospitalized again. Or worse yet, picked up and put in jail or prison.\"\n\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland and Maryland Disability Law Center support a community approach to treatment that provides basic services such as housing to improve the living conditions \u2014 and mental state \u2014 of the mentally ill.\n\n\"Assertive community treatment\" programs have been successful in other states, but have proved expensive. New York has spent $2 billion on its program.\n\n\"As a general principal, we do not believe coercion is a benefit to anyone in the long run,\" said Laura Cain, managing attorney for the Maryland Disability Law Center. \"We believe there are alternatives to engage people voluntarily. In the longer run, when a person becomes motivated on their own, that is where recovery actually begins.\"\n\nTonier Cane said she is an example of how forced treatment doesn't work. The 46-year-old Annapolis motivational speaker was in and out of jail and mental institutions for 19 years beginning in 1989. She blames her bipolar disorder, depression and drug addiction.", "271": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Tuesday it\u2019s making steady progress on health-care sign-ups, but the White House needs something close to a miracle to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of this month.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said more than 940,000 people signed up during February for private coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million.\n\nWith open enrollment ending March 31, that means to meet the goal, another 1.8 million people would have to sign up during the month, an average of about 60,000 a day.

Of those signing up in February, 27 percent were between the ages of 18-34. Their premiums are needed to help defray the cost of caring for older generations. Independent analysts have said the mix should be 40 percent young adults.\n\nBut people 55-64 are the leading age group among those signing up, cumulatively accounting for 30 percent of total enrollment.\n\n\u2014More than four out of five who have enrolled thus far were eligible for tax credits to help offset the cost of premiums, and in some cases also to reduce their deductibles and copayments.\n\n\u2014Sixty-three percent of those signing up picked a mid-range silver plan.\n\n\u2014Fifty-five percent of those signing up are women, and 45 percent are men. \u201cEnrollment among women remains particularly strong,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\nAn AP analysis of state-by-state enrollment numbers showed that 13 states are running ahead of their enrollment targets. Virginia, with a new Democratic governor who supports the health care law, was the latest addition to that list. Six of the top-performing states are led by Republican governors: Florida, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nSome states that have run into trouble have reduced their enrollment goals.

Through Tuesday, the shares had gained 54 percent since Ackman announced his short position.\n\nHerbalife is confident it is in compliance with all laws and will cooperate with the investigation, the Cayman Islands company said.\n\nThe probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. The company has repeatedly denied Ackman's allegations and won allies including billionaire Carl Icahn.\n\n\"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,\" the company said.\n\nJustin Cole, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to comment.\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nBonuses up 15% on Wall Street\n\nWall Street's bonus pool rose 15 percent to $26.7 billion in 2013, fueled by compensation deferred from prior years, according to estimates by New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.\n\nEmployees took home an average bonus of $164,530 last year, the most since the 2008 financial crisis and the third highest on record, DiNapoli said in a statement Wednesday. The bonuses rose even as profits from broker-dealer operations of New York Stock Exchange member firms fell 30 percent to $16.7 billion in 2013.\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs Group, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each rose more than 95 percent over the past two years, making equity awards worth more than when they were granted in previous years. During the same period, the bonus pool has grown by 44 percent, driven by deferred compensation, DiNapoli said.\n\n\"The industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates,\" said DiNapoli. \"Wall Street continues to demonstrate resilience as it evolves in a changing regulatory environment.\"\n\nAVIATION\n\nAirline earnings drop further\n\nAirline earnings for 2014 will be $1 billion or 5 percent lower than previously predicted as political tensions drive up oil prices and growth in emerging markets slows, the International Air Transport Association said.\n\nCarriers will earn a combined net income of $18.7 billion, compared with the $19.7 billion forecast on Dec. 12, the industry group said Wednesday.

CBS and Warner Bros. Television have reached a deal for a three-year renewal of broadcast TV\u2019s top entertainment series, The Big Bang Theory, that would keep the hit comedy on the air through the 2016-2017 season, the series\u2019 10th. No one is commenting, but I hear the license fee is in the $4 million-$5 million range per episode (closer to $4 million), a high number for a comedy series. This marks Big Bang\u2018s second consecutive three-season pickup, a commitment reserved only for the biggest shows on television. While it is the biggest deal by far, Big Bang is not the only WBTV comedy in renewal talks with CBS. I hear the network and the studio also are in discussions on the other three Chuck Lorre series, with a 13-episode final season of Two And A Half Men eyed along with renewals for next season of Mike & Molly and freshman Mom.\n\nRelated: Warner Bros TV Readies Offers To \u2018Big Bang\u2019 Cast, In Talks With CBS For New 3-Year Deal\n\nWith the Big Bang license deal secured, WBTV and CBS will turn their attention to the cast. There had been some overtures but no real negotiations so far with original cast members Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar, whose contracts are up at the end of this season. (Big Bang\u2019s other regulars, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, closed new deals last fall.) Put on hold while license fee negotiations were going on, talks with Galecki, Parsons and Cuoco are expected to kick into gear soon. Currently at about $350,000 per episode, the three leads are projected to get to the Friends cast mark of $1 million an episode.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is head and shoulders above any non-sports series on broadcast TV and still posts year-to-year gains seven seasons into its run. Season to date, the comedy is averaging 19.79 million viewers in most current ratings ( up 4% from last season), and 6.1/19 in adults 18-49. The relatively quick and painless renewal after a couple of months of talks extends CBS and WBTV\u2019s good track record of largely smooth negotiations on high-profile, complex renewals like previous Two And A Half Men and Big Bang deals. \u201cComedy is a big part of our schedule, and The Big Bang Theory is the biggest comedy force on television,\u201d said CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler. \u201cThis multi-year deal further strengthens our network\u2019s position for future seasons and marks another chapter in the great partnership CBS enjoys with Warner Bros Television for delivering audiences the best in comedy. We\u2019re proud to work with and showcase the incredible talents of Chuck Lorre, Steve Molaro and this amazing cast every week.\u201d Lorre and Bill Prady created the series, which they executive produce with showrunner Molaro. Big Bang, which also is the highest-rated series in syndication, propelling TBS to No. 1 in adults 18-49, has garnered three Emmy Award nominations for best series and has won three Emmys for star Parsons.\n\nGiven Two And A Half Men\u2018s longevity and its importance, a final-season order reflects the desire by both sides to give the comedy a proper send-off. The series, now in in its 11th season, still delivers healthy ratings and has perked up in its new Thursday 9 PM slot. Last week, it drew a 2.5 in 18-49 and 10 million viewers, the show\u2019s largest audience and highest 18-49 rating since the season premiere. Mike & Molly and Mom are part of CBS\u2019 Monday lineup, which has been on the soft side this year. Still, they have stayed mostly at and above a 2 demo rating in Live+Same Day, most recently logging a 2.2 (Mike & Molly) and 2.0 (Mom). Plus, both have a bona fide star as a lead, Melissa McCarthy and Anna Faris, respectively.\n\nThe blockbuster status of Big Bang is expected to have a halo effect on the other Lorre series\u2019 renewals between CBS and WBTV, where the prolific writer-producer is based. It does make sense for a studio to leverage a hot property in negotiations with a network. Last May, Sony TV was able to secure a four-series pickup deal with NBC on the strength of new drama The Blacklist, which helped get series orders for two other Sony pilots, Welcome To The Family and Night Shift, as well as a renewal for Community.", "304": "Fans of The Big Bang Theory rejoice! The hit U.S. sitcom has been renewed for a further three seasons by CBS, meaning that the show will air at least until 2017, at which point it will have reached its tenth season.\n\nThe series is currently in its seventh season, and has been pulling in record viewers for CBS, while stars Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar are currently in negotiations about extending their contracts with what will surely be wallet-bursting deals for Warner Bros.

This is a big surprise present for fans. There may be geeky-nerdy parties going on now in celebration of this news.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory has started its run since 2007, and it has captured the hearts of all types of social stereotypes. For this reason, the show is a constant hit for CBS, and it's eve getting the network's highest ratings to date in its current seventh season.

Others turned into contenders, such as Malaya Watson of Southfield, who transformed herself from a 16-year-old tuba player in braces to bonafide star.\n\nShe received a standing ovation, closing the show with \"I Am Changing\" from \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nHow did our other Metro Detroiters do? Sam Woolf of West Bloomfield performed \"Come Together\" from the movie soundtrack for \"Across the Universe.\" And Jena Irene Asciutto of Farmington Hills did \"Decode\" from \"Twilight.\"\n\nRecapping last night's show is Shelby Miller, a Season 13 contestant from Portland, Michigan.\n\nShelby made it to Hollywood week and even survived the Group Round. She just missed the Top 15 girls this season.\n\nFollow Shelby's career on her Facebook page.\n\nOne contestant will be eliminated tonight, March 13 (9 p.m., Fox).\n\nSHELBY MILLER\n\nTonight's episode of American Idol began with a great quote from Harry Connick Jr., \"You have to be in it to win it!\"\n\nAlthough this phrase may have been used before, the contestants needed to chose a song that showed that they are anything but what we have seen before.\n\nSam Woolf started out the night with \"Come Together\" from the movie \"Across the Universe.\" I really enjoyed this performance from Sam. He showed true confidence and personality. Sam proved that he was not ready to leave and the audience agreed. Unlike the judges, I enjoyed the humility that Sam has as he performs and do not think he needs to feel like he is a \"star\" to be one.\n\nJessica Meuse was next to perform with her rendition of \"Sound of Silence.\" This was a perfect song choice for her tone, but the timing seemed a bit off towards the end of her performance. I believe this timing was the fault of the band tonight, so I commend Jessica for pushing through. I loved seeing Jessica in her element tonight with regards to the song, but I agree with Jennifer Lopez that Jessica needs to show that she is ready to win American Idol. I also agreed with Keith Urban's comment that the contestants need to adapt to their environments and explore the opportunities that different crowds will provide.\n\nNext to perform was CJ Harris who performed the song \"Can't You See.\" CJ started his performance with great passion, tone, and control. This was an excellent song choice for CJ. He brought out his personality without having to move all over the stage. I absolutely loved CJ's performance tonight and have no doubt that he will make it into the Top 10 this season.\n\nDexter Roberts next performed with the song \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" I think this was a great choice for Dexter. Dexter stayed true to his roots and showed what kind of artist he will be with this song. I do think Dexter could have added a bit more personality to the song and moved around the stage more, but this was a good performance.\n\nThe show continued with a unique song choice from Ben Briley. Ben performed \"Bennie and the Jets\" on tonight's episode. I loved the piano playing, but was expecting more with the vocals. Ben could have really worked the crowd with this song, but instead I feel that he played it a little safe. I think Ben took a risk with the high notes in the end of the song, but I do not think it paid off.\n\nUp next was Majesty Rose who sang \"Let It Go\" from the movie \"Frozen.\" I thought parts of her performance were strong, while other parts lacked. Some of Majesty's high notes needed more control and I hope that she can improve on this aspect if she is put through to the next round.\n\nCaleb Johnson was up next with the song \"Skyfall.\" This was an interesting choice for Caleb. I was so happy to see him slow it down tonight and really show off his vocal abilities. Even without the dramatic stage productions that he has had in the past, Caleb proved that he will be going somewhere big. I thought this was a great moment for Caleb Johnson.\n\nMK Nobilette performed \"To Make You Feel My Love\" from Harry Connick Jr.'s own movie \"Hope Floats.\" I have performed this song and can say that it is indeed difficult to pull off the emotion while keeping control. I believe MK did a great job tonight and truly connected with her audience with this performance. As the judges said, MK can pull off so much powerful meaning with such simplicity.\n\nAlex Preston performed the song \"Falling Slowly.\" I absolutely loved this performance. I could feel emotion with every line that he sang. The realness that he brought to the lyrics easily brought the audience to tears. Although it is still early in the season... I must say my pick for Season 13's American Idol is Alex Preston.\n\nJena Irene next performed with her rendition of the song \"Decode\" as heard on \"Twilight.\" I did enjoy the power behind Jena's voice, but I did not think it was great. I did not agree with Jennifer Lopez that this was the best performance of the night. Coming back from the bottom three, I thought Jena needed to blow America away and I just don't know if she did tonight.\n\nLast to perform tonight was Malaya Watson singing \"I Am Changing\" from the movie \"Dreamgirls.\" This performance was perfection. Malaya showed immense passion and control throughout this song. Her stage presence was wonderful as always. This was easily the best performance of the night and was a great way to end the episode. I truly enjoyed this performance. I believe all of the contestants brought their strengths to the stage tonight and I am interested to see who will be moving on to the Top 10.\n\nI would have to say that my bottom three contestants based on tonight are Jena Irene, Ben Briley and Dexter Roberts.\n\nAlthough these artists performed well, the competition is tough, and I do not think they were at the same level as some of the others. But, as always, it is up to America.\n\nJohn Gonzalez is a statewide entertainment writer for MLive.com.

That\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not going to win a competition.\n\nKeith urges him to \u201cmake it individual.\u201d JLo says he\u2019s \u201cstarting to believe\u201d that he can win. Harry says he needs \u201cto be bigger than that song.\u201d\n\n)\n\nBen Briley: \u201cBennie and the Jets.\u201d WHAT. Ben is changing things up in a big way this week. Suit, slick hair and piano. I LIKE IT. Ben has been overlooked and underplayed in favor of C.J. and Dexter, and I\u2019m not sure why. He\u2019s an engaging performer and unique vocalist. He ably handles this Elton John classic, at least to these ears. It\u2019s a fun, frisky performance. I really am enjoying this.\n\nJLo doesn\u2019t think it \u201csuited who you are.\u201d UGH. Harry says \u201cit didn\u2019t feel like it had a purpose.\u201d WHATEVER. Keith \u201cis a little confused by it, too.\u201d HATERS.\n\n)\n\nMajesty Rose: \u201cLet It Go.\u201d I have lots of love for Majesty. I have lots of love for this song. I have lots of love for Idina Menzel. But it\u2019s just too big for Majesty. The lows are too low, and the highs are way too high. That money note is way off the mark. This song is about fragility, but it\u2019s also about power, and I don\u2019t think she capture all those moments. THAT SAID \u2014 I still think Majesty is an intriguing, interesting, engaging performer. She\u2019s one of the few people here who seems like a star.\n\nHarry calls it \u201ca strong performance.\u201d Keith says she has to \u201cease into it a little bit more.\u201d JLo loves her diversity.\n\n)\n\nCaleb Johnson: \u201cSkyfall.\u201d OK, I didn\u2019t get this at first. So I rewatched. Now I get it. Caleb absolutely knows his voice, probably more than anyone else this season. It\u2019s a theatrical, dramatic vocal but never veers into parody. And Caleb still manages to infuse it with his glam-rock spirit. Masterful in a lot of ways.\n\nKeith says it was \u201can amazing choice.\u201d JLo calls it \u201ca perfect song choice.\u201d Harry says he\u2019s \u201cgoing to be very hard to beat.\u201d\n\n)\n\nMK Nobillette: \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love.\u201d There are still some nerves and looks of awkwardness. But I think that\u2019s just going to be who MK is. Vocally, she\u2019s getting back on her game. It\u2019s a great choice for her tone and presence, and she locks into the quiet emotion. It\u2019s really just about confidence at this point.\n\nJLo compares her, vocally, to kd lang. Harry \u201cthought it was nice.\u201d Keith thinks she\u2019s \u201creally, really good.\u201d\n\nAlex Preston: \u201cFalling Slowly.\u201d Alex is at his best when he\u2019s putting his quirky acoustic spin on songs that are not normally quirky and acoustic. When he does something like this, which is already that, it\u2019s just OK. By no means terrible. But it should feel transcendent, and it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen these types of performances on here before.\n\nHarry calls it \u201csimply stated and elegantly done.\u201d Keith sees \u201ca raw fragility.\u201d JLo calls it \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\n)\n\nJena Irene: \u201cDecode.\u201d I love the tone of Jena\u2019s voice. She pulls me in from the first line. There\u2019s a Tori Amos vibe happening in there. which is a very good thing. Jena\u2019s voice pierces through the crashing arrangement.\n\nKeith calls it \u201cexhilarating.\u201d JLo thinks she has \u201cone of the best voices here\u201d and dubs it \u201cbest performance of the night.\u201d Harry says it was \u201cjust as good\u201d as the original.\n\nMalaya Watson: \u201cI Am Changing.\u201d Malaya goes big, and it mostly pays off. This isn\u2019t perfect. She overshoots some moments and wavers off key a few times. But it\u2019s really good, and the effort is what really drives it home. Malaya is fearless, and that\u2019s the mark of a star.\n\nJLo calls it \u201ckiller.\u201d Harry says it\u2019s a \u201cnice job.\u201d Keith says she\u2019s \u201cmagnificent.\u201d\n\nA good night overall, right? Here\u2019s where I stack them.\n\nJena Irene\n\nMalaya Watson\n\nCaleb Johnson\n\nC.J. Harris\n\nMK Nobillette\n\nAlex Preston\n\nBen Briley\n\nMajesty Rose\n\nDexter Roberts\n\nJessica Meuse\n\nSam Woolf\n\nI\u2019d expect Jessica, because the other girls are more memorable; and Ben, because the other guys are more memorable, to be in the bottom two. One of them will go home. The third person is a tough call, though I have a feeling it could be MK again. (Ugh.)\n\nSam is safe because the new voting system allows fans to cast ballots before someone performs, which is ridiculous. Things would likely be different if that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d airs at 7 p.m. Wednesdays and 8 p.m. Thursdays on Fox. And catch me recapping the night during the 5 p.m. news Thursdays and Fridays on Fox 26 Houston!\n\nNote: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post\u2019s poll.", "308": "Game on.\n\nAfter a few lackluster live shows, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d top 11 finalists broke out the big guns Wednesday night, delivering a cluster of sensational, stand-out performances.\n\nFor the first time, season 13 feels like a spirited competition, with each performer working hard now to choose songs that play to their strengths, all the while building a star-caliber stage presence to keep America voting.\n\nSpecifically, two songs from musicals, alongside a \u201cTwilight\u201d track really stole the show in \u201cSongs from the Cinema\u201d week, but top-to-bottom, most everyone had a strong outing.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss:\n\nTHE BREAKDOWN\n\nSam Woolf singing \u201cCome Together\u201d by The Beatles\n\nThe girls are going to scream for Sam no matter what he does, but from a more unbiased opinion, this was nothing special. It was good for Sam to try a more upbeat song without his guitar, but he\u2019s so awkward up there, it was at times difficult to focus on his singing. Keith said Sam needed to loosen up more, and J-Lo called him \u201cbaby rock star.\u201d\n\nJessica Meuse singing \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel\n\n\n\nThis was definitely Jessica\u2019s best live performance so far. She seemed more comfortable with the song, and more engaging, despite falling behind the music at one point. It still felt a little like a \u201cbar show,\u201d but with Jessica, it seems this is about as good as it\u2019s going to get. \u201cDo you think you can win?\u201d J-Lo asked. Jessica said \u201cyes.\u201d The rest of us aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nCJ Harris singing \u201cCan\u2019t You See\u201d by Marshall Tucker Band\n\nGreat choice by CJ to sing the southern rock classic. The grit in his voice complimented the tune wonderfully and for the first time in a while, his pitch matched his passionate, heart-on-the-sleeve style. Everything fell into place this time around and CJ should be proud of himself. Keith gave him a standing ovation. \u201cYou just sung your way back to the forefront of this competition,\u201d Harry said.\n\nDexter Roberts singing \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nNot much to say about this one. It was a well-sung, predictable song choice from the \u2018Bama boy. It won\u2019t help him much in the competition, but shouldn\u2019t hurt him either. Keith told him to individualize his song choices. \u201cYou have to be bigger than that song,\u201d Harry\n\nadded.\n\nBen Briley singing \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d by Elton John\n\nAn odd choice from Ben, who cleaned up, took off his hat and played some keys for the first half of the song, which fell somewhere between a solid cover and a mockery. There were some pitch problems, but the biggest issue came when he tried falsetto for the last verse and his voice never quite got there. \u201cIt felt like a lackadaisical walk through the song,\u201d Harry said.\n\nMajesty Rose singing \u201cLet It Go\u201d by Idina Menzel\n\nNot to be mean, but this was terrible. Majesty never came close to the power needed for this song, and although she deserves a little credit for taking on the big song, she was completely over-matched. This wouldn\u2019t have gotten her through auditions. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t send her home. She\u2019s better than this. \u201cYou need to ease in a little more,\u201d Keith said.\n\nCaleb Johnson singing \u201cSkyfall\u201d by Adele\n\nGood for Caleb getting away from rock for the night, and for the most part, this epic cover did the trick. There were a few hiccups, but his voice fit the song pretty well and he used every molecule of his powerful chops to hit those high notes. \u201cThat was fantastic,\u201d Harry said.\n\nMK Nobillette singing \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201d by Bob Dylan\n\nStill a little stiff, but a very nice vocal from MK. The sweet song fell right in her wheelhouse and she showed more range than she has in past weeks, but she continues to have confidence issues on stage. She always seems like she can\u2019t wait for the performance to be finished. The judges seemed to like it though, calling her \u201csubtle\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nAlex Preston singing \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d by Glen Hansard\n\nFantastic showing from Alex, who completely transformed the rather simple tune into this superb arrangement that allowed him to shine on notes both big and small. He really nailed the money note at the end, and the whole performance was can\u2019t-look-away good. Harry called it \u201csimply stated and elegantly done.\u201d\n\nJena Irene singing \u201cDecode\u201d by Paramore\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but still a very confident, powerful performance from Jena. The song choice, and the key were both smart choices, giving way to Jena\u2019s big, belting notes, which seem more effortless for her than any of the other contestants. Some of her runs were a little messy, but overall, a strong showing for sure. \u201cThere\u2019s a ferocity about the way you perform,\u201d Keith said.\n\nMalaya Watson singing \u201cI Am Changing\u201d by Jennifer Hudson\n\n\n\nMalaya\u2019s rousing performance of the \u201cDreamgirls\u201d tune closed the show on an emphatic note. At only 16, this girl can really show off, and although she doesn\u2019t have the same range Jennifer Hudson does, Malaya still gave arguably her best outing so far. Keith and J-Lo stood up for it. \u201cThe song was perfect to play to your strengths,\u201d Keith said.\n\nPOWER RANKING\n\n1. Alex Preston\n\n2. Jena Irene\n\n3. Malaya Watson\n\n4. CJ Harris\n\n5.

Great performances all around. Majesty was the only contestant to really drop the ball. She and MK should be worried tonight.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019d be very surprised to see Jena in the bottom three again. She\u2019s been the most consistent contestant so far, and this was a huge week for her.\n\n\u2022 I was happy to see CJ have such a great week and show that he does belong in the top 10. For a while he was looking pretty shaky.\n\n\u2022 The \u201cIdols making fun of each other\u201d gags before each performance were a little lame, but still silly and most of all, very accurate. The Malaya impressions were the best.\n\nBut this is just my rambling. What did you think? Comment below.", "309": "Viewers might have been tempted to break out the popcorn tonight as the top 11 singers performed on \"American Idol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nC.J. Harris of Jasper is among three Alabamians who've survived previous cuts on the show. On this occasion, Harris went straight to his roots, selecting a tune that combines Southern rock, blues and country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the latest on Harris, 23, as seen on the 7 p.m. broadcast.\n\n\n\nThis week's theme: Music from films. Contestants picked songs that reflect \"the soundtrack of their lives.\"\n\nWhat he sang: \"Can't You See\" by \"Can't You See\" by Marshall Tucker Band . It was featured in 2001's \"Blow.\"\n\nWhat Harris said: He's extremely familiar with the song, after performing it for five or six years. Harris cradled a new guitar during his chat with \"Idol\" host Ryan Seacrest, and proclaimed himself blessed to be there.\n\n\n\nWhat the judges said: Universal praise from Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban and Jennifer Lopez. \"I think you just picked and sang your way back to the forefront of this competition,\" Connick said. \"That was very, very strong. Nice job.\" Urban called the performance \"killer, man\" and said Harris nailed every note. From Lopez: \"You're the front-runner, baby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical reaction: Rough-edged and raspy, imbued with real-deal emotion. Harris played to his strengths this week, choosing a song that suits him perfectly. Resurrecting the Marshall Tucker Band, circa 1973? Could have been a disaster, but Harris' version of the vintage tune came out soulful and cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next: Viewers will vote for their favorites in several ways, including a new method linked to Google searches. One singer will be eliminated on the March 13 episode, which airs at 8 p.m. CST. Connick and Mali Music will perform on the results show.\n\nYep, it was movie night. Contestants on the Fox reality series were asked to present material that's been featured on the silver screen, choosing songs that suit their personalities and backgrounds. Fingers were crossed for something more compelling than \"A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme),\" and this year's group of hopefuls delivered, covering tunes that ranged from \"Decode\" to \"Bennie and the Jets.\"", "310": "The top 11 contestants looked to the silver screen tonight on \"American Idol,\" covering songs from movie soundtracks. In the past, this theme hasn't been very successful on the Fox reality series -- many singers went no further than shallow Disney hits -- but the current crop of hopefuls came up with some interesting choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nJess Meuse of Slapout is one of three Alabamians left in the competition during Season 13. The rock singer-songwriter took the film challenge seriously, transforming a wistful ballad that harks back to the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the latest on the Meuse , 23, as seen on the 7 p.m. broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week's theme: Music from the movies. Contestants chose songs that reflect \"the soundtrack of their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Meuse said: \"It's a really deep and introspective song.\" Meuse says she's been playing \"The Sound of Silence\" regularly in nightclubs; it's been a staple of her setlists for some time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the judges said: Reactions were mixed among Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick Jr. Lopez said Meuse never found her groove. (\"We should have been blown away, but I wasn't.\") Connick praised Meuse for staying focused when the band's arrangement -- oddly timed and distracting -- could have thrown her off. Urban encouraged her to use the microphone with more subtlety, playing off \"the quietness of the room.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical reaction: Meuse's rendition was compelling, with a twangy vibrato and stylized phrasing. She plugged into the emotions of the ballad, giving the lyrics a muscular heft. This was quite different from the ethereal treatment made famous by Simon & Garfunkel, but the twist worked for her. The \"Idol\" backing band was no help, though. Why not try an a cappella version?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next: Viewers will vote for their favorites in several ways, including a new method linked to Google searches. One singer will be eliminated on the March 13 episode, which airs at 8 p.m. CST. Connick and Mali Music will perform on the results show.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's at stake: Singers who make the top 10 will travel on the \"American Idol\" tour this summer. It's a step toward a major-league career, a way to make some money and an opportunity to continue momentum built on the show.", "311": "The American Idol 2014 Top 11 took on songs from the cinema Wednesday night and like the cinema, there were some blockbuster performances and some flops.\n\nAs always, I\u2019ve reviewed each performance and assigned the letter grade I think each one deserved.\n\nSam Woolf, \u201cCome Together.\u201d It was nice to see Sam change things up. He ditched the guitar and picked a song a little more upbeat, but overall, it was just OK. There were no big moments in the song and he didn\u2019t really seem to be totally comfortable. It\u2019s definitely not his best effort. Performance Grade: B\n\nJessica Meuse, \u201cThe Sound of Silence.\u201d Great, great song choice. And her vocals were great. The overall performance wasn\u2019t existing or anything, but it was nice and moody. But it was sort of just sitting there. I think like Jennifer said, something was off, but it was still a pretty solid effort. Performance Grade: B+\n\nC.J. Harris, \u201cCan\u2019t You See.\u201d This is another good song choice. Not only is it a good song, but it really worked for him. It was his best performance in my opinion. His vocals were spot on and he was connected. He also made the song his own. I really liked the arrangement and the spins he put on it. Performance Grade: A\n\nDexter Roberts, \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d This song choice makes a lot of sense for him. I\u2019m pleased with the song choices tonight. He handled the song pretty well, but I found it boring. I mean there were no technical issues or anything, but it was just OK. Performance Grade: B+\n\nBen Briley, \u201cBenny & The Jets.\u201d Eh. That piano playing was a bit harsh and the tempo was weird. And the vocals were OK at best. It\u2019s a good song, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right singer to do a stripped down version. Thankfully the band broke in later. It all got better then, but it was still not that great. Performance Grade: C+\n\nMajesty Rose, \u201cLet It Go.\u201d I didn\u2019t expect to hear such a new song. And I wish she\u2019d picked something else. It just wasn\u2019t good. There were a few good moments, but there were a lot of bad moments. Performance Grade: C+\n\nCaleb Johnson, \u201cSkyfall.\u201d Well this isn\u2019t the person I expected to cover Adele, but OK. Let\u2019s see how it goes. He picked the right kind of song. He did need to pull back this week. So he picked a more mellow song, but still delivered the powerful big vocals. It was pretty solid. Performance Grade: A-\n\nMK Nobilette, \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love.\u201d Every single performance of hers is the same. It\u2019s always mellow and in the same key and she\u2019s usually on a stool. This performance was actually more connected than her previous ones, but I think it might be too late for her. It wasn\u2019t bad, though. Performance Grade: B\n\nAlex Preston, \u201cFalling Slowly.\u201d Well this is the third time this song has been done on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Which is way too much. I think it\u2019s a great song, though. But Alex\u2019s version was weird and almost unrecognizable. I hated it. Performance Grade: C\n\nJena Irene, \u201cDecode.\u201d What is this song? Why? Ugh. It was nice to see her back at the piano. I don\u2019t know the song, but it was perfect for her. She sounded amazing. Her vocals were perfect and she didn\u2019t miss a beat with the song\u2019s intensity and emotion. Performance Grade: A+\n\nMalaya Watson, \u201cI Am Changing.\u201d This was the perfect song for her. This is the kind of song that just really fits for her. She had a few iffy moments, but the vocals were big and it all really worked for her. That ending note alone is enough for an A. Performace Grade: A-\n\nWhat did you think of the American Idol 2014 Top 11 performances?", "312": "Our beloved Deirdre linked to TV Line's \"Reality Check\" with Melinda Doolittle (season 6) and the incomparable Michael Slezak where they discuss what we are seeing: great judging, bad mentoring.\n\nMaybe \"Idol\" should have made Harry Connick Jr. the full-time mentor and just find someone else as the judge. (No Randy Jackson, please!).\n\nHowever charming he is on the dais, these kids really need help on stage. They seem to be having trouble with song choice, arrangements, keys, you name it. Yet I still feel like there's enough talent there to salvage the season. They noted how Connick said he wishes in some ways he COULD mentor the contestants behind the scenes, rather than just have a few seconds to critique them in front of the world. He clearly cares enough that he would and could spend plenty of time with them maximizing their performances and as Slezak said, he was in effect throwing shade at Jackson for his mentoring (or lack thereof.). That seems to be a reasonable conjecture given how little mentoring we've actually seen from said Jackson.\n\nAnyway, the top 11 did generally do better tonight picking songs from films, giving us some hope this group isn't hopeless. And the judges (especially Keith this week for Jessica) provided some good advice.\n\nThe three best performances: Caleb Johnson pulled back on his cliche rock thing and did an intense Adele song intensely. Jena Irene took a tough song and brought it home. C.J. Harris has been underwhelming for weeks but finally found his comfort zone with Marshall Tucker. Was someone (gasp!) mentoring him properly?\n\nThere was only a single disastrous performance: Ben Briley's perplexing rendition of a lounge singer. It may even place him in the bottom three. But will he go home for it? Tough call. He should go home, I fathom.\n\nNone of the ladies did anything so awful to deserve missing the tour though several were just so so. Majesty Rose has been a favorite for weeks so a subpar performance shouldn't drop her to the bottom. MK Nobillette is just waiting for her elimination at some point. Often times, when someone like that does a passable job, that virtually guarantees their trip home because their few fans will get complacent. Jessica Meuse disappointed yet again. When she should have hit a home run on a fat fastball, she merely rapped a single.\n\nI don't know if Malaya Watson being placed in the pimp spot will prevent her from being in the bottom three. Sam Woolf still hasn't really found his footing on the live stage but he is getting better and progress is better than regression. Dexter Roberts was merely adequate with a crowd pleaser which Harry Connick Jr. noted is probably good enough for him. Alex Preston did his quirky singer-songwriter thing again and did it well.\n\nSo my bottom three are Malaya, MK and Ben. I predict MK will go home.\n\nMy rank of the 11: 1. C.J. 2. Caleb 3. Jena 4. Alex 5. Sam 6. MK 7. Majesty 8. Malaya 9. Dexter 10. Jessica 11. Ben\n\nRandom trivia: season 8 winner Kris Allen sang three of tonight's songs on \"Idol\": \"Come Together,\" \"Make You Feel My Love\" and \"Falling Slowly.\"\n\nHere are quick takes on the performances, in order:\n\nSam Woolf (\"Come Together\" Beatles from \"Across the Universe\") - He has been very stiff so he goes for a more upbeat song and he sounds great. He is still stiff, with some improvement. Both Keith and J. Lo note the improvement. She wishes he had put more bite into it. HCJ said it was an average performance that was \"pretty good.\" Grade: B/B-plus\n\nJessica Meuse (\"Sounds of Silence\" Simon & Garfunkel from \"The Graduate\") - She has sung this song a million times so she should be able to rock it. I think she is trying to be solemn but looks oddly disconnected. It's a passable vocal but not a bracing performance like it could be. Something is missing, unfortunately. J. Lo said it should be the perfect song for her moodwise but felt something wasn't right. HCJ blamed the band as \"off.\" Keith says in small joints you have to sing close to the mic but here she has to use the dynamics of the room better. \"You're in a different environment,\" he says. Grade: B/B-minus\n\nC.J. Harris (\"Can't You See\" Marshall Tucker Band from \"Blow\") - He finally found a song that really highlights his voice. It's bluesy and soulful and he finally looks comfortable on the big stage. He got Keith Urban to give him a proper standing ovation. HCJ said he placed himself back to the \"forefront\" of this competition. Keith said \"it was killer... I know exactly who you are.\" Grade: A\n\nDexter Roberts (\"Sweet Home Alabama\" Lynyrd Skynyrd) - He sings it with a pleasant demeanor and even threw in \"roll Tide roll.\" Again, he is an awesome bar band singer. As for \"Idol\"? Unmemorable. Yet again, Keith said he needs to make it sound more distinctive. HCJ said his objective is to win the competition and he said it was good but \"you have to be bigger than that song.\" He was not bigger than that song. Grade: B\n\nBen Briley (\"Bennie and the Jets\" Elton John from \"27 Dresses\") - I never particularly liked this song. He is singing this like a lounge singer. What is up with that? Bizarro! J. Lo contorted herself not to be too insulting but you could tell she wasn't buying it. HCJ said you have to pound the piano but it felt like a lackadaisical walk through the song and had no purpose. \"Pointless,\" he said. Grade: C\n\nMajesty Rose (\"Let It Go\" Idina Mendez \"Frozen\") - I know this is a huge song from \"Frozen\" but having not seen \"Frozen\" and not having young kids, I'm not terribly familiar. It seems to have standard Disney tropes. I hated her dress but her performance seemed very respectful. She seems to be swallowed up by the song for some reason. HCJ said she is spreading herself stylistically thin. But tonight, she did a good job. Keith said it's a tough song that was written for her but felt she attacked it too much. Grade: B/B-plus\n\nCaleb Johnson (\"Skyfall\" Adele from \"Skyfall\") - He picked a song I thought Majesty would have sung. But it was smart. It took him away from rock but he brought strength and confidence and resonance to the song that was not an imitation of Adele. Keith said it wasn't predictable but dependable. \"An amazing choice and great restrained performance. Great power.\" HCJ said he is proof he thinks this is the best top 13 ever. (I don't but alas...) Grade: A/A-minus\n\nMK Nobillette (\"Make You Feel My Love\" Bob Dylan/Billy Joel/Garth Brooks) - That was the best we've heard in awhile. I tried not to watch her because honestly, seeing her blank face kind of ruins the effect. J. Lo compared her to k.d. Lang. HCJ says she has star quality when she focuses it and owns it. He wishes she had cut the runs by 50-75 percent. Keith says she looks like a star. Grade: B-plus\n\nAlex Preston (\"Falling Slowly\" Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova from \"Once\") - He is like the next lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls. Very emotive but doesn't over do it. HCJ says he likes that Preston did it simply and elegantly. Keith: It held his attention. \"Raw fragility\" in the most complimentary way. \"Authenticity\" and \"artistry\" bonus points. J. Lo said it was perfect. Grade: B-plus\n\nJena Irene Asciutto (\"Decode\" Paramore from \"Twilight\") - I am not familiar with this song, proving how out of that teen demo I'm not in anymore since I've never seen \"Twilight.\" But honestly, I liked it. It felt like she was in her element. She brought a lot of \"ferocity\" to it, as Keith said. HCJ said it was different and just as good as the original. Grade: B-plus/A-minus\n\nMalaya Watson in the pimp spot! (\"I Am Changing\" Beyonce from \"Dreamgirls\") - She has the tone and the volume but lacks the depth in her voice.. I think she simply isn't ready for primetime. I would love to hear her in five years. This song proves that she is on the right path but she's not there yet. Keith said she knows songs that play to her strengths. He feels she can rein it in at times and gets caught up. Grade: B/B-plus", "313": "We are desperate to hear some big WOW moments on the American Idol 2014 Top 11 performances show tonight. We don\u2019t have any American Idol spoilers on what the finalists will be singing this evening. However, we\u2019re hoping the song theme for this week will give the contestants plenty of opportunities to impress us and American Idol judges Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer Lopez, and Keith Urban.\n\nOur original American Idol 2014 spoilers had the song theme for this week listed as \u201cSongs From the Cinema.\u201d However, we\u2019ve also heard tonight\u2019s theme referenced as \u201cSoundtrack of Our Lives.\u201d Either way, there should be tons of songs for the American Idol Top 11 to perform that will truly show off their diverse vocal styles and abilities. Well, we hope so anyway.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t agree with TV Guide when they say this is the \u201cmost boring\u201d group of American Idol finalists ever (we give that to season 9), the contestants really, really need to step it up this week. Last week\u2019s American Idol performances show was a bomb, and only a couple of the singers managed to pull off a decent showing \u2014 and even those were not standing ovation material.\n\nWe kick off tonight with a video montage of the American Idol Top 11 and it\u2019s all about giving it your all tonight because it\u2019s getting serious. Then we have our typical intro of the finalists and the American Idol judges, and a bit about this evening\u2019s show, which is all about \u201cSongs From the Cinema.\u201d The song choice has to be from a movie soundtrack.\n\nJennifer Lopez is actually wearing full clothes tonight (mostly) but her dress is such a bright shade of hot pink it is hard not to be blinded.\n\nWhichever contestants survive this week will get to go on the American Idol Live Tour this summer, which means cash, promo deals, and lots more face time in front of the fans. Everyone is wanting that for sure!\n\nA bit of chatter from the American Idol 2014 judges about what the contestants needed to do to prepare this week. And then it\u2019s time to get going with the performances!\n\nAmerican Idol Top 11 Performances:\n\nSam Woolf: \u201cCome Together\u201d by The Beatles from Sgt Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band\n\nThis is one of those songs you feel like the singer needs to have really lived to sing it with the pain and passion it needs. Sam has decent vocals on the song, but we just aren\u2019t feeling it in our guts. And with this song, you have to feel it deep in your gut like it is grabbing you and yanking you around. We also aren\u2019t feeling the t-shirt and shiny blazer with this song. So not the right visual.\n\nThe American Idol judges are so-so about it. They don\u2019t think they pushed it enough and harry called it an \u201caverage performance\u201d and a \u201cpretty good job. We agree.\n\nVote Sam Woolf: Text 12 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-12 (1-855-443-6512)\n\nJessica Meuse: \u201cSound Of Silence\u201d by Simon and Garfunkle from The Graduate\n\nWe love this song, but Jessica is sounding a little sharp and flat on it. Although it is hard to tell because this song is a little odd that way anyway. Still, it\u2019s not really what we wanted tonight. We wanted to hear something rocking and powerful. Instead, we get a song that is too nasal, too quiet, and doesn\u2019t really show off her vocals to best effect. (Ryan notes after the performance that the band was actually off with Jess for a moment or two.)\n\nThe American Idol judges seem to agree that it wasn\u2019t the most stellar performance. J-Lo says it seems \u201clike the perfect song\u201d but she felt like Jessica just never got her \u201cgroove on.\u201d Harry likes it more, although we feel like he gave some backhanded compliments. Keith tells Jess she needs to be more dynamic and think about how she is using the mic in a very different environment than she is used to.\n\nVote Jessica Meuse: Text 10 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-10 (1-855-443-6510)\n\nCJ Harris: \u201cCan\u2019t You See\u201d by Marshall Tucker Band from Blow\n\nThis is exactly the right kind of song for CJ. We wouldn\u2019t say it is one of the very best performances on the show ever, but it\u2019s a really strong song for CJ. He shines and we remember why he is in the Top 11 in the first place.\n\nAll of the American Idol judges are loving it. Harry says CJ is back in the competition, and J-Lo says this song makes him a front-runner. Harry says it doesn\u2019t even matter that he was a bit sharp, because he could feel the performance and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nVote CJ Harris: Text 5 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-05 (1-855-443-6505)\n\nDexter Roberts: \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd from Sweet Home Alabama\n\nIn what is probably the most obvious song choice ever, Dexter Roberts takes on the unofficial anthem of his home state of Alabama. Not a bad idea considering it\u2019s totally in his wheelhouse. Plus, it pretty much guarantees he\u2019ll get a huge block of Southern votes. he could sail all the way to the Top 5 at least off that voting block.\n\nKeith loves Dexter\u2019s new haircut, which makes him look a bit more grown up and polished. However, he thinks Dexter had to do more than just sing it well. He needs to invest it with her personality. J-Lo says kind of the same thing and says that Dexter really has to believe he can win and he\u2019s starting to show that more. Harry says he thinks Dexter was really, really smart by doing a song that everyone knows and giving a solid performance. However, he needs to give it more creativity.\n\nVote Dexter Roberts: Text 1 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-01 (1-855-443-6501)\n\nBen Briley: \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d by Elton John from 27 Dresses\n\nHe\u2019s never seen the movie, but he loves Elton John, so Ben has picked a song that also happens to go with his name. He\u2019s cleaned up tonight and has his hair slicked back and is wearing some kind of fuzzy dark green suit. It\u2019s an interesting look\u2026 We aren\u2019t feeling really killer about this performance. It\u2019s nice, but not wow and he is not a wiz on the piano. It\u2019s just a little weak.\n\nThe American Idol judges don\u2019t think it was powerful enough either. Harry Connick Jr. in particular really gives him some harsh criticism, and even accuses Ben of not being real. Jennifer just doesn\u2019t know who Ben is an artist because he keeps wandering all over the map with his songs. Keith isn\u2019t thinking it so hot either and he feels like Ben has lost his authenticity and has lost his realness as an artist.\n\nVote Ben Briley: Text 4 to 83676 or call Call 1-855-4-IDOL-04 (1-855-443-6504)\n\nBefore the next performance, we take a break with host Ryan Seacrest to see how the voting is going so far, split by male and female votes.\n\nMajesty Rose York: \u201cLet It Go\u201d by Idina Menzel from Frozen\n\nMajesty says this song should have been written for her and she seems very, very confident about it. We think it is very daring to take on a song that is SO huge out there right now and just won an Oscar. The sad thing is that we feel she doesn\u2019t do a very good job with it at all. Although we\u2019re sure her fans will bash us for that. But she sounds like she\u2019s out of breath, she\u2019s pitchy, and she loses the high notes in places. Honestly, it sounds like one of her weakest performances.\n\nThe American Idol judges, however, are far more loving. Harry says he feels like Majesty is singing so many different kinds of things, he isn\u2019t sure exactly what kind of singer she is. However, he did think it was a strong performance. If she is going to do so many different styles though, she has to be perfect. Keith Urban says his wife (Nicole Kidman) and kids are watching from home and probably loving it. He says that it is a really big song though and she needed to ease in into it a little more and not attack it so much. J-Lo says she could be singing songs for Disney, or be an actress, or on Broadway, or whatever. She thinks it is a positive that Majesty has such variety, not a negative.\n\nVote Majesty Rose York: Text 7 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-07 (1-855-443-6507)\n\nCaleb Johnson: \u201cSkyfall\u201d by Adele from Skyfall\n\nOur rocker is dressed up tonight, going for a little bit of long-haired James Bond with his performance. We thought this song choice was really kind of odd\u2026 but we are actually loving it! It\u2019s a totally different side to Caleb hearing him do this kind of clear, sweet ballad voice. We don\u2019t know if the American Idol judges will like it, but we really dig him doing something different than his usual big rock.\n\nKeith Urban gives Caleb a brief standing ovation. He says Caleb was totally unpredictable tonight but still dependable, something Harry talked about last week. He loved it. Jennifer Lopez trips over her words but says she has been waiting for this kind of performance. Harry says he stands by saying last week this is his favorite group of contestants ever. He thinks the competition really started tonight and Caleb was \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nVote Caleb Johnson: Text 13 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-13 (1-855-443-6513)\n\nMK Nobilette: \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201d by Garth Brooks & Trisha Yearwood from Hope Floats\n\nMK is doing a song from one of Harry Connick Jr.\u2019s movies tonight. She\u2019s not wearing a hat tonight, at last, but instead she has died her hair a crazy yellow and spiked it up. She apparently just can\u2019t have normal hair\u2026 But, of course, it\u2019s not about the hats or the hair. It\u2019s all about the voice. And, tonight, the Glee-style Sue Sylvester track suit. Okay, sorry, the voice. The song is good in places and weak in places\u2026 it\u2019s more the right kind of song but she\u2019s still lacking confidence and wanders off the pitch a bit. We wanted a strong, powerful ballad. This is more of a kind of a pretty but weaker ballad that doesn\u2019t really have the wow and ooomph she needed being in the bottom as she is.\n\nJennifer Lopez says she felt MK really trying to connect and talks about how she can\u2019t help thinking about k.d. lang when she hears her. Harry agrees with J-Lo that MK has a subtle voice and he thinks she does have star quality. He cautions her that she does need to be careful with runs if she does them, they have to be perfect. Keith says MK is still working on her performance but she sounded great tonight. He says there was a moment where she lost herself and the audience connected, and that\u2019s what she needs.\n\nVote MK Nobilette: Text 6 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-06 (1-855-443-6506)\n\nAlex Preston: \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d by The Swell from Once\n\nWe were very wary of Alex doing this song because it has been so done so many times. We especially remember Alex and Sierra doing this song on The X Factor and it was amazing. We don\u2019t now if Alex Preston really gets the same wow from the song that they did, but we do think it was very lovely. Not one of our favorite performances ever on Idol, but it is certainly one of the best of the evening.\n\nThe judges oddly don\u2019t really have a lot to say. They are just kind of say a few complimentary words and then move on very quickly. We feel like maybe they have been told they need to keep it short and go faster?\n\nVote Alex Preston: Text 9 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-09 (1-855-443-6509)\n\nJena Irene Ascuitto: \u201cDecode\u201d by Paramore from Twilight\n\nWe reserve all judgement about doing a song from Twilight, although it certainly appeals to a HUGE fan base out there, which is never a bad thing. We do feel this is probably the best female vocal performance of the night so far. Jena also doesn\u2019t have any problem banging on the keys for her performance, that\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s strong, on pitch, powerful, and the crowd is on it\u2019s feet.\n\nThe judges are on their feet too! Jena pulled it out tonight and it\u2019s obvious since the crowd will not shut up to let the judges talk. Keith says he loves when Jena plays the piano and gets fierce and \u2018hurtles along the cliff\u2019 with her performance. He loved it. J-Lo says she doesn\u2019t know why Jena was in the bottom three last week because she has one of the best voices and she\u2019s the real thing. America needs to get on board because that was the best performance of the night. Harry says he is a huge fan of Paramore and her performance was just as good as theirs but different and her own thing.\n\nVote Jena Irene Ascuitto: Text 8 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-08 (1-855-443-6508)\n\nMalaya Watson: \u201cI Am Changing\u201d by Jennifer Hudson from Dreamgirls\n\nMalay has the final \u2018pimp\u2019 spot tonight and the big power ballad as well. This is basically a recipe to pull in votes for her by the carload. We think the performance is strong and powerful, but\u2026 it kind of pales in comparison to Jennifer Hudson. If you put the two performances side by side, we just think Jennifer would blow Malaya away like a plastic bag in a windstorm. Certainly one of the top performances of the night and Malaya does a great job, but we don\u2019t think this will be one of those songs people are playing over and over years later.\n\nThe judges love it, of course, and they are full of praise for Malaya. Keith Urban is kind of the only one who gives a little criticism that she could have maybe pulled it back a little to give the performance more finesse.\n\nVote Malaya Watson: Text 2 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-02 (1-855-443-6502)\n\nNote on American Idol Voting Numbers:\n\n* Please note that the American Idol phone numbers this year for the finalists are the same every week, unlike previous seasons when they depended on performance order!\n\nOr vote online via SuperVote at AmericanIdol.com or through the Idol app.", "314": "Last week, American Idol had one of its flattest weeks in a long time, so the show had a lot to prove for its trip to the cinema this week. Luckily for the contestants of the Top 11, they nailed it. Even the bad performances weren't so bad, and there were some truly breakthrough performances. In a season where a lot of the singers surfacely only seem OK, this week, they proved they're \"in it to win it\" (as Harry Connick Jr. would say).\n\nSo, let's just get to the meat of it all, and look at who did well, not so well and well enough.\n\nThe Good:\n\nCJ Harris: You don't always need a big, swelling ballad to have one of the best performances on American Idol, and CJ Harris proved that very well with his take on The Marshall Tucker Band's \"Can't You See.\" Full of the perfect amount of rasp and controlled, strained vocals, his spin on this classic rock track is the first totally noteworthy performances on this season of Idol. Unlike a lot of the contestants, CJ was clearly at home on stage and he both looked and sounded like a very seasoned singer.\n\nAlex Preston: Alex Preston has such a beautiful vulnerability in his performances, so choosing the highlight of the indie flick Once, \"Falling Slowly,\" was a fantastic choice. With a slightly different arrangement, Alex was able to make this Oscar-winning song his own and evoke pure, strong emotions from the audience. Like CJ Harris, Alex showed there is pure power in the quiet moments and has established himself as a true frontrunner.\n\nCaleb Johnson: Caleb Johnson had grown to be quite predictable taken on frickin' Rush last week, so when tackled Adele's \"Skyfall\" this week, it was a welcome break from all that classic rock. Caleb took this James Bond song and made it feel like an epic '80s ballad, but that's in a good way. He showed off that he just has a killer range, and that can get lost in all the kitschy rock stuff, but here it worked really very well.\n\nMK Nobilette: By now, it's pretty much established that if MK Nobilette wants to get good feedback, she has to do something small and simple and quiet, which is why the oft-covered \"To Make You Feel My Love\" was a really great song choice. She finally seemed to have connected emotionally with a piece of music, falling perfectly into this pretty, simple little love song. If this doesn't pull her out of the bottom three, I don't know what possibly could.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBen Briley: Like \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" it's always super enjoyable to watch somebody sing Elton John's \"Bennie And The Jets.\" The judges noted that this was a weird song choice for Ben Briley, who's usually so country, but I think he was just trying to show his versatility. This is a campy song, and Ben took it there, lightly plucking at the piano keys and effortlessly moving about the stage. His vocals were a little off on the high notes and he did kind of miss the mark, but it isn't the worst thing we've seen on Idol this year, and it certainly wasn't boring.\n\nMajesty Rose: It must be so hard to even think about singing the epic Frozen song \"Let It Go,\" but Majesty Rose is one of, like, three Idol contestants this year who could have even considered it, and she did. First off, the arrangement she and the band worked out was so chopped up and amended; it was really distracting for basically everyone in the world who's singing that song right now. She did, however, do a decent job of showcasing how \"Let It Go\" builds, but the quiet bits at the beginning were much prettier and well done than the massively loud and proud ending. It's just hard to even try to be Idina Menzel, and I'm not so sure anybody should try.\n\nSam Woolf: Sam Woolf started off tonight's episode with his take on the Beatles' \"Come Together,\" in this case from Across The Universe. My favorite thing about this song is how raw and gritty it can be, and even though he's only 17 years old, Sam had the potential to take this song to a more rocking, sexy place and he, well, didn't. It was a just very neutered take. As the judges (particularly Jennifer Lopez) noted, he's getting more comfortable on stage, but he's not 100 percent loose yet. As for the vocals, they were totally solid -- Sam isn't just in the top 11 because of that smile, and he showed that again. He had some really nice runs near the end of the song that made up for how vanilla he was during the rest of the performance.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n\nJessica Meuse: There's something totally off about the American Idol band this season, namely in that they're just not very good and have a hard time melding with the singers. This was the case last week with Emily Piriz (who was eventually sent packing), and it definitely affected Jessica Meuse tonight. During her otherwise very pretty, simplistic take on Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound Of Silence,\" the band was so off for several bars that it was really unfortunate and distracting. Jessica handled it like a pro and kept on trucking, eventually allowing her unique tone to shine through. That whole band thing was just such a shame.\n\nDexter Roberts: It's always fun to watch somebody perform the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" and seeing Dexter Roberts do it is no different. Week after week, Dexter gives a solid, straightforward country performance and as he showed his little more rocking side, it worked. I still worry (like the judges) that he could get lost in the shuffle in the world of country, but it was enjoyable enough.\n\nJena Irene: Far and away, choosing to sing Paramore's \"Decode\" is the best decision Jena Irene has made so far this season on Idol... it's like this song was built for her. After two weeks straight in the bottom three, Jena had something to prove this week, and powered away at the piano. Her smoky, unique vocals fitted this chorus so well (sorry) that she should be able to move herself up in the Idol rankings. But if the fanbase isn't there... it isn't there. Jena is a wildcard pick, after all.\n\nMalaya Watson: Of course Malaya Watson was influenced by Dreamgirls, so for this week, the 16-year-old tackled the classic musical's \"I Am Changing.\" There's something very young Michael Jackson-y to Malaya's voice, and that never comes out more than when she's belting away on some big ol' ballad. That was the case here, and while it worked enough to make the judges proud, she's just still so young and it's quite distracting. Idol was clearly looking for a big moment with this song, and the producers kind of got it.\n\nWho Should Go Home:: Ben Briley\n\nWho Will Go Home: Either MK or Jena. Their performances were more solid than Ben's, but I just don't think they have strong fanbases.", "315": "Tonight the \"American Idol\" 2014 Top 11 attempt \"Songs From the Cinema.\"\n\nWill there a \"Titanic\" moment?\n\nWe know for sure we'll be looking closely at our Detroit contenders. Will they do a song from a Motor City-based soundtrack?\n\nMalaya Watson of Southfield could do a song from \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nSam Woolf of West Bloomfield could break out his shell a bit with \"Lose Yourself\" from Eminem's \"8 Mile Soundtrack.\"\n\nOr maybe Jena Irene Asciutto of Farmington Hills gets lost in the '80s with a song from the \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" movie.\n\nHere is what Shelby Miller, a Season 13 contestant from Portland, Michigan is looking for tonight (8 p.m., March 12, Fox). Shelby has been helping me out this season as guest blogger.\n\nShelby made it to Hollywood week and even survived the Group Round.

She just missed the Top 15 girls this season.\n\nFollow Shelby's career on her Facebook page.\n\nAs for the results this week, one contestant will be eliminated on March 13.\n\nSHELBY MILLER\n\nAmerican Idol's Top 11 will be performing in this week's episode for their place in the Top 10. At this point in the competition, every decision counts. I believe the most important aspect of the contestants' performances this week will be song choice.\n\nAlthough this may seem to be a simple part of the equation, song choice is where the performance stems from. A smart song choice will allow the contestant to show range, personality, control, and style.\n\nJena Irene is one competitor that I am interested to see choose a song this week. I did not believe Jena chose the right song last week, and this will be her chance to redeem herself. I think Jena has great potential, but she needs to think about her decisions this week. This is a make or break it situation for Jena in my opinion.\n\nAlex Preston on the other hand needs to think less about his performance and just let his worries go. It is easy for an audience to pick up on insecurities when an individual is placed in the middle of the iconic Idol stage, so Alex needs to take control of his performance. Alex has proven to show his artistry in past song choices and this week his focus should be on stage presence and a song that will allow him to move around the stage to really get the audience engaged.\n\nJessica Meuse must have control during her performance this week. I can tell that she has a unique tone, but I now need to see her power. Jessica must chose a song that will show her strengths. She also needs to keep control throughout this performance.\n\nAs for Dexter Roberts, the passion that he brought to last week's performance will be key. After the knock-out performance that he had in his Home Week performance, Dexter must keep the momentum going and show growth to ensure his place in the Top 10.\n\nI believe it is time for Caleb Johnson to step out of his comfort zone and chose a slower song. Caleb has shown us his powerhouse side, but it is time for the audience to see technique. Although it is possible to show technique in an upbeat song, I believe a slower song will show the diversity in Caleb's voice.\n\nMK Nobilette really needs to work on her stage presence and connection with the audience this week. Her voice demonstrates passion and true artistry, but it is hard for me to connect to the performance when her face reveals her nerves. If MK Nobilette can let loose and enjoy her time on stage this week, I believe she will be in the Top 10.\n\nCJ Harris must show control this week. I think the emotions got to him last week as he performed \"Change\" by John Mayer. CJ is one of those contestants that simply has raw talent, but I believe he needs to work with the vocal coaches this week and really learn how to make vocal choices with purpose.\n\nAs for Sam Woolf, I think it would be smart for him to work off of the energy that the audience gives him every week. An up-tempo song may be the best for this, simply because it will allow Sam to move to different parts of the audience and get the whole crowd involved. I believe Sam's vocals have been spot-on in the past weeks and so he just needs to continue to pick the right songs that will display the best aspects of his voice.\n\nBen Briley must choose a song that will help him to stand out this week. Although Ben performs well every week, I feel that he could be overlooked if he does not step up his game this week. Ben has great potential and continues to show growth so I am excited to see what he will do with this next performance.\n\nMalaya Watson performed a beautiful song last week and showed America that she is able to control her vocals like a pro. I hope to see the same control this week, but also want Malaya to have fun with her performance. I think the key to her success this week will be finding the middle ground between control and passion.\n\nLastly, Majesty Rose must make smart risks this week. I commend Majesty for taking the chance with her big note at the end of last week's performance, but I think it hurt the song more than anything. I know that she is capable of hitting those notes, but she must remain focused throughout the song this week. Majesty Rose has always been a favorite of mine, and I am hoping she can pull back to her roots this week.\n\nJohn Gonzalez is a statewide entertainment writer for MLive.com.

In the first issue of that journal, out this month, MIT researchers report the first self-contained autonomous soft robot capable of rapid body motion: a \u201cfish\u201d that can execute an escape maneuver, convulsing its body to change direction in just a fraction of a second, or almost as quickly as a real fish can.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about soft robots for a variety of reasons,\u201d says Daniela Rus, a professor of computer science and engineering, director of MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and one of the researchers who designed and built the fish. \u201cAs robots penetrate the physical world and start interacting with people more and more, it\u2019s much easier to make robots safe if their bodies are so wonderfully soft that there\u2019s no danger if they whack you.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother reason to study soft robots, Rus says, is that \u201cwith soft machines, the whole robotic planning problem changes.\u201d In most robotic motion-planning systems, avoiding collisions with the environment is the highest priority. That frequently leads to inefficient motion, because the robot has to settle for collision-free trajectories that it can find quickly.\n\n\n\nWith soft robots, collision poses little danger to either the robot or the environment. \u201cIn some cases, it is actually advantageous for these robots to bump into the environment, because they can use these points of contact as means of getting to the destination faster,\u201d Rus says.\n\n\n\nBut the new robotic fish was designed to explore yet a third advantage of soft robots: \u201cThe fact that the body deforms continuously gives these machines an infinite range of configurations, and this is not achievable with machines that are hinged,\u201d Rus says. The continuous curvature of the fish\u2019s body when it flexes is what allows it to change direction so quickly. \u201cA rigid-body robot could not do continuous bending,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nEscape velocity\n\n\n\nThe robotic fish was built by Andrew Marchese, a graduate student in MIT\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and lead author on the new paper, where he\u2019s joined by Rus and postdoc Cagdas D. Onal. Each side of the fish\u2019s tail is bored through with a long, tightly undulating channel. Carbon dioxide released from a canister in the fish\u2019s abdomen causes the channel to inflate, bending the tail in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nEach half of the fish tail has just two control parameters: the diameter of the nozzle that releases gas into the channel and the amount of time it\u2019s left open. In experiments, Marchese found that the angle at which the fish changes direction \u2014 which can be as extreme as 100 degrees \u2014 is almost entirely determined by the duration of inflation, while its speed is almost entirely determined by the nozzle diameter. That \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the two parameters, he says, is something that biologists had observed in real fish.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be honest, that\u2019s not something I designed for,\u201d Marchese says. \u201cI designed for it to look like a fish, but we got the same inherent parameter decoupling that real fish have.\u201d\n\nThat points to yet another possible application of soft robotics, Rus says, in biomechanics. \u201cIf you build an artificial creature with a particular bio-inspired behavior, perhaps the solution for the engineered behavior could serve as a hypothesis for understanding whether nature might do it in the same way,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nMarchese built the fish in Rus\u2019 lab, where other researchers are working on printable robotics. He used the lab\u2019s 3-D printer to build the mold in which he cast the fish\u2019s tail and head from silicone rubber and the polymer ring that protects the electronics in the fish\u2019s guts.\n\n\n\nThe long haul\n\n\n\nThe fish can perform 20 or 30 escape maneuvers, depending on their velocity and angle, before it exhausts its carbon dioxide canister. But the comparatively simple maneuver of swimming back and forth across a tank drains the canister quickly. \u201cThe fish was designed to explore performance capabilities, not long-term operation,\u201d Marchese says. \u201cNext steps for future research are taking that system and building something that\u2019s compromised on performance a little bit but increases longevity.\u201d\n\n\n\nA new version of the fish that should be able to swim continuously for around 30 minutes will use pumped water instead of carbon dioxide to inflate the channels, but otherwise, it will use the same body design, Marchese says. Rus envisions that such a robot could infiltrate schools of real fish to gather detailed information about their behavior in the natural habitat.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of our algorithms and control theory are pretty much designed with the idea that we\u2019ve got rigid systems with defined joints,\u201d says Barry Trimmer, a biology professor at Tufts University who specializes in biomimetic soft robots. \u201cThat works really, really well as long as the world is pretty predictable. If you\u2019re in a world that is not \u2014 which, to be honest, is everywhere outside a factory situation \u2014 then you start to lose some of your advantage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe premise of soft robotics, Trimmer says, is that \u201cif we learn how to incorporate all these other sorts of materials whose response you can\u2019t predict exactly, if we can learn to engineer that to deal with the uncertainty and still be able to control the machines, then we\u2019re going to have much better machines.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe MIT researchers\u2019 robot fish \u201cis a great demonstration of that principle,\u201d Trimmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s an early stage of saying, \u2018We know the actuator isn\u2019t giving us all the control we\u2019d like, but can we actually still exploit it to get the performance we want?\u2019 And they\u2019re able to show that yes, they can.\u201d", "326": "This \u201csoft\u201d robotic fish, created by Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT) graduate Andrew Marchese, has the ability to turn instantly and can actually swim almost identically to a real fish.\n\nThe robot\u2019s power source, computer and motion sensor are located in its head and the back of its body is made of mostly silicon. Both its head and body casing were also created with a 3D printer.\n\nThe fish\u2019s construction mimics that of a real fish, with its brain located in the creature\u2019s harder front and the technology responsible for its movement is located in the soft more malleable area of the robotic fish\u2019s behind.\n\nIts soft body is why the fish can perform what Marchese calls an \u201cescape manoeuvre,\u201d a common way many real fish escape predators. It involves the fish turning its body in one millisecond to escape predators. Surprisingly, this robotic fish can make the exact same movement.\n\nResearchers are already trying to create a new version of this robotic fish that uses carbon dioxide instead of water running through the channels in the fish\u2019s tail. It will apparently be able to swim underwater for approximately half an hour.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for the inevitable consumer grade version of this awesome robotic creation that will probably come out in five years or so.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @Patrick_ORourke.", "327": "redOrbit Staff & Wire Reports \u2013 Your Universe Online\n\nThe research popularity of soft robots, which are robots with soft exteriors powered by fluid flowing through flexible channels, has grown to such an extent that a new journal has been created about the topic \u2013 Soft Robotics (SoRo), a peer-reviewed journal from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.\n\nIn the journal\u2019s flagship issue this month, researchers from MIT and Worcester Polytechnic Institute describe their work in building the first self-contained autonomous soft robot capable of rapid body motion \u2013 a \u201cfish\u201d with a flexible spine that allows it to execute an escape maneuver in just a fraction of a second, nearly as fast as a real fish could perform such a move.\n\nThe researchers describe the design, modeling, fabrication, and control mechanisms of the robotic fish, along with the novel fluidic actuation system, embedded muscle-like actuators, and an onboard control system that give the fish autonomy and the ability to perform continuous forward swimming motion and rapid accelerations.\n\n\u201cThis innovative work highlights two important aspects of our emerging field; first it is inspired and informed by animal studies (biomimetics), and second it exploits novel soft actuators to achieve life-like robot movements and controls,\u201d said Barry Trimmer, Editor-in-Chief of Soft Robotics and director of Neuromechanics and Biomimetic Devices Laboratory at Tufts University.\n\nDaniela Rus, one of the researchers who designed and built the robotic fish, said the field of soft robots offers additional benefits in the area of safety.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about soft robots for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Rus, professor of computer science and engineering, and director of MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\n\u201cAs robots penetrate the physical world and start interacting with people more and more, it\u2019s much easier to make robots safe if their bodies are so wonderfully soft that there\u2019s no danger if they whack you,\u201d she said in an interview with Larry Hardesty of MIT News.\n\nRus noted that another reason to study soft robots is because \u201cwith soft machines, the whole robotic planning problem changes.\u201d\n\nIn most robotic motion-planning systems, avoiding collisions with the environment is top priority, which often leads to inefficient motion because the robot has to settle for collision-free trajectories that it can find quickly.

Onal - has developed an autonomous soft robot that looks and behaves like a fish and has the capability of rapid body motion. The real fishes can manuever under water by convulsing their bodies in fraction of a second to change direction. The new soft robot from MIT replicates their nature of action and not just has a soft exterior, but it also derives its power from a fluid flowing inside it.The new robotic fish from MIT was designed by keeping in mind infinite range of configurations that comes from the softness and the ability to deform the body continuously.The continuous curvature of the fish\u2019s body when it flexes is what allows it to change direction so quickly.Each side of the fish\u2019s tail is bored through with a long, tightly undulating channel. The channel gets inflated by the carbon dioxide released from a canister in the fish\u2019s abdomen. This in turn bends the tail in the opposite direction. Each half of the fish tail has just two control parameters: the diameter of the nozzle that releases gas into the channel and the amount of time it\u2019s left open.

In the case of some MIT researchers, their soft robotics work have resulted in a form of fish made, in part, with moving fluid. Even better, the robotic fish are able to swim, which is demonstrated in a video we have after the jump.\n\nThe work is a study in soft robotics, and in particular on the use of a body that can deform \u2014 in this case, of a fish\u2019s body that is able to curve as the robot flexes, providing it with advantages that a robot with a hinged body would not have. In this case, a channel is constructed in the fish that inflates with carbon dioxide, allowing the tail to move.\n\nBecause of the construction, the fish is able to perform escape maneuvers until it runs out of carbon dioxide, which in the current iteration is 20 or 30 maneuvers.

But did they ever think about what autonomous creatures could be swarming the waters one day?\n\nPerhaps they should start having that conversation soon.\n\nEarlier this week, MIT unveiled a video and photos of a free-moving robotic fish that can cut through the waters without the guidance of a human being. The life-like machine is so realistic\u2014in both shape and feel\u2014that it mimics the movements of a real underwater creature to a T.

Because it\u2019s made of a \u201csoft silicon\u201d at the base with high-tech gadgets stuffed into the front part of the robotic fish, it allows the device to become capable of those \u201cvery rapid\u201d movements with ease, pushing the envelope, Rus said, of what the future of robots could be like. \u201cThe robots are self-contained, and autonomous. In other words, we can package the power source, the computation, and the actuation and sensing needed for these robots to deliver their motions,\u201d she said.\n\nAndrew Marchese, one of the graduate students working on the complex robotic fish, said the way the machine works is by storing fluid in the more rigid area at the front of the soft robot, in the form of a gas, and releasing that gas through a series of pipes and valves into the body where the tail is. \u201cBasically, by inflating and un-inflating different parts of the body, we can get it to undulate,\u201d said Marchese.\n\nIn order to give the fish directions while it\u2019s submerged underwater, Marchese can send a signal wirelessly from his computer to the \u201cbrains,\u201d telling the hardware what to do next, and prompting it to take those actions accordingly. \u201cThe maneuver is so fast, and it has such high body curvature, that it shows soft robots might be more capable than hard robots in some tasks,\u201d said Marchese.\n\nThe inventors didn\u2019t say how long it would be until lasers are strapped to the head of the fish.\n\n)", "337": "We have talked about robotic fish in the past, so this particular area of development is far from new and unchartered. However, what we have seen so far in the past pales in comparison to this latest invention from MIT researchers, as this new robotic fish actually moves like the real deal, where it is more than capable of altering its direction almost as rapidly as a real fish.\n\nApart from that, it will also look a whole lot more realistic than other versions that have hit the news before, since it will be a soft robot. When we say \u2018soft robot\u2019, we do not mean that it will only have soft exteriors, but it will also run on fluid that flows through flexible channels underneath the \u201cskin\u201d.\n\nTouted to be the first self-contained autonomous soft robot that is capable of rapid body motion, this \u201cfish\u201d is more than capable of executing an escape maneuver, where it will convulse its body in order to change direction in but a blink of an eye. Soft robots, too, would help reduce the risk or danger of collision to either the robot or the environment.\n\nThe robotic fish was developed by Andrew Marchese, who is a graduate student in MIT\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. On each side of the fish\u2019s tail lies a long, tightly undulating channel. Carbon dioxide will be released from a canister in the fish\u2019s abdomen, which results in the channel to inflate, helping bend the tail in the opposite direction instead.

The development of the fish is noteworthy because it\u2019s one of the first instances where a soft robot can perform both advanced, \u201chigh-performance\u201d actions and be completely self-contained (i.e. not tethered to an external brain housing).\n\nPhoto credit: M.

A new version is in the works that would be able to swim without stopping for 30 minutes, channeling pumped water to power its motions instead of using carbon dioxide, however, so if they keep at it, perhaps we\u2019ll have a humane alternative to SeaWorld within the next decade.", "339": "Andrew Marchese, doctoral candidate in EECS at MIT (right), and Dr. Daniela Rus, professor in EECS and Director of CSAIL, hold a soft robotic fish developed by the Distributed Robotics Laboratory.

In the first issue of that journal, out this month, MIT researchers report the first self-contained autonomous soft robot capable of rapid body motion: a \"fish\" that can execute an escape maneuver, convulsing its body to change direction in just a fraction of a second, or almost as quickly as a real fish can.\n\n\"We're excited about soft robots for a variety of reasons,\" says Daniela Rus, a professor of computer science and engineering, director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and one of the researchers who designed and built the fish. \"As robots penetrate the physical world and start interacting with people more and more, it's much easier to make robots safe if their bodies are so wonderfully soft that there's no danger if they whack you.\"\n\nAnother reason to study soft robots, Rus says, is that \"with soft machines, the whole robotic planning problem changes.\" In most robotic motion-planning systems, avoiding collisions with the environment is the highest priority. That frequently leads to inefficient motion, because the robot has to settle for collision-free trajectories that it can find quickly.\n\nWith soft robots, collision poses little danger to either the robot or the environment. \"In some cases, it is actually advantageous for these robots to bump into the environment, because they can use these points of contact as means of getting to the destination faster,\" Rus says.\n\nBut the new robotic fish was designed to explore yet a third advantage of soft robots: \"The fact that the body deforms continuously gives these machines an infinite range of configurations, and this is not achievable with machines that are hinged,\" Rus says. The continuous curvature of the fish's body when it flexes is what allows it to change direction so quickly. \"A rigid-body robot could not do continuous bending,\" she says.\n\nEscape velocity\n\nThe robotic fish was built by Andrew Marchese, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and lead author on the new paper, where he's joined by Rus and postdoc Cagdas D. Onal. Each side of the fish's tail is bored through with a long, tightly undulating channel. Carbon dioxide released from a canister in the fish's abdomen causes the channel to inflate, bending the tail in the opposite direction.\n\nEach half of the fish tail has just two control parameters: the diameter of the nozzle that releases gas into the channel and the amount of time it's left open. In experiments, Marchese found that the angle at which the fish changes direction\u2014which can be as extreme as 100 degrees\u2014is almost entirely determined by the duration of inflation, while its speed is almost entirely determined by the nozzle diameter. That \"decoupling\" of the two parameters, he says, is something that biologists had observed in real fish.\n\n\"To be honest, that's not something I designed for,\" Marchese says. \"I designed for it to look like a fish, but we got the same inherent parameter decoupling that real fish have.\"\n\nThat points to yet another possible application of soft robotics, Rus says, in biomechanics. \"If you build an artificial creature with a particular bio-inspired behavior, perhaps the solution for the engineered behavior could serve as a hypothesis for understanding whether nature might do it in the same way,\" she says.\n\nMarchese built the fish in Rus' lab, where other researchers are working on printable robotics. He used the lab's 3-D printer to build the mold in which he cast the fish's tail and head from silicone rubber and the polymer ring that protects the electronics in the fish's guts.\n\nThe long haul\n\nThe fish can perform 20 or 30 escape maneuvers, depending on their velocity and angle, before it exhausts its carbon dioxide canister. But the comparatively simple maneuver of swimming back and forth across a tank drains the canister quickly. \"The fish was designed to explore performance capabilities, not long-term operation,\" Marchese says. \"Next steps for future research are taking that system and building something that's compromised on performance a little bit but increases longevity.\"\n\nA new version of the fish that should be able to swim continuously for around 30 minutes will use pumped water instead of carbon dioxide to inflate the channels, but otherwise, it will use the same body design, Marchese says. Rus envisions that such a robot could infiltrate schools of real fish to gather detailed information about their behavior in the natural habitat.\n\n\"All of our algorithms and control theory are pretty much designed with the idea that we've got rigid systems with defined joints,\" says Barry Trimmer, a biology professor at Tufts University who specializes in biomimetic soft robots. \"That works really, really well as long as the world is pretty predictable. If you're in a world that is not\u2014which, to be honest, is everywhere outside a factory situation\u2014then you start to lose some of your advantage.\"\n\nThe premise of soft robotics, Trimmer says, is that \"if we learn how to incorporate all these other sorts of materials whose response you can't predict exactly, if we can learn to engineer that to deal with the uncertainty and still be able to control the machines, then we're going to have much better machines.\"\n\nThe MIT researchers' robot fish \"is a great demonstration of that principle,\" Trimmer says. \"It's an early stage of saying, 'We know the actuator isn't giving us all the control we'd like, but can we actually still exploit it to get the performance we want?' And they're able to show that yes, they can.\"\n\nExplore further: Robot-fish interact with live fish", "340": "Back to Health News\n\nColon Cancer Cases Decline for Older Americans\n\nAmerican Cancer Society report finds 30 percent drop between 2000-2010, tied to better screening Share | Comments: (0) Tell-a-Friend\n\nMONDAY, March 17, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Americans appear to be winning the war on colon cancer, with a new study finding that colon cancer rates among Americans aged 50 and older fell by about a third from 2000 to 2010.\n\nThe 30 percent decline is due to the growing use of colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer, say researchers from the American Cancer Society.\n\nThey found that at the same time that colon cancer cases were dropping, colonoscopy rates among adults ages 50 to 75 rose steeply -- from 19 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2010.\n\n\"These continuing drops in incidence and [death rates] show the lifesaving potential of colon cancer screening; a potential that an estimated 23 million Americans between ages 50 and 75 are not benefiting from because they are not up to date on screening,\" Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a society news release.\n\nAnother expert agreed. \"Our screening technologies seem to be preventing cancers from developing -- usually by detecting and removing polyps before they grow into cancer -- or catching cancers at an earlier stage, so that survival is vastly improved,\" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of inflammatory bowel disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"In 2014, there are estimated to be 135,000 new diagnoses of colon cancer [in the United States], but we hope to get the number much closer to zero by getting the at-risk population access to colorectal cancer screening over the coming years,\" Swaminath added.\n\nThe new analysis of U.S. national data revealed that overall colon cancer rates decreased by an average of 3.4 percent a year between 2001 and 2010.\n\nHowever, there were substantial differences in various age groups. Rates fell by 3.9 percent per year among those 50 and older, but rose by 1.1 percent a year among people younger than 50. That increase among younger adults may be due to rising obesity rates and poor eating habits, the cancer society noted.\n\nThe largest fall in colon cancer rates occurred among adults 65 and older. The rate of decline rose from 3.6 percent per year from 2001 to 2008 to 7.2 percent per year from 2008 to 2010. This is likely due to higher screening rates among Medicare-eligible seniors, the experts said.\n\nIn 2010, 64 percent of Americans 65 and older had undergone a recent colorectal cancer screening test, compared with 55 percent of adults ages 50 to 64, according to the study published in the March/April issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.\n\nThe researchers also found that colon cancer deaths are falling at a greater pace than in years previous. From 2001 to 2010, death rates fell by about 3 percent per year, compared with declines of about 2 percent per year in the 1990s.\n\nTwo other colon cancer experts said the new report is encouraging, but more work needs to be done.\n\nDespite significant reductions in colon cancer cases and deaths, \"significant disparities in outcomes exist among socioeconomic and racial groups,\" noted Dr. Rajiv Sharma, radiation oncologist at the North Shore-LIJ Cancer Institute in Lake Success, N.Y. \"A continued effort to improve universal access to screening, education, and best [cancer care] practices are imperative,\" he said.\n\nDr. Fadi Braiteh is an oncologist with Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, a US Oncology Network affiliate in Las Vegas. He noted that, \"every day this year, approximately 375 people will be diagnosed with colon cancer and about 130 will die from the disease.\"\n\nAccording to Braiteh, improvements in treatment advances in surgery, radiation therapy and drugs have also played a role in declining death rates from colon cancer. But not everyone is benefiting equally, he added.\n\n\"At each stage, cancer researchers are puzzled by the worse outcomes of ethnic minorities such as African Americans and Asians when compared to those of Caucasians,\" Braiteh said. \"It is not exclusively explained by health services disparities, and point to possible underlying biological differences among colon cancers.\"\n\nThe study and an accompanying report were released by American Cancer Society researchers as part of a new effort by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable to increase screening rates to 80 percent by 2018.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about colorectal cancer screening.\n\nSOURCES: Arun Swaminath, M.D., gastroenterologist and director of inflammatory bowel disease, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Rajiv Sharma, M.D, radiation oncologist, North Shore-LIJ Cancer Institute, Lake Success, N.Y.; Fadi Braiteh, M.D., oncologist, Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, a US Oncology Network affiliate, Las Vegas; American Cancer Society, news release, March 17, 2014\n\nReader comments on this article are listed below. Review our comments policy.", "341": "According to a new report from the American Cancer Society, rates of colorectal cancer - commonly called colon cancer - are decreasing steeply among older people in the US because of increasing use of colonoscopy screening, which can detect and remove precancerous growths.\n\nOver the last 10 years in the US, colon cancer incidence rates have fallen by 30% among people aged 50 and over, with the largest fall in those over 65.\n\nMeanwhile, use of colonoscopy screening has nearly tripled among those aged 50 to 75 - from 19% in 2000 to 55% in 2010.\n\nThese were the key findings of the latest issue of Colorectal Cancer Statistics 2014, which is due to be published in the March/April issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, and for which a companion report is available on the Society's website.\n\nThey are being released as part of a new initiative to push colon cancer screening rates up to 80% by 2018.\n\nScreening detects precancerous growths and early stages of colon cancer\n\nColon cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in the US. Yet because it grows slowly from precancerous polyps - small growths on the inner lining of the colon - there is an opportunity not available with many other cancers to prevent it by finding and removing these growths.\n\nColonoscopy screening - where the colon is examined with a camera - can also detect any cancer itself in the early stages, increasing the chance of successful treatment.\n\nFor the latest figures, the American Cancer Society researchers, led by Dr. Rebecca Siegel, drew on incidence data collected by two national programs: a surveillance program run by the National Cancer Institute and a program of cancer registries run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThey found that during the period of 2001 to 2010, overall rates of colon cancer incidence fell by an average of 3.4% per year.\n\nAmong the under 50s, colon cancer rates have risen slightly year on year\n\nHowever, within this average, the trends varied greatly by age. For instance, colon cancer rates fell by 3.9% per year among those aged 50 and over, but they went up by 1.1% per year among the under 50s.\n\nThe steady increase in colon cancer among those under 50 is mostly in cases where tumors developed in the distal colon and the rectum, which has been linked to increases in rates of obesity and unhealthy diets, say the report authors.\n\nThe most striking fall in colon cancer rates is among those aged 65 and over - where the decline has accelerated from 3.6% per year up to 2008 and then plummeted to 7.2% per year.\n\nThe authors suggest the sharper fall in colon cancer rates among seniors - who become eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 - is likely due to higher take up of screening because of universal insurance coverage:\n\n\"In 2010, 55% of adults aged 50 to 64 years reported having undergone a recent colorectal cancer screening test, compared with 64% of those aged 65 years and older.\"\n\nOverall deaths from colon cancer follow similar sharp decline\n\nRates of death from colon cancer in the past decade follow a similar sharp decline. Between 2001 and 2010, they fell by around 3% a year, compared with 2% in the 1990s.\n\nDr. Richard C.

That's enormous,\u201d said Rebecca Siegel, director of surveillance information for the American Cancer Society, and a co-author of the report.Typically, declines in cancer rates average 1% to 2% annually, Siegel said, but in the case of colon cancer it was closer to 4%, which the report attributes to widespread increases in colonoscopy screening over the years.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the use of colorectal cancer screenings increased from 19% to 55% among adults ages 50 to 75, the analysis found. In 2010, 64% of people age 65 years and older reported having undergone a recent screening test. \u201cColorectal cancer is one of the few cancers that we can actually prevent with screening, so it's a great opportunity,\u201d Siegel said.Despite the progress, researchers say there's still more work to do.\u201cThis is a really important and is a lifesaving test,\u201d said Siegel, \u201cbut we still have more than a third of adults for whom screening is recommended (who are) not getting tested, and others who say they have never been screened.\u201dScreening rates remain low among the poor and uninsured , the report said, and there were substantial racial and ethnic differences in both incidence and death rates. For example, the death rate for blacks was 50% higher than that of whites, attributed to disproportionately higher poverty rates in the black community.With more people gaining access to coverage as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Siegel says she hopes some of the disparities will be addressed. But in general, she says, she is often shocked by how unaware the public remains on the role they can play in prevention.\u201cColon cancer is one of the cancers we do know a lot about in terms of risk factors,\u201d she said noting that any effort to encourage patients to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, increase physical activity, eat plant-based diets low in red and processed meats and quit smoking can help.Colon cancer is currently the third leading cause of death for both men and women in the U.S. This year more than 136,000 individuals are projected to receive a colorectal cancer diagnosis, and more than 50,000 are projected to die from the disease.The CA report used colon cancer incidence data drawn from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.

To further reduce colon cancer cases and deaths, the American Cancer Society has set a goal of screening 80 percent of eligible people by 2018.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The cancer society estimates that 136,830 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease this year and that 50,310 will die from it.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we get the number much closer to zero by getting the at-risk population access to colorectal cancer screening,\u201d said Arun Swaminath, a gastroenterologist and director of inflammatory bowel disease at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nDeath rates from colon cancer have fallen, declining at a rate of about 3 percent a year during the past decade, the report found.

The government research group and maker of M&Ms and Snickers have teamed in the largest study ever to find out more about health benefits of cocoa flavanols, the main nutrients in dark chocolate. Earlier research on a smaller scale has shown that these ingredients lower the risk of stroke and heart attack.\n\nDaniel Clair, a urologist at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, points out that the cocoa bean is rich in plant nutrients.\n\n\u201cFlavonoids [including cocoa flavanols] help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this \u2018antioxidant\u2019 power, [which] can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\u201d\n\nCocoa and chocolate\u2014especially dark chocolate\u2014are known to lower blood pressure, control the body\u2019s use of insulin, improve artery health and blood flow to the brain, and enhance the ability of blood platelets to clot when needed.

Earlier research suggested this benefit but involved just older, unusually healthy men. Researchers want to see if multivitamins lower cancer risk in a broader population.\n\nThe study will be sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Mars Inc., maker of M&M\u2019s and Snickers bars.

Cocoa flavanols are often destroyed by the processing,\u201d said Manson, who will lead the study with Howard Sesso at Brigham and others at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n\nParticipants will get dummy pills or two capsules a day of cocoa flavanols for four years, and neither they nor the study leaders will know who is taking what during the study. The flavanol capsules are coated and have no taste, said Manson, who tried them herself.\n\nIn the other part of the study, participants will get dummy pills or daily multivitamins containing a broad range of nutrients.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from existing studies, which saves money and lets the study proceed much more quickly, Manson said, although some additional people with a strong interest in the research may be allowed to enrol.

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy.

Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\n\u201cCalifornia continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,\u201d California Assocation of Health Plans\u2019 Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement.", "361": "Obamacare short of enrollment target ahead of March 31 deadline\n\nBy Kate Randall\n\n18 March 2014\n\nThe Obama administration is conducting an all-out push to sign up new enrollees for the Affordable Care Act before the March 31 deadline. According to regulations of the legislation popularly known as Obamacare, those without insurance through their employer or a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid must obtain insurance by the end of this month, or pay a tax penalty in 2015.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported last week that about 940,000 people signed up for plans through Obamacare in February, bringing the total to about 4.2 million, far short of the Obama administration\u2019s original 5.7 million projection. People shopping for health insurance must select from plans offered by private insurers through the insurance exchanges set up under the ACA.\n\nIn addition to the overall low enrollment figures, the number of young people signing up is also far below original government forecasts. The administration had originally projected that those between the ages of 18 and 34 would account for 38.5 percent of enrollees. Of those signing up between October 1, 2013, and March 1 of this year, only 25 percent were in this age group.\n\nThe White House and private insurance companies are counting on young, healthy people signing up to offset the higher cost of insuring older, less healthy people. Insurance companies are depending on a sufficient influx of cash-paying, younger enrollees to maintain their profit margins. Under the ACA, the insurers are still allowed to charge three times as much for premiums for older enrollees.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to court young people have included an interview with \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host Ryan Seacrest on his radio program last Friday, which followed a March 11 appearance on the comedy interview web series \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifiankis.\u201d The president\u2019s last-ditch maneuvers are taking on an increasingly desperate and cynical character.\n\nThe latest marketing campaign by administration health care officials focuses on \u201cMarch Madness,\u201d the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments that begin this week. Beginning Monday, Obama, some of his aides, and celebrity basketball players and coaches will conduct interviews, feature in public service ads and make appeals on social media. Obama was set to release Monday night a \u201c16 Sweetest Reasons to get Covered\u201d bracket modeled on the predictions for winners of the NCAA tournament.\n\nIn an effort to target the Hispanic audience, Obama was scheduled to appear Monday on the Univision Radio program \u201cLocura Deportive\u201d (Sports Madness), while ESPN Deportes will interview White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.\n\nIn an interview Friday on the popular health information site WebMD, the president stated he was confident enough people have signed up for Obamacare to make the program \u201cstable.\u201d However, pointing to the main purpose of his interview, he stressed \u201cthe more you can spread the risk with more people, the better deal you\u2019re going to get.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know, the impact in terms of the program has always been based more on the mix of people who sign up.\u201d\n\nWhile touting the law\u2019s virtues, he acknowledged that lower-cost policies on the health care exchanges may have limited choices of doctors and other providers. \u201cFor the average person,\u201d Obama said, \u201cmany folks don\u2019t have insurance initially, they\u2019re going to have to make some choices. And they may have to switch doctors, in part because they\u2019re saving money.\u201d\n\nThe president added that people may discover that a network \u201cis more expensive than another network, and maybe you\u2019ve got to make a choice about what\u2019s right for your family.\u201d In other words, the substandard plans are the only thing you and your family can afford, but because of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d you must purchase it or pay a penalty.\n\nA survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Company reports that only about a quarter of the 4.2 million people signing up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges through February were previously uninsured. This means that the program has so far made only a tiny dent in the estimated 48 million uninsured Americans.\n\nThe survey also found that of those shopping on the exchanges, only about half actually signed up for coverage, citing high premium prices as the reason for not buying insurance. They failed to enroll after visiting an online exchange despite the fact that four in five of this group qualified for government subsidies to purchase insurance under Obamacare.\n\nIn an appearance last month before the House Ways and Means Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated that ACA \u201cpremiums are likely to go up, but at a smaller pace than what we\u2019ve seen since 2010.\u201d While she failed to specify precisely what this \u201csmaller pace\u201d would look like in practice on the exchanges, other data on insurance premiums indicates private insurers will be hiking premiums substantially.\n\nAccording to a report from eHealthInsurance, an online private insurance exchange, Americans purchasing coverage outside the Obamacare exchanges are seeing premiums up to 56 percent higher than before the health law took effect. The report shows families paying an average of $663 a month, with premiums as high as $2,604 a month for a family in California, and $1,845 in New York.\n\nAccording to eHealthInsurance, rates have jumped as insurers shift the cost of covering the added features of the ACA to consumers. While the insurers are now required to cover certain essential health benefits, and cannot deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions, they are not sacrificing their profits to do so. This is placing individuals and families who are not insured through their employers, and in general do not qualify for government subsidies, in an impossible financial position.\n\nA substantial number of people facing these huge premium hikes are those whose insurance was cancelled because it did not meet the ACA standards. The White House faced a backlash last year when several million people received notices of cancellation, contradicting Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nThese people were eventually given the option of keeping their plans temporarily in those states where insurance commissions allowed it. In the latest reported tweak to the health care law, these people have now been given a permanent exemption from the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nYou can now fill out a form attesting that you \u201cbelieve that the plan options available in the [ACA] Marketplace in your area are more expensive than your cancelled health insurance policy\u201d or \u201cyou consider other available policies unaffordable.\u201d In other words, you will be exempted from the requirement to purchase qualified insurance, and can dodge the penalty, but you will be left without any health coverage whatsoever.\n\nFight Google's censorship!

The Department of Health and Human Services reported today that five million people have now signed up for insurance through the government exchanges. The administration had hoped to enroll seven million by the March 31 deadline. After the bungled rollout, that estimate was revised down to six million.\n\nWhile total sign-ups still lag both targets, the pace is picking up slightly, as the administration had hoped would be the case in the final weeks and days of open enrollment. 800,000 people applied for coverage so far in March, compared to 1.1 million in all of February. The latest release does not report the ages of enrollees, information that has been closely watched by the administration and insurers. Of particular interest is the percentage of sign-ups who are between the ages of 18 and 34, a healthy demographic needed to keep costs down.\n\n\n\nMany are quick to point out the headline enrollment numbers obscure the more meaningful data on how many plans have actually been purchased.

The official number of those who have enrolled and completed their first payment has not yet been released.\n\n", "363": "(Adds California figures, final two paragraphs)\n\nBy David Morgan\n\nWASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under the law known as Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1, the Obama administration said on Monday.\n\nWith the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe last several days have been the busiest since December,\u201d Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.\n\nThe 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.\n\nThe CBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage, but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.\n\nMonday\u2019s release did not say how many new enrollees were adults aged 18 to 34, a younger demographic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nBefore the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance marketplaces to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to ensure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n\u201cFive million is only a good number if it\u2019s mostly people who didn\u2019t have insurance before,\u201d said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMARCH 31 DEADLINE\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law\u2019s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. With huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.\n\nSeparately, California\u2019s state health insurance exchange said on Monday its enrollment passed the 1 million mark, with 1,018,315 people selecting a health plan through the exchange as of Saturday. Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\n\u201cCalifornia continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,\u201d California Assocation of Health Plans\u2019 Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement. (Editing by Chris Reese, Mohammad Zargham and Peter Cooney)", "364": "The administration is claiming a limited victory by saying the number of those enrolled in ObamaCare has now hit 5 million with two weeks to go until the March 31 deadline. If accurate, the number does represent a steep increase over the 4.2 million that were said to have signed up at the beginning of the month. At this rate, administration cheerleaders reason, the goal of 7 million enrolled in the Affordable Care Act may yet be reached at some point in the near future, if not quite on time. This burst of enrollments is seen as a vindication of President Obama\u2019s all-out push to promote the law including such questionable activities as appearing on the \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d web show where he traded barbs with comedian Zach Galifianakis.\n\nBut before the president and his team start popping the champagne corks to celebrate their achievement and their faux hipness, it\u2019s time once again to point out that the administration\u2019s Potemkin enrollment figures should be read with a truckload of salt. As the New York Times reported last month, as much as 20 percent of all those enrolled had not actually paid their premiums, meaning they were not covered by the program. While Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress she had no idea what the numbers of unpaid enrollees were, more states are reporting these figures and, as CNBC reported last week, the results are literally all over the map. While some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.\n\nAll this calls in to question not only the effectiveness of the sales job done by the president and celebrity supporters such as Lebron James. It also means that the odds that this system can sustain itself without mandating vast increases in rates for those who do pay are getting slimmer every day.\n\nFor months we\u2019ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a \u201cglitchy\u201d website that had since been fixed. But what has since become clear is that the effort to convince young and healthy Americans to sign up for insurance that is both expensive and not something they may need is a failure. Though many of those who clearly benefit from the new health law, such as the poor and those with pre-existing conditions, have signed up, the scheme requires large numbers of those who won\u2019t need the coverage as often in order to be economically viable. That problem will be exacerbated by the failure of much larger percentages of customers to pay for their insurance.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted previously, the non-payment of the premium is not a technicality. Many of those purchasing the insurance may be first-time buyers and not understand that they must pay their bill before coverage starts rather than long after the fact, as they can with a credit card transaction. Or it may be that some enrolled with no intention of paying or thinking that the hype about the glories of ObamaCare they\u2019ve heard in the mainstream media and from the president absolved them of the obligation to pay for it. But either way, the large number of non-payments renders the enrollment figures meaningless and ensures that the rates for those who do pay are going up next year by percentages that will shock them.\n\nThe president claimed that the number of enrollees has already reached the point where the law will work rather than collapse from lack of participation. But even if we accept his premise that falling millions of customers short of the announced goal of seven million is no big deal, the fact that hundreds of thousands of those being counted in the pool of those he\u2019s counting are not covered because of non-payment of premiums makes his assertion a colossal fraud.\n\nThe president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare. But if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security. Until we get a full accounting not only of those who signed up on a website but completed the process by paying for the plan they chose, we\u2019ll have no idea how many people truly are enrolled. Seen in that light, the president\u2019s enrollment promises may well turn out to be no different from other pledges he has made about the ACA in the last few years: completely untrue.", "365": "The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31.

Under the law\u2019s individual mandate, Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance by April 1 will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income, unless they apply for a hardship exemption.\n\nPeople can qualify for the exemption if they are experiencing a financial hardship that could make it difficult to obtain health coverage. The administration announced an extension of the exemption through 2016 last week. Critics say it could make it easier for people to skirt around the new requirement, and it can also make people less likely to get coverage.\n\nRelated: Why There May Be a New Obamacare Delay\n\nThough they are still far from reaching their enrollment projections, administration officials are touting the numbers as a success, and say they are confident that sign ups will continue to surge ahead of the open enrollment deadline.\n\n\"The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -- the busiest day since December 23 -- and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend,\u201d Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a blog published Monday.\n\nRelated: 10 Top Questions Consumers Ask About Obamacare\n\nAnother important question the figures do not answer is how many of the new enrollees previously lacked health coverage. This is important since a key goal of the healthcare reform law was to extend access to coverage for the millions of uninsured Americans. One independent study by McKinsey found that just 27 percent of total enrollment through February were previously uninsured.\n\nIf this is accurate, the majority of people signing up for Obamacare either had an employer plan previously and were kicked off, or they found a better deal on the exchanges.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "368": "With two weeks left to register, officials said Monday that Obamacare signups now have hit the 5 million mark, perhaps putting enrollment goals within reach.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the milestone on her blog Monday. Tavenner said the 5 million mark was reached over the weekend, a little less than three weeks after CMS officials announced on Feb. 25 they had reached 4 million enrollees. That February mark was reached slightly more than one month after enrollment hit 3 million on Jan. 24.\n\nWith the March 31 deadline to enlist in Obamacare, the pace of enrollment clearly is quickening, putting new expectations of 6 million signups now in sight for the Affordable Care Act through public exchanges. The 6 million goal was lowered by the Congressional Budget Office from 7 million after difficulties with HealthCare.gov prompted researchers to rethink the numbers.\n\nA brisk campaign waged by President Obama along with members of his administration hopes to boost enrollment via either a handful of state-run exchanges or the federal HealthCare.gov site.

Insurance industry experts have estimated that between 15 to 20 percent of enrollees have not paid yet, and one expert told CNBC.com he expects that after open enrollment closes, about 10 percent of Obamacare ernollees will end up not paying for the plans they selected.\n\nCMS also did not disclose what percentage of the 5 million sign-ups have come from people who previously had insurance.

Wal-Mart also offers games and consoles at its stores but has so far been unable to take market share from GameStop.\n\nWal-Mart is well known for its low-price strategy and also offers a variety of items for shoppers, whereas GameStop offers just video games and consoles. Exchanging used games for store credit might be more lucrative for customers who are not just looking to trade in their old game for another game but can use the store credit to buy other items such as groceries or apparel. Electronics or entertainment items account for around 10% of Wal-Mart\u2019s revenues, but it still has a market share of 15% in consumer electronics. On the other hand, Best Buy, which specializes in consumer electronics, has a market share of 22%. [ ]\n\nHowever, GameStop has a loyal customer base, with over 31 million PowerUp Reward members. The company offers special deals and has built up good relations with its customers. For example, during the launch of Disney Infinity, GameStop offered customers the opportunity to pre-order over $400 worth of characters playable in the game. GameStop was also the only U.S. retailer to offer the exclusive $150 collector\u2019s edition of Grand Theft Auto V. The loyalty of this base and the specialization in the niche video game market is GameStop\u2019s biggest strong point, which might help it ward off the Wal-Mart threat.\n\nUnlike Best Buy, GameStop has been relatively unfazed by the \u2018showrooming\u2019 phenomena, whereby customers go to a brick and mortar store to see a product and eventually buy from online retailers like Amazon and eBay. The company\u2019s market share has remained largely unchanged for the last few years.\n\nGameStop\u2019s used game sales are highly correlated with new game sales, as the latter help replenish the company\u2019s inventory; pre-owned game sales have consistently been around 65% of new software sales for the last four years. We expect the company to suffer a minor loss in market share, but it will still be able to gain as the new-console cycle progresses. We expect a 5% increase in used game sales through the coming years, but there is a 15% downside to our price estimate for GameStop should the growth be below 3% through the decade.\n\nSee More at Trefis | View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis)", "372": "Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\nGameStop shares fell today more than 5 percent one day after Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, announced plans to enter the $2 billion used game market.

But why trade these games in at Wal-Mart instead of GameStop or Best Buy?\n\nWal-Mart's \"true differentiator,\" Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can't compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It's credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.\n\nWal-Mart will accept all games (provided they are not scratched or damaged beyond repair) and refurbish them via a third-party company. These games will then be sold at stores and online with a \"certified pre-owned\" label on their packaging. Wal-Mart expects to have a solid inventory of secondhand games available this summer.\n\nGameStop has its own dedicated refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas and it is this very operation that management believes sets GameStop apart from competitors. We've reached out to Gamestop for comment on this story but we have not heard back.\n\nJust because Wal-Mart is getting into the used game market, it doesn't mean the company is backing away from new games anytime soon. The company's new release business will \"remain a focus\" for Wal-Mart going forward, Mac Naughton said.\n\nBut why get into the secondhand market now, in 2014, when an increasing amount of attention is paid to download services? It's a question we poised to Mac Naughton and he said Wal-Mart isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many. Still, he explained that Wal-Mart is indeed eyeing the digital market as a future growth opportunity.\n\n\"We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,\" he said. \"We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.\"\n\nWal-Mart's move into the used-game market will also conceivably affect publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, which do not participate in second-hand sales. We've also reached out to these companies, but have not heard back. We'll have more in the future.\n\nFinally, though Mac Naughton never mentioned GameStop by name during the call, he said Wal-Mart's aim with its secondhand program is to \"pay more than anybody else\" for your old games. Of course, trade-in prices will vary, but he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.\n\nHere's how Wal-Mart's used-game program works:", "378": "It\u2019s like a scene straight from one of the video games it sells.\n\nGameStop, the biggest seller of used video games, opened its doors Tuesday to find the world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart, was taking aim at one of its main lines of business.\n\nWalmart said Tuesday it will step up its game and start offering store credit to customers who trade in used video games.\n\nScared by the upcoming battle, investors sent shares of Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop down 3.4 percent, to $38.39, Tuesday.\n\nThe used video-game business is a lucrative one, and GameStop likely has no intention of backing down.\n\n\u201cOur buy-sell-trade program creates a unique value proposition to our customers by providing our customers with an opportunity to trade in their pre-owned video game products and mobile devices for store credits and apply those credits toward other merchandise, which in turn, increases sales,\u201d the company said in its most recent 10K regulatory filing.\n\nThere are roughly 2.3 billion used games in circulation, GameStop estimates, so there is not likely to be a shortage any time soon.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why customers like buying second-hand video games. The average price of a used video game is $19 at GameStop, compared with $41 for a new one, according to the company.\n\nAs of December 2012, the company had 3,100 different used video-game titles in its inventory throughout its 6,600 stores.\n\nRoughly 27 percent, or $2.4 billion, of its total revenue of $8.9 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2013, came from used video games, the company said.", "379": "GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has had a challenging time from attacks on its business on all fronts \u2014 online sales, freemium games versus premium games, and big-box retail efforts. Now its shares were getting bruised on Tuesday on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is directly targeting the GameStop model with a new push with its trade-in service and preowned game offerings.\n\nWalmart said in its press release that it wants to offer the 110 million-plus gamers in the United States a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and to save on video game spending. Walmart said:\n\nStarting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.\n\nWalmart even said that it is \u201cactively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.\u201d And as far as the GameStop targeting, the company may not have been named directly but Walmart said:\n\nWhen we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They\u2019ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\n\nWhat matters here is that some 3,100 stores will participate, and even more importantly that the credit can be used on the purchase of any merchandise at Walmart and Sam\u2019s stores. GameStop\u2019s used vide game turn-in credit for customers is for GameStop purchases.\n\nAs far as what the market thinks about the new competition, it isn\u2019t pretty. GameStop shares were down more than 5% and were still down closer to 4.4% at $38.00 on last look.\n\nGameStop shares have traded in a 52-week range of $24.89 to $57.74, and the consensus price target prior to this news was just above $50.00.\n\nSo, can GameStop survive this effort? Most likely yes, but with some pain and competition.", "380": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will start buying used video games from customers next week, setting its sights on a business perfected by Grapevine-based GameStop Corp.\n\nChief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart wants to pay more for used games than any other buyer.\n\nBeginning March 26, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in video games played on Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. The credit can be applied immediately toward the purchase of anything sold at Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club, both in stores and online.\n\nVideo games will be refurbished and sent back to stores in new packaging and sold as used games. Wal-Mart expects to start selling used games sometime this summer, depending on the inventory it collects, Mac Naughton said.\n\nGameStop has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year.\n\n\u201cWe have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,\u201d GameStop said in a prepared statement. \u201cGiven our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We\u2019ve beat out other large retailers when they\u2019ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nUsed games still represent about 30 percent of GameStop\u2019s annual sales and about 40 percent of its profits.\n\nMany other retailers exited or downplayed the video game segment because the industry seemed to be moving rapidly toward digital gaming. GameStop built up its digital business, strengthened its used business and amassed 30 million PowerUp reward program members.\n\nSuccessful launches of the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 during the holiday shopping season signaled that gamers still aren\u2019t willing to give up their hardware and software.\n\nGameStop promoted its buyback program during the launch of the pricey new consoles. Trade-ins allowed customers to get a break on the consoles, which cost $500 and $400 and weren\u2019t being discounted.\n\nBest Buy also buys used games.\n\nWal-Mart is trying to build up its used business now because the Xbox One and PS4 are expected to have strong sales over the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cGaming continues to be an important business for us, and we\u2019re actively taking aim at the $2 billion preowned video game opportunity,\u201d Mac Naughton said. \u201cWhen we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They\u2019ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\u201d\n\nThere are almost 1 billion games sitting around in homes, and 8 out of 10 are not being played, said Laura Phillips, senior vice president of entertainment for Wal-Mart U.S. \u201cCustomers are sitting on cash they can use at Wal-Mart,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nWal-Mart recently entered the used-merchandise business, selling everything from refurbished TVs to smartphones.\n\nFollow Maria Halkias on Twitter at @MariaHalkias.", "381": "For the last decade or so, we\u2019ve heard about the alleged health benefits of eating dark chocolate, including lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol levels. Those claims are about to be put to an exhaustive test in a study of 18,000 adults in Boston and Seattle. But instead of eating chocolate bars every day, the study participants will take capsules containing concentrated amounts of the bio-active chemicals in cocoa beans, known as cocoa flavanols.\n\nIf study results are consistent with previous studies showing health benefits of eating cocoa flavanols, it will be a semi-sweet outcome for chocolate lovers. Generally, the higher the level of cocoa, the less sweet the chocolate -- though even chocolate with 72% cocoa contains in the neighborhood of 240 calories per serving, including 10 grams of sugar and 18 grams of fat.\n\nThe study participants will theoretically get all of the good stuff without the extra calories from fat and sugar. Each participant will take two flavorless capsules a day containing 750 milligrams of cocoa flavanols (or dummy pills for those in the control group) for four years. Over that time, participants' heart health will be monitored to determine if the mega dose of cocoa does what previous, smaller studies indicate. To ingest the same amount of cocoa flavanols as the study participants would require eating almost five bars of dark chocolate a day.\n\nCocoa is thought to benefit heart health by acting as a vasodilator, meaning it triggers relaxation of muscle cells within blood vessel walls. Relaxed blood vessels naturally widen, resulting in greater blood flow and decreased blood pressure.\n\nThe latest research is being funded by Mars Inc., makers of M&Ms and other candies, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Mars co-sponsoring the study will raise red flags with critics, but it\u2019s worth noting that the company has funded cocoa flavanol research since the 1990s, and much of what we know about the possible benefits of cocoa has emerged from Mars-supported studies.\n\nThe company already sells a line of products based on earlier research, called CocoaVia, including 250mg cocoa extract capsules.\n\nYou can find David DiSalvo on Twitter @neuronarrative and at his website, The Daily Brain.

Colonoscopy use has almost tripled among adults ages 50 to 75, from 19 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2010.\n\nDeath rates from colon cancer have also declined rapidly within the last decade. The report says even more deaths could be avoided if everyone got their screening tests on time.\n\nThe findings come from Colorectal Cancer Statistics, 2014, published in the March/April issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.\n\nThe article and its companion report, Colorectal Cancer Facts & Figures, were released today by American Cancer Society researchers as part of a new initiative by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable to increase screening rates to 80 percent by 2018.\n\nColorectal cancer, commonly called colon cancer, is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. Its slow growth from precancerous polyp to invasive cancer provides a rare opportunity to prevent cancer through the detection and removal of precancerous growths.\n\nScreening also allows early detection of cancer, when treatment is more successful. As a result, screening reduces colorectal cancer mortality both by decreasing the incidence of disease and by increasing the likelihood of survival.\n\nUsing incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries, as provided by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), researchers led by Rebecca Siegel, MPH found that during the most recent decade of data (2001 to 2010), overall incidence rates decreased by an average of 3.4 percent per year.\n\nHowever, trends vary substantially by age. Rates declined by 3.9 percent per year among adults aged 50 years and older, but increased by 1.1 percent per year among men and women younger than 50. That increase was confined to tumors in the distal colon and rectum, patterns for which a rise in obesity and emergence of unfavorable dietary patterns has been implicated.\n\nMost strikingly, the rate of decline has surged among those 65 and older, with the decline accelerating from 3.6 percent per year during 2001-2008 to 7.2 percent per year during 2008-2010.\n\nThe \"larger declines among Medicare-eligible seniors likely reflect higher rates of screening because of universal insurance coverage,\" the authors write. \"In 2010, 55 percent of adults aged 50 to 64 years reported having undergone a recent colorectal cancer screening test, compared with 64 percent of those aged 65 years and older.\"\n\nLike incidence, mortality rates have also declined most rapidly within the past decade. From 2001 to 2010, rates decreased by approximately 3 percent per year in both men and women, compared with declines of approximately 2 percent per year during the 1990s.\n\n\"These continuing drops in incidence and mortality show the lifesaving potential of colon cancer screening; a potential that an estimated 23 million Americans between ages 50 and 75 are not benefiting from because they are not up to date on screening,\" said Richard C. Wender, M.D., American Cancer Society chief cancer control officer.\n\n\"Sustaining this hopeful trend will require concrete efforts to make sure all patients, particularly those who are economically disenfranchised, have access to screening and to the best care available.\"\n\nThe data is being released at the launch of a nationwide effort to increase colorectal cancer screening rates to 80% by 2018. Public health leaders, including Assistant Secretary for Health Howard Koh, MD, MPH and American Cancer Society CEO, John R. Seffrin, PhD will join dozens of members of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable (NCCRT) at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on today.\n\nThe NCCRT, an organization co-founded by the American Cancer Society and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will focus on dramatically increasing colorectal cancer screening rates in the U.S. over the next four years, and increasing awareness of the potential for early detection and prevention of this cancer.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe American Cancer Society is one of dozens of groups joining together to launch an effort to increase the nation's colorectal cancer screening rate to 80 percent by the year 2018.

Researchers attributed the decline primarily to wider and earlier screening among older patients.\n\nBloomberg News/Landov Good news: A colonoscopy isn\u2019t nearly this complicated.\n\nColon cancer will account for about 50,000 deaths this year, according to the society, and the National Institutes of Health have estimated that treatment costs in the U.S. reach $14 billion a year. It remains the third-leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.; it\u2019s somewhat more common among men than among women. But since the turn of the millennium, the death rate from the disease among people over 50 has declined by about 3% per year, to 13.3 deaths per year 100,000 people for women and 19.2 deaths per 100,000 people for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProactive patients and doctors have themselves to thank for the mortality decrease. Increased use of colonoscopies and other kinds of screening has led to more cancers being caught in their earlier, more treatable stages, and to more precancerous polyps being spotted and removed before they turn into something malignant.\n\nColonoscopy, of course, has become a byword for the kind of unpleasant medical procedure that you\u2019d just as soon avoid. (See also: \u201croot canal.\u201d) But cancer researchers see a direct relationship between declining colorectal cancers and greater discipline among consumers about screening. In 2000, only 19% of Americans aged 50 to 75 had had at least one colonoscopy in their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society; by 2010, that figure had risen to 55%.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people over 50 get at least one colonoscopy every 10 years (with more frequent screening for those with a family history of the disease).\n\nFrustratingly enough, getting insurance to cover a colonoscopy isn\u2019t as much of a slam-dunk as it ought to be. Melinda Beck reports today in The Wall Street Journal that although the Affordable Care Act requires many insurance policies to cover colon-cancer screening in its entirety, on the grounds that it constitutes preventive medicine, Medicare and many insurers start charging co-payments once a patient has had polyps removed.\n\nOne other dark cloud in the forecast: Colon-cancer diagnoses are rising among people under 50, although not as quickly as older Americans\u2019 rates are falling. Researchers speculate that declining exercise and rising obesity rates are to blame.\n\nAlso on Encore:\n\nThe serious risks of sitting\n\nTo retire well, watch this balance, too\n\nWhy it pays to drive like a grandpa\n\nMatthew Heimer covers retirement for MarketWatch, and edits the Encore blog.

These findings were recently published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and its companion piece, Colorectal Cancer Facts & Figures 2014\u20132016.\n\nColon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, as well as the third most common cause of cancer deaths among Americans (both men and women). At current rates, approximately 1 in 20 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer in their lifetime.\n\nAs of January 1, 2012, there were almost 1.2 million colon cancer survivors in the U.S.\n\nThe report attributes this significant drop in cancer rates to the rise in colonoscopy screenings, which search for cancer or pre-cancer in people without any symptoms.\n\nLearn How Researchers Are Finding New Cancer Treatments \u00bb\n\nGetting Screenings On Time Is Crucial\n\nSurvival rates for colon cancer have also improved rapidly in the last decade. And according to the report, if everyone had their screening tests when recommended, even more deaths could be prevented.\n\nIn a statement, Richard C. Wender, M.D., the ACS's chief cancer control officer, said, \u201cThese continuing drops in incidence and mortality show the lifesaving potential of colon cancer screening; a potential that an estimated 20 million of Americans over 50, who have never been screened, have not benefitted from.\u201d\n\nWender added, \u201cContinuing this hopeful trend will require concrete efforts to make sure all patients, particularly those who are economically disenfranchised, have access to screening and to the best care available.\u201d\n\nGet the Facts: What Is Colorectal Cancer? \u00bb\n\nColonoscopies Save Lives\n\nColonoscopy use has almost tripled among adults aged 50 to 75, from 19 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2010. Still, in 2010, only 59 percent of people aged 50 or older reported being up to date with their screenings for colon cancer.\n\nThese screenings prevent cancer because they help doctors identify pre-cancerous growths, called polyps, in the colon and rectum. Most polyps do not turn into cancer; however, removing them can prevent cancer from developing. Regular screening also increases the chances of finding cancer earlier, when it\u2019s easier to treat.\n\nA coalition of more than 70 public, private, and voluntary organizations, led by the ACS and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is working to focus efforts on increasing colon screening rates in the U.S. to 80 percent by 2018.\n\nRead More About Colorectal Polyps \u00bb\n\nMost people diagnosed with colon cancer are over 50 years old. The American Cancer Society recommends that colon cancer screening begin at age 50 for people who are at average risk. People who have certain risk factors that make them more likely to develop colon cancer (for instance, inflammatory bowel disease or a family history of the colon cancer) are advised to get screened earlier and to get tested more often than other people.", "391": "Over the past decade colon cancer rates have dropped 30 percent in the U.S. among over 50s thanks to an \"uptake\" in colonoscopies.\n\nColonoscopy use has almost tripled in adults between the ages of 50 and 75; the rate jumped from 19 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2010, an American Cancer Society news release reported.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. Since it grows relatively slowly, early detection and removal of precancerous growths could greatly influence the survival rate; frequent screening helps promote early detection.\n\nOver the past 10 years the overall number of colon cancer cases has decreased by about 3.4 percent per year. \"Rates declined by 3.9 percent per year among adults aged 50 years and older, but increased by 1.1 percent per year among men and women younger than 50,\" the news release reported.\n\nThe decline in colon cancer cases has been especially prevalent in adults over 65, which was at 7.2 percent between the years of 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"[The] larger declines among Medicare-eligible seniors likely reflect higher rates of screening because of universal insurance coverage,\" the authors wrote, according to the news release. \"In 2010, 55 percent of adults aged 50 to 64 years reported having undergone a recent colorectal cancer screening test, compared with 64 percent of those aged 65 years and older.\"\n\nMortality rates from colon cancer have also declined over the past decade, which have decreased by about three percent per year.\n\n\"These continuing drops in incidence and mortality show the lifesaving potential of colon cancer screening; a potential that an estimated 23 million Americans between ages 50 and 75 are not benefiting from because they are not up to date on screening,\" Richard C. Wender, M.D., American Cancer Society chief cancer control officer, said in the news release. \"Sustaining this hopeful trend will require concrete efforts to make sure all patients, particularly those who are economically disenfranchised, have access to screening and to the best care available.\"", "392": "These dramatic declines are due to an equally dramatic increase in people getting screened for colon cancer. In 2000, only 19 percent of adults ages 50 to 75 had been screened. That jumped to 65 percent as of last November, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut that still means that about 1 in 3 adults has not been screened. And the cancer society estimates that this year there will be nearly 137,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 deaths.\n\n\"That's why we have started a national push to achieve an 80 percent screening rate by 2018,\" Richard C. Wender, M.D., chief cancer control officer for the cancer society, said in an interview.\n\nSome 40 percent of colorectal cancer cases could be prevented if people underwent regular colonoscopy screening, according to a large, long-term study released last year by the Harvard School of Public Health. Regular screening also means that the cancer can be caught early, when the five-year survival rate is 90 percent. The more advanced the cancer, the lower the survival rate.\n\nThe colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detecting either cancer or precancerous polyps that can be snipped off before they cause problems. To view these potential trouble spots, the doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera into the colon. Unfortunately, the only way a doctor can get a clear picture is if the colon has been cleansed using laxatives the day before \u2014 admittedly the biggest downside to the procedure.\n\nWender agrees that the laxative prep is \"annoying.\"\n\n\"But it's not painful. And the colonoscopy itself is always accompanied by medication that makes it comfortable and pain-free,\" he added.\n\nHe also says there are other screening options. If you're at average risk \u2014 meaning no family history of colon cancer and no personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 there are some alternatives to having a colonoscopy every 10 years.", "393": "Colon cancer rates are on the decline, as they have been since the mid-1980s and have further plunged by 30 percent over the last decade among Americans 50-years-old and older. A new study cites colonoscopies for the decline.\n\nColon cancer related death rates have also fallen as well, declining about 3 percent a year between 2001 and 2010, compared with 2 percent a year in the previous decade, according to the American Cancer Society study of government data.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Chief Medical Officer Otis Brawley estimates that without screening efforts that have become widespread after beginning in the 1980s, \u201cwe\u2019d be seeing twice as many deaths today. This study celebrates the fact that we\u2019ve almost halved the mortality rate from colon cancer in the last 35 years.\u201d\n\nDespite the dramatic drop, colon cancer remains the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. More than 136,000 new cases develop each year and about 50,000 deaths related to it.\n\nThe study found the decline was particularly present among elder Americans. The rate of colon cancer among those 65 and older dropped about 7 percent a year from 2008 to 2010. Americans are also clearly taking their health screenings seriously, as the percentage of Americans who are up-to-date on recommended colon-cancer screening rose from 55 percent to 65 percent in just the past decade.\n\nScreenings for breast and prostate cancer have felt the heat in recent years for over-diagnosing malignancies \u2013 in other words, finding a significant number of early cancers that would never cause harm if left untreated, leading to unnecessary treatment. Colon cancer screening has remained less controversial.\n\n\u201cWith colon cancer, it\u2019s not so much screening to find early cancers but screening to find polyps and remove them, which prevents cancer,\u201d said James Church, a colorectal cancer surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, who did not take part in this new study.", "394": "A recent study shows that fewer older Americans are being diagnosed with colon cancer. For those aged 50 and up, findings show a 30 percent drop thanks to screenings and new uptake of colonoscopies.\n\nResearchers note that colonoscopy use has tripled among adults between the age group of 50 and 75, when in 2000, the screening rate was just at 19 percent. Yet by 2010, it increased to 55 percent.\n\n\"This is one of the great public health success stories of the decade,\" said Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society, via USA Today.\n\nInformation on Colorectal Cancer statistics for 2014 show that screenings may increase up to 80 percent by 2018.\n\n\"We hope that we get the number much closer to zero by getting the at-risk population access to colorectal cancer screening,\" said Arun Swaminath, a gastroenterologist and director of inflammatory bowel disease at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study, according to USA Today.\n\nAs colon cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of death in the United States, screenings can help to catch precancerous polyps with the potential to turn into invasive cancer.\n\nHealth officials note that if detection of cancerous areas are caught early, treatments can be more successful, and potentially, more life-saving.\n\nMore information regarding the study was based on data from the National Cancer Institutes's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries.", "395": "Declining incidences of colon cancer in America fell by another 30 percent during the past decade as more older Americans benefited from colonoscopy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society on Monday released new data showing that colon cancer deaths are also dropping at an accelerating rate. Deaths fell by three percent per year during the past decade, following two percent annual drops the previous decade.\n\nThe declining rates reflect the widespread adoption of colon cancer screenings begun in the 1980s. Had times not changed, \u201cwe\u2019d be seeing twice as many deaths today,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cThis study celebrates the fact that we\u2019ve almost halved the mortality rate from colon cancer in the last 35 years.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nYet colon cancer remains the third most common in America \u2014 and the third most deadly. Oncologists expect 136,000 new cases of colon cancer this year with 50,000 deaths. Meanwhile, African-Americans continue to suffer a disproportionately higher risk of colon cancer, a reflection not necessarily of poorer access to health care but of stronger hereditary risk, researchers say. In the U.S., blacks suffer a 25 percent higher risk than whites and a 50 percent higher risk than Asian-Americans.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that people ages 50 and older should receive one of three types of screenings for colon cancer, which include a colonoscopy every 10 years, a stool test every year, or a sigmoidoscopy every five years in combination with stool tests every three to five years.\n\nThough doctors recommend any of the three screening regimens, colonoscopy has proven the most popular method as Americans become increasingly comfortable with the procedure. By 2010, 55 percent of Americans ages 50 to 75 had undergone at least one colonoscopy, a jump from only 19 percent a decade earlier.\n\n\u201cThese continuing drops in incidence and mortality show the lifesaving potential of colon cancer screening; a potential that an estimated 20 million of Americans over 50, who have never been screened, have not benefitted from,\u201d said Dr. Richard C. Wender, of the American Cancer Society, in a statement. \u201cContinuing this hopeful trend will require concrete efforts to make sure all patients, particularly those who are economically disenfranchised, have access to screening and to the best care available.\u201d\n\nWender also mentioned the greater ease of the new \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy, by which doctors replace the invasive fiber-optic camera with a simple CT scan. The new technique also requires no anesthesia, a necessary component of the non-virtual colonoscopy.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to provide colonoscopy with no copays, to encourage the most widespread use of screenings. Yet Medicare still does not pay for virtual colonoscopy, the American Cancer Society notes.", "396": "Sony has just unveiled a prototype Virtual Reality (VR) headset which will work with the PlayStation 4 at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco.\n\nThe black and white Virtual Reality headset codenamed Project Morpheus was shown off at the annual gathering of game designers at an event titled 'Driving the Future of Innovation'.\n\nProject Morpheus is named after the Greek god of dreams and features a head-mounted display with 1080p resolution and a 90-degree field of view. The headset comes with built-in sensors to track the wearer's head movement in sync with the PlayStation Camera and PlayStation Move for motion control.\n\nThe virtual reality headset can connect to a PS4 console via USB or directly to your television via an HDMI port. Though the existing prototype uses a 5 metre cable, Sony is apparently planning to go wireless with the consumer release.\n\nPrice and Release Date\n\nVirtual reality is seen by many as the next big thing in gaming technology with the Oculus Rift expected to be the first major device to be launched on the market. The Oculus Rift is expected to be released to the public before the end of 2014 or early in 2015.\n\nSony has yet to release details of when Project Morpheus will be launched or how much it will cost.\n\nAs ArsTechnica reports, with a space of 15mm to 25mm between the eye and the lens, the unit is said to be highly adjustable with an \"open air design\" for proper airflow to your face to avoid overheating while also blocking outside light getting to your eyes.\n\nProject Morpheus in action\n\nAnton Mikhailov, a senior software engineer with Project Morpheus, shared his experience about the future of VR technology and its potential for gaming:\n\n\"The experience can be shared, and that's only going to allow it to spread. I think that's going to be the key. Once people see someone else interacting in VR, they're going to want to put it on and try it next.\"\n\nSome people will get a chance to see Project Morpheus in action at GDC as Sony will be demoing the headset with four new games: diving cage simulator The Deep; sci-fi dogfighter EVE: Valkyrie; medieval combat game The Castle; and a VR rendition of the stealthy action-adventure title Thief.\n\nThree years in the making\n\nShuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Worldwide Studios said that Sony was working on the technology for more than three years. Explaining the application of virtual reality in gaming, he had this to say:\n\n\"Nothing delivers a feeling of immersion better than VR. VR has been a dream of many gamers since the computer was invented. Many of us at PlayStation have dreamed of VR and what it could mean to the gaming community.\"\n\nDivulging further details about the Project Morpheus and the technology behind the VR headset, Sony Magic Lab's Richard Marks, the creator of EyeToy camera and PlayStation Move fame, had this to say:\n\n\"The thing that makes VR special is really the feeling of being in another place... there's no way to explain it to you that will make sense, but it's that feeling of presence.\n\n\"VR is going to be pervasive, and what I mean by that is it's going to be used for all sorts of things you might not think it would be used for.\" One example Marks gave was a project with NASA and its Jet Propulsion Lab that he had been working on, that will allow gamers to feel like they're on Mars.\n\nKey Development Areas for Success of Project Morpheus\n\nAccording to The Verge, Marks seems to have identified six key areas of development for the success of Project Morpheus: sight, sound, tracking, control, ease of use, and content. Sony seems to have struck the right chord with clear focus on all these areas.\n\nAs Marks reportedly explains, Sony's considerable advancement in optics and imaging technology takes care of Sight, while 3D binaural tech should help presence and immersion.\n\nPlayStation Camera and PlayStation Move should serve as tailor-made solutions for tracking and control, while Sony's revolutionary plug and play experience should promote ease of use.\n\nGames\n\nAs for the content, Sony is reportedly working with several major software partners including Epic Games, Crytek, Autodesk, Unity, and more.\n\nSony's VR project seems to be deeply inspired by the original Kickstarter-funded startup Oculus VR, whose first headset came out in 2012 and followed by an improved Oculus Rift prototype codenamed \"Crystal Cove\", which was unleashed earlier this year.\n\nCompetition in the Virtual Reality market is likely to intensify in coming years with more companies capitalising on the growing demand from gamers. Valve recently revealed plans of developing its own VR technology, while Microsoft is focusing on augmented reality glasses called \"Project Fortaleza\" which are designed to work with the Xbox One's Kinect.\n\nThough there is no word on the headset's release date, Sony is planning to release SDK for developer testing in the near future.", "397": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nSony is getting into the virtual reality business.\n\nThe Japanese electronics and gaming giant unveiled a prototype virtual reality headset to be used in conjunction with its PlayStation 4 video game console during a Tuesday talk at the Game Developers Conference.\n\nShuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, showed off the slick black-and-white headset at the annual gathering of game designers. He said Sony has been working on the technology for more than three years.\n\nThe adjustable doodad is codenamed Project Morpheus and features a head-mounted display with 1080p resolution and a 90-degree field of view. Sensors built into the headset can track a wearer's head movement in concert with a PS4 camera.\n\n\"This prototype is by no means final,\" said Yoshida. \"We will continue to work on this to improve it, but we believe it's a good representation of how PlayStation will deliver VR.\"\n\nAnton Mikhailov, a senior software engineer working on Project Morpheus, said the current version of the technology must be attached to a PS4 console with a cord that's about 15 feet long, and users' virtual perspectives can be simultaneously broadcast on a television screen.\n\n\"The experience can be shared, and that's only going to allow it to spread,\" said Mikhailov. \"I think that's going to be the key. Once people see someone else interacting in VR, they're going to want to put it on and try it next.\"\n\nMikhailov said users will be able to interact with the virtual world displayed on the headset with the gesture-detecting PlayStation Move controller, as well as the standard DualShock 4. He declined to specify when the headset would be released or how much it would cost.\n\nProject Morpheus will be available for demonstration beginning Wednesday for conference attendees on the conference's expo floor with four games: diving cage simulator \"The Deep,\" medieval combat game \"The Castle,\" sci-fi dogfighter \"EVE: Valkyrie\" and a VR rendition of the stealthy action-adventure title \"Thief.\"\n\nWhile Sony Corp. has released other head-mounted display units, Project Morpheus marks the company's first foray into VR with PlayStation. Sony's headset is similar to the Oculus Rift, a VR device currently in development by the Irvine, Calif.-based startup Oculus VR.\n\nBoth devices use head tracking to reduce queasiness when users peek around a virtual landscape, and they look more like ski googles than the bulky gaming helmets of the 1990s that usually left users with headaches.", "398": "It\u2019s been a long time coming, but Sony officially announced Project Morpheus, their virtual reality headset for the PS4, at the 2014 Game Developers Conference last night.\n\nLike the Oculus Rift, Sony\u2019s Morpheus is concerned with presence, a state where \u201cplayers feel as though they are physically inside the virtual world of a game.\u201d Unlike the relatively self-contained Rift, Morpheus is a head-mounted display that uses the PlayStation Camera to track head orientation so \u201cas the player\u2019s head rotates, the image of the virtual world rotates naturally and intuitively in real-time.\u201d The Morpheus headset can also connect with the PlayStation Move, allowing players to bring objects, such as a sword, into their virtual world and manipulate it using gesture controls.\n\nThe Morpheus headset also makes use of 3D sound to orient the player to the game world. Sony gave the example of sounds heard from above and below the player, such as \u201cfootsteps climbing up stairs below them, or engine noises of helicopters flying overhead.\u201d Sound will also reach the player differently depending upon the orientation of their head in relation to where the sound came from.\n\nIf you\u2019re attending this year\u2019s Game Developers Conference in San Franciso, you\u2019ll be able to test out the Morpheus headset at Sony Computer Entertainment\u2019s booth. Four demos will be available including a virtual reality version of Square Enix\u2019s Thief, as well as Eve: Valkyrie, a multiplayer dogfighting shooter set within CCP\u2019s Eve universe, and two tech demos: \u201cThe Castle,\u201d a Move-based medieval combat simulator, and \u201cThe Deep,\u201d which places players in a sharkproof cage.\n\nSony eventually plans to release the Morpheus headset as a commercial product, but the release date is currently unknown and Sony would only say that development is continuing.", "399": "As rumoured, Sony has unveiled an Oculus Rift-style virtual reality headset for the PS4. Named Project Morpheus, it promises to take the console to \"the next level of immersion\".\n\nLike the Oculus Rift, Project Morpheus lets you step into a virtual world of a game. It has a visor head-mounted display and works with PlayStation Camera to help create these virtual worlds.\n\nAs you move your head, the world adjusts so you see what you would if you had been plonked down in it. This headtracking is done using interial sensors.\n\nYou can also use the PlayStation Move controller as a sword in some games. Morpheus will show your hands and the sword in the virtual reality world, so you'll feel like you're actually using it to fend off foes.\n\nProject Morpheus uses 3D audio technology developed by Sony. You'll hear stereoscopic sound from all directions, including helicopters flying overhead and footsteps coming up from below. Which will add to the suspense in a game like Resident Evil.\n\nThe sounds change in real time as you move your head, too.\n\nIn terms of the tech specs, it offers a 5-inch,1,920x1,080-pixel resolution screen, that gives you a 90-degree field of view.

PlayStation Move is also being utilized for control purposes, although a DualShock 4 is going to work, too, but feels much less like a sword or gun in your hands.\n\nThere\u2019s no release window or price being spoken about at the moment. Project Morpheus is just a work in progress prototype right now, but one Sony is keen to share with developers and get in-development games supporting. At GDC there is a modified God of War game running on the unit among a number of other experimental demos including cave diving demo called The Deep, medieval combat game The Castle, CCP\u2019s Eve Valkyrie, and Eidos\u2019 Thief.\n\nWhether Morpheus ever sees a commercial release will be down to how much support it gets coupled with how cheap it is to manufacture. It is by no means a certainty just yet.", "403": "You may have heard, Virtual Reality, aka VR, is a big deal - the next big thing, in fact. Every major manufacturer and their dog is getting in on the VR game ever since the crowdfunded Oculus Rift project gained traction before being bought up by Facebook. Valve's Steam platform is all over it, Samsung has the Gear VR series, and HTC bowled everyone over with the Vive. Name a hardware firm and it has its own VR headset in the works, and recently Google made some big noises of its own with Project Daydream and the Daydream View headset.\n\nSony announced its virtual reality headset as Project Morpheus many moons ago. Morpheus has since evolved and been renamed with a commercial moniker as PlayStation VR, the headset was designed in conjunction with the PS4 and Sony also promised it would bring about \u201cthe next level of immersion\u201d to its PS4 gaming experience.\n\nHere's the official line via Sony:\n\n\u201cPlayStation\u2019s heritage has been built around innovation and ground-breaking gaming experiences, and today\u2019s reveals of new PS4 and PS VR content speaks to our continued commitment to this evolution of gaming,\u201d said Shawn Layden, President of SIEA and Chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios. \u201cFrom the reimagining of God of War to the brand new world of Days Gone, this E3 marks one of the best content line-ups in PlayStation history. With the launch of PS VR on the horizon, innovation also has never been stronger at PlayStation, as developers, from smaller independent teams to larger studios, have been able to quickly leverage the technology and create unique experiences that truly embody VR\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\nAs of October 13 2016, the PlayStation VR has been officially launched in multiple world regions, in the UK it carries an RRP price tag of \u00a3349.\n\nHow Does PlayStation VR Work?\n\nSony\u2019s VR gizmo uses a visor head-mounted display which works with the PlayStation Camera, the one you can buy alongside the PS4, and creates a virtual reality world around you.\n\nThe PlayStation VR headset does require additional hardware, though \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just run from the PS4. No, the unit will work alongside a smallish, Nintendo Wii-sized power unit that will handle all of its processing tasks.\n\nHere\u2019s what Polygon had to say about the external processing box: \u201cThe black box looked a bit smaller than a Wii and is used to process the VR graphics and sort out the second-screen social experience on the television.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThe headset itself felt refined in a way that only a company like Sony can deliver. Everything felt comfortable, futuristic, neatly designed, from the way the headset slipped onto your head and tightened with a dial built into the back of the headband, to the ability to pull the 5.7-inch OLED display away from or against your face while playing.\u201d\n\nThe 5.7-inch 1920 x1080 resolution screen offers full-HD in a 90-degree field of vision. When you move your head the world adjusts to make it look like you\u2019re looking around the virtual world. To achieve this it uses internal sensors.\n\nThe PlayStation Move controller may also have some use here as well, Sony described how it could be used as an in-game weapon such as a sword or gun. This means there will probably be a whole bunch of new accessories to accompany the headset as well.\n\nIt also uses Sony\u2019s specially developed 3D audio technology which means you\u2019ll hear stereoscopic sound from all kinds of directions. This means you can hear enemies creeping up behind you or hear sound effects from below your feet or up in the sky.\n\nBasically, if you\u2019ve got a PS4 or are thinking of getting one you will REALLY want one of these.", "404": "For the past three years a dedicated team at Sony have been working on 'Project Morpheus', a virtual reality headset that's coming to the PlayStation 4. Announced by SCE Worldwide Studio's Shuhei Yoshida at GDC 2014, the headset is still a prototype at this stage, even though the black and white design revealed on stage already looks quite slick.\n\nIn its current form, Project Morpheus packs a 5-inch, 1080p display that gives a 90 degree field of view, plus 360 degree positional head tracking powered by the PlayStation Camera. The headset will also integrate with the PlayStation Move controller, transforming into a virtual object such as a sword in select games.\n\nAs for audio, Sony claims the headset has \"true spatial sound\" through binaural audio for 3D-like effects, and there's an audio jack on the device so you can bring your own headphones. The edges of Project Morpheus will emit a subtle blue light while in operation (likely for tracking purposes), and the headset is said to be very adjustable and comfortable for prolonged gaming sessions.\n\nThe current developer kit prototype is wired, connecting to the PlayStation 4 with both HDMI and USB, although a wireless unit isn't off the cards. Sony is already working with several game developers, including Crytek and Epic Games, to develop content for Project Morpheus, but the public unveiling at GDC will hopefully entice several more to hop aboard.\n\nSony hasn't mentioned a launch timeframe for their virtual reality headset, or a targeted price, so we'll just have to wait for more information. It'll be interesting to see how the headset competes with the Oculus Rift, which is already in the hands of many developers.", "405": "Sony: the Project Morpheus VR headset\n\nThe headset, which will compete with Oculus Rift, will eventually be available for consumers to buy and is compatible with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 games console.\n\nBeyond the technology's potential in gaming, Project Morpheus will also present opportunities for brands to reach consumers in new ways, as demonstrated by O2's recent news that it would enable sports fans to don Oculus Rift headsets and virtually train with the England rugby team.\n\nSony's current prototype features 1080p resolution and a 90-degree field of view. Accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can work in conjunction with a separate PlayStation camera, track head movement and adjust the player's perspective accordingly.\n\nThe headset also features Sony\u2019s new 3D audio technology, which changes sound orientation depending on the headset wearer\u2019s position.\n\nSony stressed that Project Morpheus \u2013 more than three years in development \u2013 was far from complete and said it wants to work closely with software developers to fine-tune the technology.\n\nShu Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, said: \"The prototype for Project Morpheus is the culmination of our work over the last three-plus years as we\u2019ve refined our vision for VR. This prototype will serve as the first development kit for PS4 developers that are as enthusiastic about this new medium as we are.\"\n\nProject Morpheus was shown to delegates at GDC 2014, a global games industry event that is running over the duration of this week.", "406": "Game Developers Conference, San Francisco\u2014One of the worst-kept secrets in the games industry is now confirmed: Sony is indeed creating a games-oriented virtual reality headset for the PlayStation 4. The company announced the fruit of its labors at its \"innovation\"-themed GDC panel Tuesday evening.\n\nSony's VR system is called Project Morpheus and features a 1080p display, a 90 degree field of view, built-in audio (though there is support for external headphones), and full 360-degree head tracking. Morpheus also apparently accommodates for people who wear glasses, though I'm unsure how.\n\nSony was clear that the current version of Morpheus is strictly a prototype, seemingly indicating the headset is still a ways away from mass-market; its release date is just as nebulous as the Oculus Rift's. Will Sony follow Oculus's lead and add positional and spatial tracking to Morpheus prior to launch? Your guess is as good as mine.\n\nEVE: Valkyrie, the hotly-anticipated Oculus Rift space dogfighting launch game, will also be coming to the PS4 and Project Morpheus. Valkyrie Developer CCP has revealed its co-publishing deal with Oculus is PC-only. Sony will also be showing off a Morpheus-supported demo of Thief at GDC this week.\n\nA rendering of Project Morpheus.\n\nAfter using the Oculus Rift I had no doubt that virtual reality is the future of games, but Sony's move is a bit odd. Had the headset launched alongside the PS4 it would've made the console more expensive, perhaps negating some of Sony's edge over Microsoft's pricier Xbox One.\n\nBy launching Morpheus in the midst of a console generation, however, Sony's headset becomes an extraneous peripheral for the PlayStation 4\u2014similar to the first-generation Microsoft Kinect for the Xbox 360. And like the original Kinect, it's hard to know whether developers will embrace the tech when they can't count on anyone owning it.\n\nEven now, a year after dev kits went out, very few full-AAA games support the Oculus Rift. Most Oculus Rift \"games\" are demos or small slices of game that are built for the novelty, with exceptions like Elite: Dangerous and EVE: Valkyrie few and far between, and (more importantly) unreleased to the public at large.\n\nSony has at least been fairly open with its console, allowing indie developers to self-publish games. Perhaps they'll also be open to a flood of tech demos and novelties until full-scale titles start to arrive for the VR tech. It's still up in the air, though.\n\nWe'll get our hands on the set at GDC and compare it to the benchmark for all headsets at the moment: the Oculus Rift Crystal Cove prototype. It's impossible to really know what any of these headsets are like until we've tested them out in person. Will it make us sick? Will our eyes melt in some sort of horrific Raiders of the Lost Ark nightmare? Will it be the most incredible experience in the history of experiences?\n\nStay tuned for the answers to those questions and more later this week, once we've had time with Project Morpheus.\n\nUpdated on March 20 with a video from IDG News Service.\n\nThis story, \"Meet the Project Morpheus VR headset, the PlayStation 4's answer to Oculus Rift\" was originally published by TechHive .", "407": "While 1992\u2019s film the Lawnmower Man popularised a vision of the future in which virtual reality dominated life, the high cost of components has made the technology prohibitively expensive to date. But on Tuesday Sony Computer Entertainment announced Project Morpheus, a virtual reality headset that works with the company\u2019s PlayStation 4 video game console. The headset will fool its wearer into believing they have entered a simulated 3D world and, potentially, bring the science-fiction dreams of the 1990s to the consumer market.\n\n\n\n\u201cVirtual reality is the next innovation from PlayStation that may well shape the future of video games,\u201d said Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios at the 2014 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. \u201cVR has been the dream of many game creators ever since the first computer game. Many of us have dreamed about VR and what it could mean for the games that we create.\u201d\n\nYoshida explained the unique appeal of VR as the sense of being bodily present in a simulated environment. \u201cVR goes one step further than immersion to deliver \u2018presence\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that can only be realised by VR.\u201d\n\nRichard Marks, one of Project Morpheus\u2019s creators, described his own experience with the technology, saying: \u201cWhen I first experienced presence it shifted my scepticism into complete belief.\u201d\n\nProject Morpheus has been in development for the past three years and is still in prototype form. Sony made no mention of a launch date or price point and, as such, the product is unlikely to be the first to market. Oculus Rift, first announced in 2012 and slated for release later this year is a PC-compatible VR technology.\n\nInvented by 21-year-old Palmer Luckey, Oculus VR has raised $75m in venture funding in the past 12 months and has generated a groundswell of interest in the technology. Yoshida even paid tribute to Oculus Rift in his presentation. \u201cI have an enormous amount of respect for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were inspired in our work by the enthusiastic reactions of developers and journalists who tried their prototypes.\u201d\n\nMarks explained that VR\u2019s influence and application will soon extend far beyond the video game industry. \u201cAllowing people to experience what it\u2019s like to be somewhere else will impact many aspects of life,\u201d he said, explaining how Sony is working with Nasa to allow users to experience what it\u2019s like to stand on Mars by using real image data gathered from the Mars Rover. \u201cVR is going to be pervasive,\u201d said Marks. \u201cIt could even be used to pick out a hotel room for your next trip by visiting a virtual version of that room.\u201d", "408": "It was only a matter of time. The Oculus Rift has caught so much attention\u2014deservedly so\u2014that of course one of the big dogs was going to start honing in on its virtual reality territory. Tonight, that's Sony. And its Project Morpheus VR headset sounds fantastic.\n\nThis isn't Sony's first exploration into the world of faceputers; the wonderfully weird HMZ-T1 was a wearable television that was better than it sounds. But Project Morpheus is different. Instead of TV, it's for games. And it's got a major chance of succeeding, despite currently being just a prototype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEspecially important is that Sony's got the muscle to make Morpheus a reality; while the Oculus Rift is popular, it's also relatively niche, and has run low on components recently. If Sony sees enough interest in Morpheus, it would be able to scale up the project relatively quickly. And combined with PlayStation Move and the PlayStation Camera, it could create a potent virtual environment.\n\nSony says it's focusing on six main VR areas: sight, sound, tracking, control, easy of use, and content. Those seem like reasonable things to focus on! Although it's the content that's really going to make the biggest difference. Get developers on board with something as far-flung as Morpheus is even more important than attracting consumers. Sony's already got a handful of software partners lined up\u2014including Autodesk, Epic Games, and Unity\u2014and there will be a build of Thief from Square Enix available as a demo tomorrow, along with EVE Valkyrie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, there's not much more than generalities being tossed around in support of its efforts. Sony has a strong background on optics, which should help with sight. It has some proprietary tech to help with presence. The PlayStation Camera handles the tracking by checking your position a thousand times a second, while PS Move can help with control. And Sony says Morpheus will be a plug-and-play experience, which is easy to say when you're dealing with a prototype.\n\nSony also offered up some basic platitudes regarding its overall feelings about virtual reality; that it's a medium unto itself, that it requires its own kind of game art, that it's a social experience, that it can do more than games. It all sounds familiar, but in a good way; it would be all too typical of a megacorporation to take everything good about Oculus and turn it into something dead and stale. The dev kit even allows for mirroring the image onto a normal screen, so that multiple players can participate without needing their own headset. Sony appears to get it.\n\nThat extends to the more technical stuff too; low latency, renders that don't get fuzzy, frame rates that are worth a damn. These are the right things to focus on. It's got a 1080p display, a 90-degree field of view, and will work with people who wear glasses. Sony's clearly got its priorities in the right place\u2014as long as they actually pull it off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that speaks to big honking warning sign with Morpheus. A sleek futuristic ski mask with blue glowing lights smells distinctly of vaporware\u2014especially one that needs to be connected by a five-meter wire to the console. And even if Morpheus does come to fruition, is it a compelling enough alternative to Kinect's seamless integration into your living room life? PS4 with Morpheus funnels you ever deeper into the gaming ecosystem, while Kinect pushes out into other aspects of your life.\n\nIt's one thing to be able to create a Project Morpheus, even with every expectation of success. It's another to offer it for a price (that HMZ-T1? $800) that makes it appealing, with games and apps that people want to play and use, in a way that makes it a viable product over the long haul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage credit: Sony", "409": "Playstation 4 gets virtual reality: Sony unveils its HD Project Morpheus headset\n\nSony's adjustable head-mounted device is codenamed Project Morpheus\n\n\n\nIt features a 1080p HD resolution display and a 90-degree field of view\n\nHeadset sensors track a wearer's motion in conjunction with a PS4 camera\n\nThe head tracking has been designed to reduce queasiness\n\nPrototype must be attached to a PS4 with a 15ft (4.5 metres) long cord\n\nVirtual perspectives will be simultaneously broadcast onto a TV screen\n\nIt is available to developers, but Sony did not announce a release date\n\nThe battle of the consoles just stepped up a notch after Sony unveiled a virtual reality headset, designed especially for use with its PlayStation 4 (PS4).\n\nThe adjustable device is codenamed Project Morpheus and features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while s ensors built into the headset track head movements.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese firm unveiled the prototype device at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco but did not reveal when the product would go on sale, or how much its likely to cost.\n\n\n\nScroll Down for Video\n\n\n\nThe announcement follows rumours Sony's console rival Microsoft is similarly working on a 'suite of virtual and augmented reality' systems for its Xbox One console.\n\nMultiple sources said to be familiar with Microsoft's plans told The Wall Street Journal the firm is developing 3D virtual reality devices, and looking to file numerous patents.\n\n\n\nShuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, unveiled the black and white headset at the annual gathering of game designers.\n\n\n\nHe said Sony had been working on the technology for more than three years.\n\n'This prototype is by no means final,' said Yoshida.

Through the use of the headset, and a series of first-person cameras, the system creates the illusion that partner A can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner B, and vice versa. One member of the couple is called the user, while the other is the performer.\n\nThrough the Oculus Rift goggles, the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer's eyes. Each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner's mirror each others hand gestures, and so on, while wearing the headsets.\n\nBy mimicking movements, it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing, is actually being seen through the eyes of the user.\n\n\n\nHowever, he declined to say when the headset would be released or how much it would cost.\n\nProject Morpheus is available to developers with four games including a diving cage simulator called The Deep, medieval combat game The Castle, sci-fi dogfighter EVE: Valkyrie and a VR rendition of action-adventure title Thief.\n\nAlthough Sony has released other head-mounted display units, Project Morpheus marks the company's first foray into virtual reality with PlayStation.\n\n\n\nIt is similar to the Oculus Rift, a device currently in development by the California-based startup Oculus VR.\n\nBoth devices use head tracking to reduce queasiness when users move around a virtual landscape.", "410": "SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES\n\n\u201cPROJECT MORPHEUS\u201d \u2212 A VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEM\n\nTHAT EXPANDS THE WORLD OF PLAYSTATION\u00ae4 (PS4\u2122)\n\nWith Project Morpheus and PlayStation\u00aeCamera, Games will Immerse Players in Virtual Worlds, Delivering a Sense of Presence in Gaming Never Before Possible\n\nTokyo, March 19, 2014 \u2013Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.

A number of familiar faces returned to the place where it all began, Lima, Ohio\u2019s McKinley High, continuing with the theme of the long goodbye we\u2019re all anticipating when the show leaves its original setting and finally relocates to New York City for good.\n\nBut before that can happen, there\u2019s one last assignment for New Directions: Take a song they\u2019ve performed in the past and give it an overhaul while the gang\u2019s all here.\n\nMercedes (Amber Riley) and Rachel (Lea Michele) are the first to face off in a return to visit McKinley. The old competitive spirit is clearly alive and kicking between the two divas. Another return guest of the show, April Rose, (Kristen Chenoweth), pops by and brags about owning her own island and generally being a kept woman. She\u2019s arrived to to toast the glee club with a rendition of Pink\u2018s \u201cRaise Your Glass.\u201d Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is feeling jazzy in his plaid vest.\n\nIn his inner monologue, Air Force soldier Puck (Mark Salling) notes how much he has changed since leaving high school. That is, until he runs face to face with Quinn (Dianna Agron). They flirt and chat about the song they plan to sing but are interrupted when Quinn\u2019s boyfriend, Biff McIntosh (played by Chace Crawford) playfully pinches Quinn on the rear. The two guys size each other up. Biff is very upper crust, old money, prep school. Puck is, well, Puck.\n\nFormer flames Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) reunite for a somewhat romantic rendez-vous. Brittany laments the monotony of her life as a professional mathematical genius. This prompts a reunion of The Unholy Trinity, Brittany, Santana and Quinn, for a performance of Britney Spears\u2018 \u201cToxic,\u201d alternating between cheerleader outfits and Pussycat Doll-style costumes. Biff can\u2019t stop text messaging on his phone long enough to see his girlfriend slutting it up.\n\nThis leads to Brittany hosting an episode of her show Fondue For Two with Mercedes and Rachel as guests. She barrages the two ladies with surprisingly hard-hitting questions and they reveal that they both plan to sing \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d from Wicked. There is to be yet another a diva-off! Even better: Brittany\u2019s cats make out on camera. God, how we missed Fondue For Two.\n\nBiff and Quinn enjoy a meal at Breadstix when he spots Santana, Puck, Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Artie (Kevin McHale) and asks them to join them at their booth to dig dirt on Quinn. When the skeletons start to fly out of the closet, Quinn sends Biff to retrieve her purse from the car. She admits to the old gang that she hasn\u2019t told Biff about Beth, the baby girl she and Puck gave up for adoption. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s not going to let Biff know the real Quinn.\n\nApril Rose and Will meet with Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) in an attempt to save the glee club with one final effort. Shortly thereafter, Rachel, Mercedes and Kurt (Chris Colfer) duke it out as they sing \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d The results of the diva-off won\u2019t be revealed until the following day.\n\nSantana interrupts Brittany playing human chess with the chess club in costumes for another chat to encourage Brittany to pick up dancing again because it\u2019s her passion. Alternately, Rachel and Mercedes campaign for the title of the biggest star to emerge from glee club (not a real title).\n\nSantana interrupts Puck\u2019s performance with a surprise dance duet with Brittany. Speaking of interventions, I\u2019m a little concerned that Santana\u2019s wasting away to nothing. They perform the Amy Winehouse version of \u201cValerie\u201d After some coaxing from Santana and Mike, Brittany joins her.\n\nPuck has the group move to the auditorium for his rendition of Avril Lavigne\u2018s \u201cKeep Holding On,\u201d directed pretty obviously toward Quinn, just as Finn (Cory Monteith) and the original cast sang it to her in the first season. It literally has her clutching her pearls and brings her to tears.\n\nThe diva-off final vote count is interrupted by Santana giving a mean speech about Rachel that rips her to shreds. They bicker over the Funny Girl role before Rachel storms off. Mercedes follows her to find Rachel crying in the bathroom, where she laments that she still feels like she\u2019s back in high school. (Well, of course, she is back in high school\u2026) Mercedes tells Rachel that she uses the negativity to fuel her passion. They bond and hug.\n\nSue meets again with Will and April Rose and apparently, the money for glee club ran out six weeks ago after being used up by Will for all the over the top productions he\u2019s been staging. Ha! As it turns out, April Rose is under indictment after her relationship with Bernie Madoff. April admits she\u2019s a pathological liar who can\u2019t be trusted and Will is devastated.\n\nPuck catches Biff reacting to Quinn telling him about her tattoo and her baby. After Biff calls her a \u201cdirty little slut bag,\u201d Quinn pinches his nose and a fight breaks out between Biff and Puck. It ends with prep school boy in the dumpster.\n\nThe votes collected in the music room are about to reveal the results of the diva-off when Mercedes and Rachel announce that they don\u2019t care who won. Well, that\u2019s good for them, because they both tied with equal votes.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow returns as Holly Holliday and gives her muzak version of \u201cHappy\u201d by Pharrell Williams. Soul is overrated, y\u2019all.\n\nPuck visits Finn\u2019s framed jersey and is joined by Quinn. Biff is going back to Yale without her. Puck calls Quinn his soulmate before walking away from her. Meanwhile, Brittany makes a play for Santana, who is hesitant to revisit their relationship. As Puck strides through the halls, Quinn runs after him and they kiss triumphantly for one last shot at love.\n\nAll gather in the auditorium to continue to say their goodbyes. Will breaks down with Holly and April watching from the rafters, and the two women plot to somehow save the club with only a few short episodes left. Will they make it happen?\n\nGet an eyeful of even more pop music coverage, from artist interviews to exclusive performances, on Idolator\u2019s YouTube channel.", "414": "Glee stars Lea Michele and Dianna Agron were among cast members celebrating the show's 100th episode at a party in Los Angeles on Tuesday (18Mar14) night.\n\nActors including Naya Rivera, Amber Riley and Jane Lynch headed to a bash at the city's Chateau Marmont hotel to celebrate the landmark while the episode aired across the U.S.\n\nThe cast and crew gathered inside the venue to toast the achievement and give speeches reminiscing about their early memories of the show, which began in 2008.\n\nMichele wrote in a post on Twitter.com, \"Can't wait for tonight's 100th episode of Glee! I'm so proud to be part of such an amazing show that brings me such joy every single day.\"\n\nShe then posted a number of nostalgic pictures including her first day playing character Rachel and another showing her hugging late co-star Cory Monteith underneath a Glee billboard in 2009.\n\nAgron also tweeted, \"I can remember the first day like it was yesterday.

The songs were good though, so we\u2019ll let them off the hook.\n\n\n\nThe battle of the divas... has been going on since season 1.\n\nThey had to be good. Not only was this the 100th episode of the Fox show, it was also a chance to pay Finn Hudson (and, by extension, Cory Monteith) one final farewell, it mostly consisted of the cast revisiting old favorites. Two things should come to mind when you read that \u2013 Brittany\u2019s Britney Spears hallucination extravaganza and, of course, the one and only, that age-old Glee favorite \u2013 Defying Gravity. Both were revisited in the very first fifteen minutes, of course. The Britney act was a sort of Tango-meets-Toxic-meets-burlesque mashup performed by the Unholy Trinity \u2013 Britney, Santana and a holier-than-thou Quinn, relishing the chance to get back to her misfit roots. Cool. Great. Seen it before.\n\n\n\nThe best part of the Britney act? Naya Rivera.\n\nThe defying Gravity bit brought up some major deja vu feelings, as Rachel, Mercedes and, for some reason, Kurt, once again battled it out for the title of Top Diva. One has a recording contract and the other \u2013 a role on Broadway, but it doesn\u2019t matter of course, because any personal growth will always be abandoned for a chance at some nostalgia. The episode also saw a return of some of our favorite guest stars \u2013 or the ones they could get to come back anyway, aka Miss Holiday (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Kristin Chenoweth as the boozy Broadway hopeful April Rhodes. They belted out some hits, stood by awkwardly during the more personal moments and then (major spoiler alert) decided to save the New Directions from Sue Sylvester\u2019s clutches! What!? Quinn has a new boyfriend (or had, since he was dealt with by the end of the episode), while Santana and Brittany (now apparently a math genius) are rekindling some lost feelings for eachother. Everyone else is just sort of... there. And that was your 100th anniversary episode.

(Adam Rose/FOX)\n\nFox\u2019s \u201cGlee\u201d burst onto the scene in 2009; five years later, it barely made a blip on the pop culture radar as it celebrated its 100th episode. Perhaps sensing it\u2019s not the groundbreaking force it used to be back in the day when it spawned an era of singing shows, the writers wisely took the opportunity to gaze back into the past at the glory days.\n\nThe network let viewers vote on songs from past seasons that they wanted to hear reinvented on Tuesday night\u2019s 100th episode. Unsurprisingly, they\u2019re all tunes from the show\u2019s early days, when the storylines were at \u201cslightly improbable\u201d instead of \u201ccompletely nonsensical.\u201d The show managed to round up all the old cast members, even if they\u2019ve moved on in real life: Rachel (Lea Michele); Mercedes (Amber Riley); Quinn (Dianna Agron); Brittany (Heather Morris); Santana (Naya Rivera); Puck (Mark Salling); Artie (Kevin McHale); Kurt (Chris Colfer); Blaine (Darren Criss); Becky (Lauren Potter) and Mike (Harry Shum Jr.).\n\nAnd, of course, the grown-ups, including Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and special former guest stars April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth) and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow). There was just a brief mention of Finn (Cory Monteith, who died last summer at age 31), as the characters remembered their friend.\n\nMostly, the plot centered around the fact that the glee club will finally be shutting down, thanks to the evil Sue Sylvester. Hmm \u2026 where have we heard that one before? In almost every single episode in the first two seasons? Anyway, since plot was never \u201cGlee\u2019s\u201d strong suit, here\u2019s every song they sang during the milestone episode (and video), and where it was originally heard in \u201cGlee\u201d lore.\n\n\u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d (Pink) Video here\n\nOriginally performed: Season 2, Episode 16 (March 15, 2011) by the Warblers, the rival singing group\n\nExcuse for bringing it back: Will Schuester, always a man with a plan, thinks former glee club star April Rhodes miiiight be able to save the club \u2014 in any case, she arrives in the chorus room to sing a rousing rendition of the Pink hit to get everybody pumped up.\n\nBetter version: The remake. The adults looked adorably lame singing this one, with everyone\u2019s glasses in the air: It had a certain spark that the Warblers lacked.\n\n\u201cToxic\u201d (Britney Spears) Video here\n\nOriginally performed: Season 2, Episode 2 (September 28, 2010) by the glee club and Mr. Schuester\n\nExcuse for bringing it back: Former cool crowd members Santana, Brittany, Quinn reunite the old trio for a creepy version of this song, half the time in their old McKinley High cheerleading uniforms and half the time in burlesque-type outfits.\n\nBetter version: The original. That was the Britney Spears-centric episode, where Mr. Schue tries to look cool and join the kids on stage during a school assembly. As strange as that was, the real Britney made a cameo in the episode. That can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\n\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d (\u201cWicked\u201d soundtrack) Video here\n\nOriginally performed: Season 1, Episode 9 (November 11, 2009) by Rachel and Kurt\n\nExcuse for bringing it back: The first time around, Rachel and Kurt both auditioned to sing the song, known as a \u201cdiva off,\u201d to decide who would get the solo. Kurt protested it shouldn\u2019t automatically just go to Rachel because it\u2019s a song traditionally performed by a woman; however, he ended up messing up the final high note. This time, Mercedes and Rachel are feuding about who is more successful post-high school \u2014 so they both belt this out (with some help from Kurt) so the glee club can vote on who is best. It\u2019s very mature.\n\nBetter version: The original. Stakes were so much higher back then, and it was an actual emotional moment when Kurt made the mistake.\n\n\u201cValerie\u201d (The Zutons/Amy Winehouse) Video here\n\nOriginal song: Season 2, Episode 9 (November 30, 2010) by Santana and the whole glee club\n\nExcuse for bringing it back: After leaving high school, Brittany is apparently a lab rat at MIT where the scientists marvel at the weird way her brain works (remember, she famously said that dolphins are just gay sharks). She is also apparently a math genius. This makes her understandably sad, so Santana stages a remake of their old dance-centric song to cheer her up.\n\nBetter version: The remake. Such better dancing!\n\n\u201cKeep Holding On\u201d (Avril Lavigne) Video here\n\nOriginal song: Season 1, Episode 7 (October 14, 2009) by Finn, Rachel and the glee club\n\nExcuse for bringing it back: Puck takes this on as an acoustic solo to woo back Quinn, his former love interest (and mother of his child) who is now dating a snobby rich guy named Biff McIntosh (Chace Crawford). Biff is amazing and Crawford shows off some surprisingly solid comedic chops \u2014 where was that talent on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d? Anyway, Puck tries to win back Quinn (and ultimately succeeds) with a song that the glee club sang to her back in the day for support when she got pregnant.\n\nBetter version: The original. It\u2019s truly haunting after Monteith\u2019s death.\n\nBONUS:\n\n\u201cHappy\u201d (Gwyneth Paltrow)\n\nReprising her role as striving-to-be-cool Spanish teacher Holly Holliday, Paltrow showed up because why not? In the cliffhanger, she was apparently plotting with April Rhodes about how to save the glee club.

But I don\u2019t really hate nostalgia \u2013 not only would that be weird, but I would probably have to get off Tumblr altogether. I\u2019m just weary of it; like your grandmother watching you use your iPhone\u2026actually, maybe that\u2019s that opposite of nostalgia, but you get it. Weary.\n\nNostalgia isn\u2019t just remembering the past, it\u2019s remembering the past more fondly than you\u2019re experiencing the present. Because when a bus splashes you with three-month-old snow on your walk to work (seriously, New York, it\u2019s late March, I did not sign up for this), you\u2019re not exactly looking at the present situation through rose-colored glasses. But when you\u2019re looking back on college, or high school, or that time you had a bunch of Britney Spears hallucinations, it\u2019s easy to just remember the good stuff.\n\nI think I\u2019m future-focused Quinn in this long winded scenario \u2014 Puckerman is a Buzzfeed list about how everyone wore capri pants in 2003. And maybe Puck is right this time, that it\u2019s OK to dwell a little in the past (especially if it\u2019s going to result in Mercedes, Kurt and Rachel revisiting \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d) because this 100th episode was a pretty fun ride. It has most of the mainstays of 2.0 and Original Flavor Glee. It pokes a little fun at itself, and still lacks plenty of self-awareness; it made me laugh, and, ugh, it made me cry; I was simultaneously frustrated by and disgustingly fond of almost every single character. Yes, somehow it\u2019s taken this long for confusing, silly, weird little Glee to reach its 100th episode. Bring on the nostalgia, I\u2019m totally ready!\n\nWhen the camera first flashes to Mercedes and Rachel storming down the McKinley halls \u2013 Mercedes sashaying, and Rachel with her baby stomps \u2013 I almost can\u2019t remember a time when they weren\u2019t there. Of course, we won\u2019t soon forget the era of \u201cWhat Does the Fox Say\u201d or \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d but for one brief moment, it\u2019s a near thing. Technically they\u2019re here to celebrate the Glee Club one last time before it\u2019s gone forever; but in reality they\u2019re back to prove something they wanted so badly to prove in high school, and it seems that no amount of unimaginable success at 19 years of age is able to do it for them. (See, this is why I\u2019m nostalgia-weary\u2026I am not trying to go back to my Texas high school to prove a point.) They\u2019re don\u2019t quite receive the hero\u2019s welcome they were expecting as \u201cthe biggest Broadway star/recording artist this school has ever produced,\u201d though, and it\u2019s got them a little sour.\n\nIn addition to the two shiniest Glee divas, the rest of the gang has also made the trip back to Lima: Brittany, Santana, Mike Chang and Quinn are all back, and still willing to listen to Will, who tells them their assignment this week is to reinvent songs they\u2019ve sung in the past. Speaking of revisiting the past, April Rhodes is back! She\u2019s acquired herself an island, a pixie cut and just a hint of extra Blanche DuBois to her accent. Tina tells Marley that April \u201ctaught [her] how to shoplift meat in [her] vagina,\u201d and I\u2019m reminded that, yes, that sure is something she did. But today is less about vagina thievery, and more about celebrating, so it\u2019s time to revise former Warblers number, \u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d (with only two episodes left, I knew it was about 50/50 that I would have to hear Will say \u201cpanty snatcher,\u201d so at least I was semi-prepared). It doesn\u2019t quite hit the original Warblers high, but of course it\u2019s a party because there are just SO MANY PEOPLE. The kids, new and old, and their chaperones dance the only way you can to that song: jump, jump, fist pump, fist pump, break into trios indicative of your dance skill level.

From this borderline X-rated performance, the love life of Quinn, with pretentious beau Biff Macintosh (Chace Crawford), becomes the focus with her dreams of marrying into wealth. This, of course, is thwarted by her feelings and history with \u201csaw\u201d-turned-airmen Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling).\n\n\n\nWith Quinn on the mind, Puckerman sings a remake of season one\u2019s \u201cKeep Holding On\u201d by Avril Lavigne performed by the Glee Club. This reminds Quinn of the couple's complicated past and her difficult time dealing with her unexpected pregnancy. Deciding to completely come clean about her high school past backfires and her dreams of becoming Quinn Macintosh are over. More conflict ensues, but after a locker-room reconnection and romantic hall kiss, Quinn and Puck are back on.\n\nIn another love connection, Santana Lopez and Brittany S. Pierce\u2019s lives are highlighted. Brittany, completely enthralled with her mathematical genius, has forgotten about her dance roots. Santana makes it her mission to revive Brittany's passion for dance, re-covering season two\u2019s performance of Amy Winehouse's \"Valerie.\"\n\n\n\nAfter watching one of Glee club\u2019s best dancers, Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.), during this performance, Brittany is back. Interestingly, along with the return of her passion for dance, come her feelings for Santana. Initially, Santana is seemingly not a fan of the rekindled love connection, but Brittany is. After sharing a kiss, Brittany professes her love for Santana and puts the decision about their relationship in Santana's hands.\n\nAll the while, Rachel and Mercedes are locked in a battle for \u201cBest Diva\u201d of the Glee Club. They do a sing-off to season one\u2019s cover of \"Wicked\u2019s\" \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d performed by Rachel and Kurt, hoping to gain the most votes for the unnecessary title. Before voting, Santana reverts back to her days as a Cheerio and completely slams Rachel embarrassing her in front of the Glee Club. Seriously, it was painful to watch.\n\nIn her usual uplifting, comforting way, Mercedes encourages Rachel and the two decide not to participate in the competition. However, the ballots have been counted and are, unsurprisingly, equal.\n\nThe Glee Club also welcomed back substitute teacher, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) singing Pharrell Williams\u2019 \u201cHappy\u201d; and with the help of April, they leave us with their intention to work on a plan to save the Glee Club.\n\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the two eccentric ladies decide.\n\nPerformance of the night- Santana and Brittany\u2019s cover of Amy Winehouse\u2019s \u201cValerie\u201d\n\nAnd that is what you missed on this week\u2019s episode of \u201cGlee.\u201d", "419": "This week\u2019s episode of \u201cGlee\u201d is all about the numbers: It\u2019s the series\u2019 100th episode, a half-dozen cast members and guest stars who aren\u2019t gracing the (surprisingly well-kept) plastic chairs of the McKinley High School, and New Directions is in trouble over the number of dollars of school funding (zero) it has left.

Poor Kurt, who also sings the song, is fully ignored in the ensuing vote, where Rachel and Mercedes are dubbed to be equally divatastic.\n\nSantana \u2013 \u201cValerie\u201d\n\nAfter Math Genius Brittany admits that she misses high school, when \u201call I wanted to do was scissor you and talk to my cat,\u201d Santana decides it\u2019s time to dance.\n\nPuck \u2013 \u201cKeep Holding On\u201d\n\nPuck makes everyone walk to the auditorium, apparently while inaudibly muttering to himself, \u201coh, she\u2019s so totally gonna cry\u201d and pulls out this Season One classic, originally directed at Quinn to let her know that everyone\u2019s still super into her even though she\u2019s going to be a teen mom. This time, Puck wants it to mean that he\u2019s still super into her even though she\u2019s dating a guy named Biff and totally denying that she was a teen mom. There\u2019s always a sticking point, isn\u2019t there? Cue waterworks.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow \u2013 \u201cHappy\u201d\n\nBecause it\u2019s never not a good time for some GOOP lovin\u2019, we\u2019re gifted with the presence of Gwyneth Paltrow herself. (Her character has a name, and it\u2019s Holly, but let\u2019s be real and call a Gwynnie a Gwynnie. We\u2019re Shakespeare, and we\u2019re so in love.) She delivers the all-time classic line of, \u201cApril, thank you for buttering the floor for me, you know I love to make an entrance\u201d before leading the club in a lil jam sesh.\n\nSee you next Tuesday, which we assume will be a real emotional journey for the characters. (Get it, because they held off singing \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin'\u201d for an entire episode? Journey. Yeah.)", "420": "If you have been watching \u201cGlee\u201d since its premiere in 2009, you have, despite the inconsistent writing in its later years, fallen in love with the characters and the musical numbers, shed a tear over one of the heartwarming speeches given by Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison), or learned a lesson about life from one of the many real-life issues tackled by the show. These are reasons why its 100th episode, which focuses on the dismembering of the Glee club, marks the end of an era, as the rest of the series will no longer focus on McKinley\u2019s students, but some of the graduates finding their way in New York City.\n\nThe episode, appropriately titled \u201c100,\u201d begins with the rumblings of a revived rivalry between McKinley High\u2019s resident divas, Rachel (Lea Michele) and Mercedes (Amber Riley). After they appear on Brittany\u2019s (Heather Morris) talk show Fondue For Two, they decide to settle who is the better performer with a diva-off, set to none other than \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d by the cast of \u201cWicked.\u201d The ladies perform the song, alongside Kurt (Chris Colfer), and await the announcement of the winner, by vote of the Glee club.\n\nMr. Schuester delivers his final assignment \u2013 to reinvent songs they have previously sung to celebrate one hundred lessons. To start the celebration off, the New Directions sing \u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d by P!nk (which was never actually sung by the New Directions, but by Blaine (Darren Criss) and the Warblers), with the help of everyone\u2019s favorite energetic (and alcoholic) blonde, April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth).\n\nQuinn (Dianna Agron) has returned to Lima with her Yale boyfriend, Biff (played by guest star Chace Crawford) much to the dismay of a newly-confident, uniformed Puck (Mark Salling). Puck finds out that Quinn has yet to tell Biff about her former life as a pregnant, teen cheerleader, or that she had a goth phase. (Who can forget that Ryan Seacrest tattoo?!)\n\nSantana (Naya Rivera) realizes Brittany is stressed from her school work at MIT and that she hasn\u2019t been dancing. To get her back to her old self, Santana reunites the Unholy Trinity to a new version of \u201cToxic\u201d by Britney Spears. This does little to boost Brittany\u2019s confidence, so Santana tries to find a new way to help her former girlfriend.\n\nQuinn and Biff are enjoying a meal at the infamous Breadstix, where they run into Puck, Santana, Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Artie (Kevin McHale). When Biff doesn\u2019t react too kindly to the reveal of Quinn\u2019s goth phase, she sends him to retrieve her purse from the car, and scolds her former teammates for tainting her image. Oh, that Quinn and her secrets!\n\nThe Glee club gets a glimmer of hope when Will and April bring her ownership of the auditorium to Sue\u2019s (Jane Lynch) attention, meaning that she decides who can and cannot sing there. The excitement doesn\u2019t last long, as it is later revealed that April is broke and can no longer afford to own the auditorium. Will voices his disappointment with April, leaving her embarrassed, but eager to find another way to help the Glee club remain intact.\n\n\n\nSantana tries once more to help Brittany by performing a duet to an old favorite, \u201cValerie\u201d by The Zutons. She finally gets Brittany to dance without over thinking it and this brings the former couple closer together.\n\nPuck asks the Glee club to reconvene in the auditorium for a special performance of \u201cKeep Holding On\u201d by Avril Lavigne, which was once performed by the Glee club to show their support for Quinn during her pregnancy. This turns into a very emotional moment for Quinn, but in typical fashion, she pushes Puck away and declares her love for Biff.\n\nThe time has come for the members of New Directions to reveal their votes for the diva-off, but before a winner is announced, Santana delivers Rachel a verbal smack down, which sends her crying in the bathroom. Mercedes finds her and they make up, keeping a friendly competition between them alive.\n\nPuck walks in on an argument between Quinn and Biff after she reveals her past to him. Biff\u2019s reaction is less than what she expected, and warrants a punch in the face and a toss in the dumpster from Puck, who knows that Quinn is much better than the Yale degenerate.\n\nApril makes up for her indiscretion by bringing back McKinley\u2019s favorite substitute teacher, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), who knows April through the Facebook page dedicated to guests of the Glee club. The celebration continues with Holly singing \u201cHappy\u201d by Pharrell Williams along with New Directions.\n\nMeanwhile, Quinn finds Puck in the locker room, gazing at Finn\u2019s (Cory Monteith) jersey, where Puck finally tells Quinn exactly how he feels \u2013 he loves her and she\u2019s his soulmate but she pushes him away once again. Moments later, she has a realization. The audience share a collective \u201csquee!\u201d as Quinn runs through the school\u2019s hallway to make her way to Puck. They kiss and it\u2019s magical. Finally. Quinn and Puck\u2019s reunion has been a longtime coming.\n\nBrittany finally starts feeling like her old self again and realizes it\u2019s all thanks to Santana, she thanks her with a kiss but Santana isn\u2019t so eager to reunite with her former girlfriend, who she has spent months trying to get over. Not to mention her girlfriend back in New York, Dani (Demi Lovato) but Brittany doesn\u2019t care. She knows now, more than ever, that they belong together, but she leaves the choice up to Santana.\n\nMr. Schuester gathers the original New Directions in the auditorium for one last pep talk. As they stare up at Finn\u2019s newly located plaque, they realize that the Glee club, as wonderful as it was, is gone.\n\nHolly and April, meanwhile, decide help the Glee club once and for all, once they finish their wine. Will they succeed?\n\nTags : Amber Riley, chris colfer, darren criss, dianna agron, Glee, glee recap, gwyneth paltrow, Harry Shum Jr., heather morris, Kevin McHale, Kristin Chenoweth, lea michele, Mark Salling, Matthew Morrison, Naya Rivera", "421": "How does one measure a hundred episodes of Glee? In group numbers, in Blaine's hair gel, in Fondue for Two, in diva-offs, in mash-ups, and oh so much more. Tonight marks the 100th episode of Glee and with some familiar faces and some remixed Glee classics - this episode is sure to mark the next dynasty in Glee. Here's to the New Directions old and new, and to Glee!\n\nMercedes and Rachel return to McKinley to say goodbye to the legacy of glee club, and each is acting like the diva they are - apparently nothing has changed. Will is set to celebrate 100 lessons of glee club with remixed classics from the past, and what better way to that then with some help from April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth). April is up to her usual boozy ways, and what better way to raise a glass to New Directions than with a little \"Raise Your Glass\", which Blaine is quick to point out was in fact a Warblers number, but what would a New Direction be without a good Warbler?\n\nPuck reflects back on being the Puckzilla of the past, while moving forward to be the brand new Puckerman, but one can never forget their first love, right? Puck attempts to get Quinn in on his glee club tribute, but gets interrupted by Quinn's new man, Biff Macintosh (Chace Crawford). Puckzilla don't take no for an answer, so watch out, Apple Tree. Santana finds Brittany getting her math on, while lamenting how she misses her life back at McKinley, and who is Santana to deny her former lady a good time? Santana gathers the Unholy Trinity to get a little \"Toxic\" and steam up the choir room one last time. #UnholyTrinityForever.\n\nWhen April asks Biff for his opinion on the number, but it becomes clear that Biff wasn't even paying attention. Brittany feels like she's lacking in her dancing skills, despite Santana assuring her she's still as fierce as always. Brittany decides to focus on her math and her hit online talk show - Fondue for Two. Brittany has Mercedes and Rachel on, and grills them for hot dish, which ends in both admitting they plan to sing \"Defying Gravity\" as a tribute to glee club. When the diva gauntlet is thrown, the two dueling divas decide to settle this in typical glee club diva style - a diva-off. Hell to the yes, y'all!\n\nBiff and Quinn get cozy at Breadstixs, but the New Directions arrive and begin to rehash the past, which is something Quinn refuses to let the past get in the way of old money. April and Will try to play hardball with Sue on the money that keeps the auditorium up to snuff, but Sue isn't going down without a fight. One final diva off is only appropriate and thus the dueling divas along with Kurt channel their inner green girl and belt out \"Defying Gravity\" one last time - winner take all diva-off. Before a diva can be chosen, Will interrupts and decides to hold off choosing, because everyone's a winner or something. Typical, Schuester, so typical.\n\nBrittany seems lost in math and chess games, but Santana is determined to bring the old Brittany back, despite Brittany insisting that this is who she is now. Mercedes and Rachel plead their case to the New Directions to garner the votes for true diva, while April gives her usual boozy wisdom to Kurt and Blaine. Santana hijacks the glee club floor from Puck and busts out a little \"Valerie\" to get Brittany back in the groove with a little assistance from Magic Mike Chang himself. ..And this ladies and gents is how Brittany got her groove back - with a little Amy Winehouse and Santana. Deciding to change the scenery a little, Puck moves the glee club to the auditorium and sings \"Just Keep Holding On\" to the girl who seemed to have gotten away - Quinn. With help from the New Directions, Puck pulls at Quinn's heartstrings. Puck attempts to get Quinn to remember her past, but Quinn is determined to put the past behind her and keep moving forward. The time has come for the true diva, but Santana unleashes some truth about the one and only Rachel Berry, which prompts one last Rachel storm out. Mercedes goes to comfort Rachel and they realize that they use the people who use to put them down to get them forward, and how two dueling divas have never been so different. Sue pulls the wool out from under April and reveals that the money she set aside for the auditorium ran out and that she is flat broke. Will upset with April leaves, but not before telling April how upset he is that she took the remaining hope he had left that glee club wasn't finished.\n\nQuinn reveals the past to Biff, who freaks out about hearing how Quinn is a liar and nothing like she pretended to be. Puck and Biff throw down, and Biff ends up in the dumpster. The glee club votes for the all time diva, but Mercedes and Rachel renter to explain there's no need for the vote - divas can do bad all by themselves. April brings in another familiar face from the past to celebrate - Holly Holiday herself, who reveals that there's a guests of glee club Facebook group, and that she's started a pop up substitute service. In usual Holly Holiday style, Holly does her own thing, and rather than look back - she brings a little Pharrell's \"Happy\" to the glee club floor.\n\nPuck and Quinn and Brittany and Santana feel the sparks of old love begin to fly, but are they ready to let the flame reignite? Santana pulls away from what her heart wants, but Quinn gives in and follows her heart straight to Puck. The original members of the glee club share a moment together, as April and Holly watch on and plot to save the glee club - for realz.\n\nWill the boozy blondes save glee club? The battle to save it is on, as the remixed classics and nostalgia continue just in time for the seniors to prepare to say goodbye and graduate from McKinley. Until next week, Gleeks - keep the faith and a song in your heart.\n\nRelated Articles", "422": "The 100th episode of FOX\u2019s Glee airs tonight (March 18), complete with a whole lot of returning faces.

So while we wait for the Season 4 release date to near, let\u2019s check out the latest batch of news regarding the latest \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d installment. HBO released the first four episode titles, which The Season 4 premiere episode which debuts in a mere 20 days is titled \u201cTwo Swords,\u201d it will have a run time of 58 minutes. Following the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere episode, Season 4 will continue on April 13 with episode 2, \u201cThe Lion and the Rose,\u201d which has a run time of 52 minutes. Following episode 2 will be \u201cBreaker of Chains\u201d episode 3, which runs for 4 minutes longer than its predecessor, and finally episode 4 \u201cOathkeeper\u201d will premiere on April 27th and run for 54 minutes. New reports claim that the fifth episode title has been revealed and like the others this season, it is specific referring to a well-known character. The title of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 4 episode 5 is \u201cFirst Of His Name,\u201d which has a run time of 54 minutes.\n\nWarning spoilers for Season 4 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ahead. Do not read any further if you do not want to know what will happen in the fifth episode of the forthcoming season.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the phrase \u201cFirst of His Name,\u201d you need to watch more of this series. But for those loyal fans who have heard it before, it can be said in reference to multiple males on the show. The phrase is a part of a royal\u2019s title, a King of Westeros, to be more specific, that has a different name from any other King who has sat on the Iron Throne before him. Fans first heard this moniker when King Robert Baratheon was announced, and it has continued into Season 3 of the series with none other than his \u201cson\u201d King Joffrey Baratheron. The formula is simply really, the King is formally addressed by his subjects as \"Your Grace\" and in official events referred to his full name which is normally announced by the Royal Steward, \u201cAll hail His Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.\"\n\nBut if Joffrey is already first of his name and has been for three seasons, why is this so important that episode 5 is named after it. Most likely because there is a new king in town, the title is most likely referring to Joff\u2019s younger brother Tommen. Tommen Baratheon will take the throne after his elder brother\u2019s death which will occur at his wedding feats in episode 2 \u201cThe Lion and the Rose.\u201d Much like the \u201cRed Wedding\u201d the wedding of Joffrey and Margarey will be witness to death, however this time the Lannisters are the victims, more specifically Joffrey. The young King is enjoying his wedding feast next to his new bride, when he begins to choke. At first the court is stunned by the King\u2019s choking, thinking that he simply ate too much pie, but they soon to begin to realize the seriousness of the situation. While clawing at his own throat in a desperate attempt to breathe, Joffrey points to his uncle Tyrion in his last moments seemingly indicating his guilt in his apparent poisoning. Tyrion empties the remainder of Joffrey\u2019s chalice on the floor of the Red Keep and then begins to leave, although Cersei distraught and enraged orders the arrest of both Tyrion and his wife Sansa after confirming the death of her eldest son. Following this event, we are assuming based of the episode title, that Tommen\u2019s coronation will take place in episode 5, \u201cFirst Of His Name.\u201d", "424": "Dave Brockie died last Sunday, March 23, in his Richmond, VA home.

Detectives do not suspect foul play at this time and the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office will determine cause of death.\"\n\nThe band, as of 8:15 a.m. Monday, had not issued a statement about the police report.\n\nGwar's last performance in Detroit was Nov. 8, 2013 and MLive.com was there to capture it all.\n\nCheck out my interview with Brockie in the video player above.\n\nWARNING: There's some adult language.\n\nBrockie and his bandmates certainly have performed some memorable shows over the years at Harpos.\n\nThe website setlist.fm says Gwar, formed in 1984 in Richmond, Va., has performed 682 shows around the world and 544 in the U.S.\n\nDuring the band's last show in Detroit, Brockie reflected on the band's longevity in a colorful way that took a shot at the Detroit Lions' lack of success.\n\n\"How about we hear it for kicking your ass for the last 28 years here!,\" Brockie screamed on stage. \"The Detroit Lions sure aren't gonna do it. They suck!\"\n\nBrockie's reaction when I asked him what he likes about playing at Harpos: \"Nothing!\"\n\nBrockie added in the interview that he loves playing at Detroit venues because he didn't feel like places like Harpos had any rules.\n\nAs the Oderus Urungus character, he clearly had his way with the Harpos crowd during a show that included a fake human sacrifice of \"Justin Bieber\" and plenty of fake blood sprayed at fans.\n\n\"Life will kill you!,\" Brockie yelled on stage. \"And until you die, you will be subject to meaningless torture!\"", "427": "\"It's not really a message,\" the band members told Jerry Springer on his daytime talk show. \"It's more like a massage.\"\n\nOn stage, GWAR have always been something to behold: less a band than a mutating, oozing, phallus-laden Cronenberg blob of Fuck You. Offstage, though, was where GWAR, and spokesmonster Brockie in particular, made its mark as a bastion of trolling. Throughout GWAR's 30-plus years of existence, the Ottawa-born Brockie made more headlines as a talking head (or talking melted alien skull thing) than his songs ever did, whether by baiting the hosts on Fox News or accusing fellow shock acts Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson of \"hanging out with their director buddies as they throw gala award ceremonies to circle jerk each other into a frenzy.\" Regular guests on daytime talk shows, they were the poster boys for the deranged society scorned by Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center. GWAR provoked people for entertainment, like some kind of live-action Youtube commenters wearing rubber masks.\n\nThis philosophy defied heavy-metal culture, known for taking itself way too seriously. In recent years, it also defied mainstream culture's attempts to intellectualize and pacify metal in the popular consciousness. (Hello, Sasha Frere-Jones!) While there's nothing wrong with bringing extreme music into the tent, many of its diehards will always love this music precisely because it\u2019s for freaks and outsiders\u2014a fact that GWAR made literal. What was so amazing about Dave Brockie was that he never lost the ability to shock, and he did it not by burning churches or carving a cross into his forehead, but by telling a joke so good it lasted three decades. It\u2019s unbelievably sad that he has died at age 50; who knows what other madness he had in store for the world?\n\nFor a brief, glorious period a few months ago, it seemed like there might be a distant chance that GWAR would be the half-time show at the Super Bowl. The pairing of GWAR with one of America's smarmiest, most self-serious institutions may go down as one of the greatest missed opportunities in our cultural history. Mutant football players tackling each other's heads off onstage in a spray of fake blood? It would have been magical.", "428": "Gwar manager Jack Flanagan has made a statement following the death of frontman David Brockie aka Oderus Utungus.\n\nThe body of Brockie was discovered at his home in Richmond, Virginia on Sunday.

Former GWAR member Mike Bishop told reporters:\n\n\u201cDave was one of the funniest, smartest, most creative and energetic persons I\u2019ve known. He was brash sometimes, always crass, irreverent, he was hilarious in every way. But he was also deeply intelligent and interested in life, history, politics and art. His penchant for scatological humors belied a lucid wit. He was a criminally underrated lyricist and hard rock vocalist, one of the best, ever! A great frontman, a great painter, writer, he was also a hell of a bass guitarist. I loved him. He was capable of great empathy and had a real sense of justice.\u201d\n\nAt this time, the Brockie family ask that the press and media respect their privacy as they mourn the loss of their loved one.\n\nHow Did GWAR Frontman Dave Brockie Die?

Photo by Nic Pouliot.\n\nWhen news of David Brockie's death began circulating late Sunday, March 23, it was tempting to view it as a sick joke. Brockie - who went by the name of Oderus Urungus - was the lead singer for shock rock thrash band Gwar, after all, and his stage show consists of gallons of spewing fake blood, ginormous meaty and horned prosthetic costumes, and the \"crucifixion\" of historical and religious figures.\n\nBut both police and Gwar member Chris Bopst confirmed the next day that Brockie has indeed passed away at the age of 50, found by his roommate in their Richmond, Virginia, apartment. Foul play is not suspected.\n\nFormed at VCU art school in 1984, the satirical thrashers stood out in contrast to the era's pretty-boy, image-focused spandex-and-hairspray hard rock acts. Gwar were hugely image-focused, too, but went as ugly as possible, adopting characters and fictional stories about their origin, speaking in English and made-up gibberish during interviews. (Urungus claimed to be an intergalactic humanoid barbarian from the planet Scumdogia and 43 billion years old.)\n\nTheir song Sick Of You from 1990's Scumdogs Of The Universe was in regular rotation on MuchMusic's Power Hour, and they were nominated for two Grammys: in 1993 for best long form music video, and in 1996 for best metal performance.\n\nThe rotating cast of musicians - of whom Brockie was the only constant - toured on a steady, near-annual basis, releasing 13 albums and building a career on their obscene, gory live shows, to which fans liked to wear white and stand near the front to get drenched in fake blood. Not everyone's cup of tea, but undeniably entertaining. (Click here for a photo gallery and review of their November 2012 show at Sound Academy.)\n\nBrockie's death comes just three years after lead guitarist Cory Smoot's (aka Flattus Maximus), who died of coronary artery thrombosis while on tour.

Unlike other horror-influenced metal bands who merely splashed creature-feature art across album covers, Gwar took it to the stage and beyond, decked out in full costume as demonic barbarians. With a knowing wink, Brockie and his band leaned into the theatricality of their chosen genre, building outsize personalities\u2013and special effects flare\u2013to ratchet up what predecessors like Kiss had done, for an eager audience.\n\nDave Brockie on Stage with Gwar in 2011 Image: Flickr user Montecruz Foto\n\nBrockie founded Gwar in 1984, and the band soon went on to infiltrate both the metal scene and pop culture at large\u2013because there was nobody else quite like them. (Their influence would reach further generations, including bands like Mudvayne, who dressed like this at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards.) The band\u2019s famous costumes and garish concert set pieces helped establish their mythology as powerful aliens dead set on creating hell on Earth.

Established by the Pritzker family of Chicago in 1979, the prestigious award is widely regarded as \"the Nobel Prize\" in the architecture profession.\n\nShigeru Ban will be the seventh Japanese architect to become a Pritzker Laureate \u2014 following the late Kenzo Tange in 1987, Fumihiko Maki in 1993, Tadao Ando in 1995, the team of Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa in 2010, and Toyo Ito in 2013.\n\nShigeru Ban will officially accept the prize at a formal ceremony in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam on June 13, 2014. This will be the first time the ceremony will be held in The Netherlands.\n\nPast recipients in recent years include Toyo Ito (2013), Wang Shu (2012), Eduardo Souto de Moura (2011), SANAA (2010), and Peter Zumthor (2009). Laureates receive a $100,000 grant, a formal citation certificate, and a bronze medallion based on the designs of famed Chicago architect Louis Sullivan.\n\n\n\nFrom the winning announcement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Shigeru Ban, a Tokyo-born, 56-year-old architect with offices in Tokyo, Paris and New York, is rare in the field of architecture. He designs elegant, innovative work for private clients, and uses the same inventive and resourceful design approach for his extensive humanitarian efforts. For twenty years Ban has traveled to sites of natural and man-made disasters around the world, to work with local citizens, volunteers and students, to design and construct simple, dignified, low-cost, recyclable shelters and community buildings for the disaster victims.\n\n\n\nReached at his Paris office, Shigeru Ban said, 'Receiving this prize is a great honor, and with it, I must be careful. I must continue to listen to the people I work for, in my private residential commissions and in my disaster relief work. I see this prize as encouragement for me to keep doing what I am doing \u2014 not to change what I am doing, but to grow.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all parts of his practice, Ban finds a wide variety of design solutions, often based around structure, materials, view, natural ventilation and light, and a drive to make comfortable places for the people who use them. From private residences and corporate headquarters, to museums, concert halls and other civic buildings, Ban is known for the originality, economy, and ingeniousness of his works, which do not rely on today\u2019s common high-tech solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo construct his disaster relief shelters, Ban often employs recyclable cardboard paper tubes for columns, walls and beams, as they are locally available; inexpensive; easy to transport, mount and dismantle; and they can be water- and fire-proofed, and recycled. He says that his Japanese upbringing helps account for his wish to waste no materials.\n\n\n\nAs a boy, Shigeru Ban observed traditional Japanese carpenters working at his parents\u2019 house and to him their tools, the construction, and the smells of wood were magic. He would save cast aside pieces of wood and build small models with them. He wanted to become a carpenter. But at age eleven, his teacher asked the class to design a simple house and Ban\u2019s was displayed in the school as the best. Since then, to be an architect was his dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBan\u2019s humanitarian work began in response to the 1994 conflict in Rwanda, which threw millions of people into tragic living conditions. Ban proposed paper-tube shelters to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and they hired him as a consultant. After the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, he again donated his time and talent. There, Ban developed the \u201cPaper Log House,\u201d for Vietnamese refugees in the area, with donated beer crates filled with sandbags for the foundation, he lined up the paper cardboard tubes vertically, to create the walls of the houses. Ban also designed \u201cPaper Church,\u201d as a community center of paper tubes for the victims of Kobe. It was later disassembled and sent to Taiwan, and reconstructed there, in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBan works with local victims, students, and other volunteers to get these disaster relief projects built. In 1995, he founded a non-governmental organization (NGO) called VAN: Voluntary Architects\u2019 Network. With VAN, following earthquakes, tsunami, hurricanes, and war, he has conducted this work in Japan, Turkey, India, Sri Lanka, China, Haiti, Italy, New Zealand, and currently, the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker Prize jury chairman, The Lord Palumbo, said, 'Shigeru Ban is a force of nature, which is entirely appropriate in the light of his voluntary work for the homeless and dispossessed in areas that have been devastated by natural disasters. But he also ticks the several boxes for qualification to the Architectural Pantheon \u2014 a profound knowledge of his subject with a particular emphasis on cutting-edge materials and technology; total curiosity and commitment; endless innovation; an infallible eye; an acute sensibility \u2014 to name but a few.'\n\nThe citation from the Pritzker Prize jury underscores Ban\u2019s experimental approach to common materials such as paper tubes and shipping containers, his structural innovations, and creative use of unconventional materials such as bamboo, fabric, paper, and composites of recycled paper fiber and plastics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distinguished jury that selected the 2014 Pritzker Laureate consists of its chairman, The Lord Palumbo, internationally known architectural patron of London, Chairman Emeritus of the Trustees, Serpentine Galleries, former Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain, former Chairman of the Tate Gallery Foundation; and alphabetically: Alejandro Aravena, architect and Executive Director of Elemental in Santiago, Chile; Stephen Breyer, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Washington, D.C.; Yung Ho Chang, architect and educator, Beijing, The People\u2019s Republic of China; Kristin Feireiss, architecture curator, writer, and editor, Berlin, Germany; Glenn Murcutt, architect and 2002 Pritzker Laureate, Sydney, Australia; Juhani Pallasmaa, architect, professor and author, Helsinki, Finland; and Ratan N.

Where others may see insurmountable challenges, Ban sees a call to action. Where others might take a tested path, he sees the opportunity to innovate. He is a committed teacher who is not only a role model for younger generation, but also an inspiration.\" \u2014 Pritzker Jury 2014\n\nCiting his innovative approach to structure and material as well as his commitment to compassionate design, the Pritzker Jury has selected Japanese architect Shigeru Ban as the 2014 winner of the Pritzker Prize. Ban is the thirty-eighth recipient of the Pritzker Prize and its seventh Japanese recipient.\n\nBan, who studied at Sci-Arc and Cooper Union, first gained international recognition for his experimental, creative use of unconventional materials, particularly paper and cardboard. However, he has more recently gained fame for bringing low-cost, high-quality design to those most in need of it, such as refugees and victims of natural disaster.\n\nAccording to the jury, the Pritzker Prize recognizes architects who both display \"excellence in built work and who make a significant and consistent contribution to humanity.\" Shigeru Ban, whose approach is as innovative as it is humanitarian, \"reflects this spirit of the prize to the fullest.\"\n\nRead the Jury's full citation:\n\nJury Citation 2014\n\nSince its establishment thirty-five years ago, the goal of the Pritzker Architecture Prize is to recognize living architects for excellence in built work and who make a significant and consistent contribution to humanity.\n\nShigeru Ban, the 2014 laureate, reflects this spirit of the prize to the fullest. He is an outstanding architect who, for twenty years, has been responding with creativity and high quality design to extreme situations caused by devastating natural disasters. His buildings provide shelter, community centers, and spiritual places for those who have suffered tremendous loss and destruction. When tragedy strikes, he is often there from the beginning, as in Rwanda, Turkey, India, China, Italy, and Haiti, and his home country of Japan, among others.\n\nHis creative approach and innovation, especially related to building materials and structures, not merely good intentions, are present in all his works. Through excellent design, in response to pressing challenges, Shigeru Ban has expanded the role of the profession; he has made a place at the table for architects to participate in the dialogue with governments and public agencies, philanthropists, and the affected communities. His sense of responsibility and positive action to create architecture of quality to serve society\u00b4s needs, combined with his original approach to these humanitarian challenges, make this year\u00b4s winner an exemplary professional.\n\nThe recipient has an exceptionally wide-ranging career. Since founding his first office in Tokyo in 1985 and later expanding to New York and Paris, he has undertaken projects that range from minimal dwellings, experimental houses and housing, to museums, exhibition pavilions, conference and concert venues, and office buildings.\n\nAn underpinning uniting much of his built work is his experimental approach. He has expanded the architectural field regarding not only the problems and challenges he tackles, but also regarding the tools and techniques to deal with them. He is able to see in standard components and common materials, such as paper tubes, packing materials or shipping containers, opportunities to use them in new ways. He is especially known for his structural innovations and the creative use of unconventional materials like bamboo, fabric, paper, and composites of recycled paper fiber and plastics.\n\nIn Naked House, he was able to question the traditional notion of rooms and consequently domestic life, and simultaneously create a translucent, almost magical atmosphere. This was done with modest means: walls externally clad in clear corrugated plastic and sections of white acrylic stretched internally across a timber frame. This sophisticated layered composition of ordinary materials used in a natural and efficient way, provides comfort, efficient environmental performance and simultaneously a sensual quality of light.\n\nHis own studio, atop a terrace at the Pompidou Center in Paris for the six years he was working on the museum project for Metz, was built using cardboard tubes and a membrane covering the arched roof. He has also used transportation containers as ready-made elements in museum construction. His body of work is proof of his ability to add value through design. Further new conceptual and structural ideas were developed and can be seen in PC Pile House, House of Double Roof, Furniture House, Wall-less House, and Nine-Square Grid House.\n\nAnother theme that runs through his work is the spatial continuity between interior and exterior spaces. In Curtain Wall House, he uses tent-like movable curtains to easily link interior and exterior, yet provide privacy when needed. The fourteen-story Nicolas G. Hayek Center in Tokyo is covered with glass shutters on front and back facades that can be fully opened.\n\nFor Shigeru Ban, sustainability is not a concept to add on after the fact; rather, it is intrinsic to architecture. His works strive for appropriate products and systems that are in concert with the environment and the specific context, using renewable and locally produced materials, whenever possible. Just one example is his newly opened Tamedia office building in Zurich, which uses an interlocking timber structural system, completely devoid of joint hardware and glue.\n\nHis great knowledge of structure and his appreciation for such masters as Mies van der Rohe and Frei Otto have contributed to the development and clarity of his buildings. His own architecture is direct and honest. However, it is never ordinary, and each new project has an inspired freshness about it. The elegant simplicity and apparent effortlessness of his works are really the result of years of practice and a love for building. Above all, his respect for the people who inhabit his buildings, whether victims of natural disaster or private clients or the public, is always revealed through his thoughtful approach, functional plans, carefully selected appropriate materials, and the richness of spaces he creates.\n\nShigeru Ban is a tireless architect whose work exudes optimism. Where others may see insurmountable challenges, Ban sees a call to action. Where others might take a tested path, he sees the opportunity to innovate. He is a committed teacher who is not only a role model for younger generation, but also an inspiration.\n\nFor all these reasons, Shigeru Ban is the 2014 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate.\n\nSee more of ArchDaily's coverage of this year's Pritzker Prize here >", "437": "20. Will We Hear About Moira MacTaggert?\n\nOne of the most anticipated films of summer 2014 is X-Men Days of Future Past, which is based on the famous story arc from the X-Men comics written by Chris Claremont. It also welcomes the return of Bryan Singer \u0080\u0093 who helmed the first two X-Men films \u0080\u0093 to the director's seat. The story arc the film is based on concerns a dystopian future where mutants are being hunted down by giant robots called Sentinels and placed in concentration camps. The adult Kitty Pryde transfers her mind into younger self's mind so she can prevent the event that led to this future \u0080\u0093 the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly by the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This is the most ambitious X-Men film to date, considering it deals with time travel and features a large ensemble cast \u0080\u0093 including returning original cast members such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen \u0080\u0093 as well as James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender from 2011's X-Men First Class. With only a little over two months until the film's release here are 20 questions that still need to be answered.Rose Byrne played Moira MacTaggert in First Class. In that film Moira \u0080\u0093 who is a Scottish doctor in the comics \u0080\u0093 became an American C.I.A agent who worked alongside Xavier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. At the end of First Class Xavier wiped her memory so that she wouldn't be able to tell anyone about the X-Men's location or actions. Byrne has said Moira isn't involved in Days of Future's Past story but it'd be nice to hear what the character is doing 11 years later. It'd add more texture to the X-Men universe and make it clear to the audience that characters- even if they don't appear- aren't completely forgotten. Has Moira remembered the events of First Class? Has she moved up the ranks of the C.I.A? First Class made a point about the sexism prevalent in the C.I.A. so it'd be an interesting character development for her to have a higher position. Moira and Xavier had somewhat of a budding romance in First Class. How much does Xavier regret not keeping her in his life?", "438": "This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nIf 20th Century Fox wants you to have one takeaway from the new X-Men: Days of Future Past trailer, the first to really feature big action details from the film (due out May 23), it's that Bryan Singer directed it. \"THE DIRECTOR OF X-MEN AND X2,\" aka the ones everyone liked. The other big takeaway: everyone's in this thing! Champion bros Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, the immortal Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Sentinels, the list goes on and on.\n\nThe time-jumping film's first trailer was released while it was still filming, so it was basically just Stewart and McKellen, as older Professor Xavier and Magneto, telling Wolverine that he'd have to journey into the past to save them from their terrible future. We get a better glimpse at that future here, featuring giant evil spiky Sentinel robots, who clearly have it out for Storm.\n\nBut it's likely that most of the action will take place in the '70s, which gives Jennifer Lawrence ample opportunity to crack open her American Hustle wardrobe. Jackman's Wolverine basically never ages, so he can be in all the X-Men franchise titles Fox is planning for the next ten years, but otherwise, the convoluted time-travel antics at work here will likely serve as a torch-passing to the younger cast.\n\nWe've also got plenty of new mutants to ogle!

Is the future truly set?\n\nThe official poster was released alongside the trailer [20TH CENTURY FOX]\n\nIt sees Jennifer Lawrence reprising her role as Mystique [YOUTUBE]\n\nThe latest instalment in the Marvel comics saga, directed by Bryan Singer, will see Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman sent into the past in an attempt to change history and save the future of the human and mutant races. Charles, played by both James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart, must team up with Magneto, played by Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen, to save the mutants from extinction but as the trailer shows it\u2019s not going to be easy getting the bitter rivals together. \"Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction,\" Charles declares while pictures of the X-Men flash up, including Magneto, Wolverine, steel-skinned Colossus, Warpath, Blink, Sunspot and Iceman.\n\nFans have been left excited by the full length trailer ahead of its May release [YOUTUBE]\n\nAnd contrary to recent rumours, Halle Berry's Storm is very much present in several scenes of the trailer - one with her in full-on Mistress of the Elements mode as she rains down all hell on the apocalyptic landscape. Jennifer Lawrence is also seen reprising her role as Mystique. Bryan Singer, who was also responsible for the first two X-Men films, has already begun work on the next, X-Men: Apocalypse, which will be released in 2016.", "441": "In \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past,\u201d Shawn Ashmore returns to the role of Bobby \u201cIceman\u201d Drake for the first time since 2006\u2019s \u201cX-Men: The Last Stand.\u201d And based on the newest trailer, which featured the debut of Drake\u2019s iconic ice-slide move, fans can expect cooler Iceman action than previous films allowed.\n\n\u201cIn \u2018X3,\u2019 I turned into Iceman for the first time,\u201d Ashmore told Entertainment Magazine in an interview earlier this month while promoting \u201cThe Following,\u201d his Fox TV series co-starring Kevin Bacon. \u201cI had made ice-balls, and an ice-rose for Rogue at one point, but full Iceman mode debuted in the battle against Pyro in \u2018The Last Stand.\u2019 Fans can definitely look forward to more of that.\u201d\n\nAshmore teases that Iceman isn\u2019t the only original X-Man getting an action upgrade, too. According to the actor, \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d features a grander scale than ever seen before in an \u201cX-Men\u201d film, both in terms of the set pieces and the storytelling.\n\n\u201cThe general scale of the storytelling is huge. It\u2019s massive. I walked onto some of the sets on the first day and it was the size of a football field. The whole set, you can interact on, like a battlefield, essentially,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that we know these characters, we either love or hate them, depending on which side we\u2019re on. Now you can really open it up to bigger storytelling and bigger action because you understand these characters. There are higher stakes. You can put these people in danger because you care about them.\u201d\n\nThe Iceman actor credits that expanded scale to the return of director Bryan Singer, the man who \u201cstarted this journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to come back and have that same director,\u201d said Ashmore. \u201cThere\u2019s a trust. I know how important this movie is to him.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d is important to fans of Bobby Drake and Rogue\u2019s romance, however, they\u2019re going to walk away disappointed. Anna Paquin was cut from the film late last year, presumably impacting Iceman\u2019s storyline as well.\n\n\u201cThere was a storyline that had this great sequence with Rogue,\u201d he said. \u201cRemnants of those story lines still interact with some of the other characters, so I can\u2019t give anything away.\u201d\n\nEven without Rogue, Ashmore promised that Iceman will have screen-time with other fan-favorite heroes and villains, including Ian McKellen\u2019s Magneto and Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing Bobby for thirteen years. This is my fourth movie playing Iceman,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d opens on May 23.", "442": "A second trailer for \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" has been released, featuring an extended look at the peril that faces the world's most beloved mutants.\n\nThe trailer was uploaded to the \"X-Men\" Movies' official Youtube page on March 24, following the release of the first full-length trailer in October 2013. Video of the trailer can be viewed below.\n\n\"So many battles waged over the years, and yet, none of them like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change who we are and unite? Is the future truly set,\" Patrick Stewart's character, Charles Xavier, says in the trailer.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" blends members of the original \"X-Men\" films, including Stewart, plus Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry, with cast from the 2011 series reboot \"X-Men: First Class,\" such as James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, who play younger versions of the original cast.\n\nThe movie centers around a war that's spread across to time periods, in which the mutants of today attempt to stop the war before it begins by traveling back to the past. The second trailer prominently features more of the integral characters in this plot, such as Professor Charles Xavier (McAvoy, Stewart), Magneto (Fassbender, McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), and Mystique (Lawrence), whereas the first trailer gave minor glimpses of the large ensemble.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" also stars the likes of Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Nicholas Hoult and Shawn Ashmore. The movie hits theaters on May 23, 2014.\n\nWatch the second full-length trailer for the film below.", "443": "ANOTHER WEEK, another chance for a film studio that isn\u2019t Disney\u2019s Marvel to prove it can make a good Marvel movie.\n\nLast week, it was Sony reassuring fans with an \u201cAmazing Spider-Man 2\u201d trailer. This week, it\u2019s 20th Century Fox bearing the latest \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d trailer \u2014 giving fans reason, perhaps, to believe in the future of the franchise.\n\nHere are our 5 Takeaways From the New X-Trailer:\n\n1. Magneto and Xavier: The best of frenemies\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take the two of us. Side by side at a time when we couldn\u2019t be further apart,\u201d Magneto says of the future. The trailer shows that \u201cX-Men: DOFP\u201d will feature the Professor X/Magneto relationship in two ways: In the future, the two will be allies; they look old, tired, defeated and desperate as they let Wolverine know he must travel in time and reunite them in the past if there is any hope of saving the future for mutants.\n\nIn the past, well, Wolverine is going to have his work cut out for him, with the younger professor and a younger, much stronger Magneto clearly at odds with each other. Xavier seems to have taken quite personally the alliance (and possibly something more) that Mystique has with Magneto \u2014 while Magneto lets the professor know that he should have paid more attention to those he cared about. Xavier, despite his powers, seems unsure of himself in the past, while Magneto of the past has clearly embraced his role as the master of magnetism.\n\n2. Sentinels\n\nWe knew we\u2019d be getting a better look at the Sentinels in the latest trailer once the \u201cX-Men: DOFP\u201d production team had more time to work with special effects \u2014 though the Sentinels still don\u2019t get much screen time. (Of course, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, given how much fanboys can complain about [pseudo-]spoilers in trailers and other clips.)\n\nThe sentinels are going to be a problem. They are the weapon of choice in the war against mutants, who are perceived as a threat by Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). Again, not much to be seen regarding the X-Men\u2019s greatest threat, but it seems as though we can look forward to intense battles (Sentinels vs. Colossus and of course, Sentinels vs. Magneto).\n\n3. A quick look at Quicksilver\n\nThe Internet sure got ornery when a first look at Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff \u2014 a.k.a. Quicksilver, the super-speedster son of Magneto \u2014 was revealed. Some fanboys had declared that the version of Quicksilver who appears in \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d would be better \u2014 without ever seeing any big-screen images. The only thing we\u2019ve seen of \u201cX-Men\u2019s\u201d Quicksilver is his choice of wardrobe, which seems to have upset many. Let\u2019s cut him a little slack, given that it\u2019s the \u201970s and what he\u2019s wearing is probably the best of what was available in silver (plus, you know, points for that Pink Floyd/\u201dDark Side\u2026\u201d T-shirt). And once we actually see Quicksilver in super-speed action, most of us will likely get over Pietro\u2019s \u201970s duds. (Now, do we forgive Mystique/Jennifer Lawrence for her \u201cI totally got to keep my \u2018American Hustle\u2019 threads\u201d fashion choice?)\n\n4. Iceman \u2026 the real Iceman\n\nSeeing that Iceman/Bobby Drake (Shawn Ashmore) is a part of this \u201cX-Men\u201d is wonderful. Seeing that he\u2019s the real Iceman (and by real, we mean covered head to toe in ice) and not the \u201cfrosty-hands Iceman\u201d of the first two \u201cX-Men\u201d films is, well, awfully cool. Ashmore\u2019s frosting up completely into ice at the end of \u201cX-Men: The Last Stand\u201d was one of the few highlights of that film, which director Bryan Singer let get away from him. And not only do we get the real Iceman \u2014 we also get him zooming around on an ice-slide, just as in the old \u201cSpider-Man and His Amazing Friends\u201d cartoon.\n\n5. A bright cinematic future?\n\nThe future may appear doomed for mutants (even with Ellen Page back as our Kitty Pryde), but the future of X-Men movies looks strong with Singer, who seems poised to make this his triumphant return to the franchise. It\u2019s too soon to guess whether a movie stuffed with so many mutants can be effective. Nevertheless, with \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d already announced for 2016, Singer should feel at ease back in the X-saddle.\n\nYou can follow contributor David Betancourt on Twitter: @aDCfanboy", "444": "Bryan Singer is back with the X-Men series and looking at the trailer, the movie is seems to have lot of potential to be absolutely awesome! It took a while for the all the X-men fans to witness a proper trailer of X-Men: Days of Future Past, but it was definitely worth the wait. The X-Men series has a lot riding on this movie as the previous part X-Men: The Last Standing received quite lukewarm reviews.\n\nThis new trailer is every bit of exciting and spine-tingling as the previous one was! The cherry on top is that it includes all your favorite mutants like the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and younger and older versions of Professor X and Magneto!\n\nThis movie includes am ultimate war for the survival of the species between the two time periods i.e. the past and the future. In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the most loved characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class, in an epic battle that must change the past to save the future!\n\nIf the director Bryan Singer, manages to restore the dark and realistic tone of the X-Men and X 2, then this movie is going to be the X-Men 3 which we always wanted! The movie is set release on 5th May, 2014, and if the movie turns out to be as good as the trailer is, then we definitely have a summer treat!\n\nWatch the super awesome trailer of X-Men: Days of Future Past here:\n\n", "445": "Home News Tim Falkenberg March 24th, 2014 - 6:13 PM\n\nThere\u2019s a new trailer for X-Men: Rise of the Machines today. Wait, that\u2019s not right. X-Men: Enter the Matrix? No? Oh yeah, X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\n\n\nIf you weren\u2019t clued in by the first trailer for the movie, this isn\u2019t quite the same old X-Men \u2013 although this trailer is careful to emphasize that this one is \u201cFrom Bryan Singer, the Director of X-Men and X2: X-Men United\u201d without any mention of the other movies, save the implicit references to X-Men: First Class based on the carryover cast. Probably not a terrible move given the vitriol from both fans and critics over X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, neither of which Singer had anything to do with. (He wasn\u2019t involved with the more recent The Wolverine, either, but that movie included a Days of Future Past lead in with its post-credits scene.)\n\nThe similarities to other machine-apocalypse sci-fi like the above-referenced Terminator and Matrix franchises is kind of inescapable, which represents a hard departure from the modern world (or historical) grounding of the other X-Men movies. A futuristic look is probably implied by the title, but the visual similarities are striking nonetheless, and could be considered a strike against the film. On the other hand, it\u2019s been up front for a while now about including what are essentially mutant-hunting machine agents, so maybe we shouldn\u2019t hold that against the movie.\n\nAlso featured in the new trailer: roughly 50% more crying, as we see both Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Professor X the Younger (James McAvoy) with tears rolling down their faces, as well as our first look at Evan Peters as Quicksilver (at 1:10). What this really looks like, though, is the X-Men franchise\u2019s attempt to capture The Dark Knight style glory, roping in not only fans of the comic book, but also sci-fi aficionados as well the public at large. It\u2019s unclear at this juncture whether it will be able to rise to such lofty aspirations, but the trailer does preserve the hope that this movie might have some high-quality escapist fun even if it falls a little short of its target.\n\n20th Century Fox is set to release X-Men: Days of Future Past on May 23.", "446": "Mutants are out in full force in the latest X-Men: Days of Future Past trailer.

Instead of pulling at your heartstrings with dramatic scenes, there\u2019s plenty of action to keep your attention. Days of Future Past is a sequel like no other. It combines story lines from the original X-Men trilogy (2000-2006) with the Wolverine spinoffs (2009-present) and the 2011 First Class reboot.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past features characters of all ages and generations. Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart reprise their roles as Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy play younger versions of said characters. Hugh Jackman lets his claws out again as Wolverine as he bridges their two timelines.\n\nThe cast is very large, but includes superheroes old and new. Halle Berry returns as Storm, Jennifer Lawrence is back as Mystique and Nicholas Hoult reprises his role as Hank, aka Beast. They\u2019re joined by Ellen Page\u2019s Kitty Pryde and Shawn Ashmore\u2019s Bobby Drake, better known as Iceman.\n\nThe mutant race is on the verge of extinction, thanks to a man called Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). He\u2019s created an army of robots called Sentinels, whose mission is to protect humans at any cost. And, by protect, we mean eradicating the world of mutants.\n\nWatch the new trailer below:\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is directed by Bryan Singer and opens in theaters May 23.", "447": "Marvel has released another exclusive trailer for the upcoming \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" film.\n\nThe trailer shows Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) discussing how in order to end the war against mutants, they must work together to stop it before it happens. Wolverine travels back in time to convince a young Xavier he must rise above the mutiny to save the world from chaos.\n\n\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" also features Sentinels, robot weapons created to hunt and kill mutants. There is one scene shown in the trailer which a Sentinel sneaks up behind Storm (Halle Berry), but it is unclear if she survives the encounter with the deadly machines.\n\nYou can check out the newest trailer for the film in the video below. \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" will debut in theaters on May 23.\n\nThe Marvel film features both old and new generation of \"X-Men\" characters coexisting in the same universe through time travel. In an interview with Collider back in February, director Bryan Singer explained how the production was able to create a cohesive story line in a complex context.\n\n\"I wanted it to make sense, and very often with time travel, and this is a rare film where past and future are co-existing, so I had to create a set of rules where that made sense to me,\" Singer explained to Collider. \"So that's what I set about I do I created a very specific set of rules. When do things change? Who observes the change? Who has no memory of the change? Who has no memory of what was and who does, and how that works.\"\n\n\"I think I cracked it,\" he added. \"I think I figured it out but that was my first, when Matthew left the picture and I took it on, that didn't exist, there was a structure but there was no concept of time travel or how it works. So until I figured that out I had some misgivings about doing the movie. Once I figured that out I was very hooked, I felt like they had me cause I was like now I know how to do this and shoot this.\"", "448": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are expecting their first child\n\nShe may be recognized as the new face of Jim Beam bourbon, but actress Mila Kunis will soon be entering a world of baby bottles, booties and pacifiers within the next nine months.\n\nDespite rumors of twins, a source told E!

So a study like this one from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education is bound to draw attention.\n\nThe science on e-cigarettes is still young, adding to the confusion around the burgeoning $1.5 billion industry that the FDA will soon regulate. Absent federal oversight so far, some states and cities have enacted their own bans on the products, which deliver nicotine through a vaporized liquid instead of burning tobacco.\n\nResearchers writing in JAMA Internal Medicine found that use of e-cigarettes was not associated with \u201cgreater rates of quitting cigarettes or reduced cigarette consumption\u201d after one year. The authors reached the conclusion based on self-reported data from 949 smokers, which included 88 who used e-cigarettes.\n\nStill, they\u2019re the first to admit that their findings should be viewed with some caution. The study\u2019s small sample size could have hurt their ability to draw a relationship between e-cigarettes and quitting smoking, they wrote. They also didn\u2019t collect information on characteristics of use, such as motivation and frequency.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our data add to the current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking cessation,\u201d wrote authors Rachel Grana, Lucy Popova and Pamela Ling.\n\nMitchell Katz, editor of the research journal, acknowledges that the evidence on whether e-cigarettes help to stop smoking is \u201ccontradictory and inconclusive.\u201d Still, he argues, there\u2019s not enough evidence to claim that e-cigarettes do help people to quit.\n\n\u201cI agree with Grana and colleagues that sellers of e-cigarettes should not be able to advertise them as smoking cessation devices without sufficient evidence that they are effective for this indication,\u201d Katz wrote.\n\nTom Glynn of the American Cancer Society, whose advocacy arm has lobbied for strict e-cigarette regulation, said he\u2019s worried about the strong conclusion drawn by the study authors given the sample size and their own hedging.\n\n\u201cThis study has problems,\u201d said Glynn, ACS director of Cancer Science and Trends. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is even the authors talk about the limitations.\u201d\n\nThere hasn't been much previous research on this topic. A September study out of New Zealand found that e-cigarettes were \"modestly effective\" at helping people to quit smoking, about on par with nicotine patches.\n\nOther recent studies have been bearish on e-cigarettes\u2019 potential as a smoking cessation tool. A study published earlier this month in JAMA Pediatrics found that middle and high school students who smoked e-cigarettes were also more likely to smoke cigarettes. But experts were also split on the meaning of those findings, the New York Times reported.\n\nUltimately, the FDA is expected to soon issue regulations on how the products may be marketed and sold. The fierce lobbying battle that\u2019s played out in recent months shows just how high the stakes are for the industry\u2019s future.", "457": "E-cigarettes are often marketed as a bridge to quitting smoking, but recent data suggest the increasingly popular devices may not actually help smokers kick the habit. A new U.S. study casts doubt on the utility of electronic cigarettes as a quit-smoking tool.\n\nThe report, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that smokers who used e-cigarettes in addition to normal cigarettes were no more likely to quit than those who didn\u2019t use e-cigs. Researchers studied tobacco use among 949 smokers, 88 of whom also used e-cigarettes. Their data were based on self-reported responses over the course of one year.\n\n\"We did not find a relationship between using an e-cigarette and reducing cigarette consumption,\" Rachel Grana, lead author of the study, told Reuters.\n\nThe debate over whether e-cigarettes can help people quit smoking is murky, given that the science on the issue is still relatively sparse. Even the authors of the latest study admit their research consisted of a small sample size and they caution against using their data to draw any definitive conclusions. As the Washington Post notes, researchers failed to collect qualitative information about the smokers\u2019 habits, such as frequency or motivation.\n\n\"Nonetheless, our data add to current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking cessation,\u201d the authors wrote. \"Regulations should prohibit advertising claiming or suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices until claims are supported by scientific evidence.\"\n\nE-cigarettes first came on the market in China in 2004. Over the past decade, e-cigs have grown into a $2 billion industry. The battery-powered devices contain a liquid form of nicotine that is extracted from tobacco and infused with flavorings and colorings.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding e-cigs is over how strictly they should be regulated. Currently, the federal government does not regulate e-cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to set new standards for e-cigarettes, much like nicotine gums and patches, but has yet to lay out a plan.", "458": "A new, but relatively small, study suggests that e-cigarettes do not help smokers quit or reduce their use of conventional cigarettes.\n\nThe study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine looked at self-reports from 949 smokers\u201388 who used e-cigarettes at the start of the study\u2013and sought to determine whether e-cigarette use was linked to successfully quitting regular cigarettes, or at least lessening consumption at the end of a year.\n\nThe researchers found that this was not the case, and despite their small study size and time period, they concluded that their data adds to the current body of evidence that e-cigarettes do not help people quit smoking. \u201cRegulations should prohibit advertising claiming or suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices until claims are supported by scientific evidence,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nWhether e-cigarettes are a better option than tobacco cigarettes, or just an alternative way for smokers to inhale nicotine, is a question public health experts continue to debate. Since e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, some argue they are the lesser of two evils, and that encouraging people to use nicotine products on the less dangerous side of the spectrum is ultimately better for them, and could even help them wean them off actual cigarettes. The problem is that e-cigarettes have not been around long enough for accurate research on their perceived dangers or benefits.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Earlier this month, another study found that adolescents who use cigarettes are more likely to smoke other tobacco products and cigarettes. The study couldn\u2019t confirm whether smoking e-cigarettes made teens more likely to smoke in general, but it showed it wasn\u2019t a deterrent.\n\nIn a corressponding editorial, Dr. Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine wrote: \u201cUnfortunately, the evidence on whether e-cigarettes help smokers to quit is contradictory and inconclusive.

It\u2019s the first time in 20 years the virus has been reported in West Africa.\n\nEbola is one of the most deadly viruses known to mankind \u2013 there is no known cure.\n\nThe U.N. health agency said Tuesday at least 230 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola have been recorded so far in Guinea and Liberia. The statement said 129 deaths in Guinea and 13 in Liberia have been linked to the disease.\n\n\u201cThe Ebola fever is one of the most virulent diseases known to mankind with a fatality rate up to 90 per cent,\u201d said Ibrahima Toure, Guinea\u2019s country director for the aid group Plan International.\n\nCommunities in the affected region travel freely, making the risk of the epidemic spreading very real. Such a spread could have devastating consequences, Toure said.\n\nAbout Ebola fever\n\nThe first case of Ebola was reported in 1976 in Congo. The virus is named after the river where it was recognized.\n\nThe virus gained international attention in the 1990s and 2000s after hundreds of deaths were reported in Uganda and Congo.\n\nThere are five distinct strains of the virus: Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, Reston, Sudan and Zaire.\n\nThe virus can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The World Health Organization (WHO) said transmission of the virus has also occurred through the handling of sick or dead infected animals, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelopes and fruit bats.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Ebola haemorrhagic fever\n\nEbola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is often characterized by the sudden onset of intense weakness, fever, muscle pain, sore throat and headaches.\n\nThese symptoms are followed by diarrhea, vomiting, impaired liver and kidney function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding.\n\nIn later stages, some patients may bleed from their eyes, nose, ears, mouth or rectum. In some cases, patients may experience a bleeding or raised rash over their entire body.\n\nThe incubation period (the time from when the individual is exposed to the virus to when symptoms first appear) can range from two to 21 days.\n\nInfected people can spread Ebola for as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus.\n\nMost patients who become infected die.\n\nTreatment of EHF\n\nThere is no vaccine or treatment for EHF. Although a number of vaccines are currently being tested, the WHO said it could be years before a vaccine becomes available.\n\nIn severe cases, patients require intensive supportive care, including intravenous fluids to treat dehydration and maintaining the patient\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nPreventative measures\n\nOfficials in Guinea blasted out messages on state radio and television, urging people to wash their hands frequently and avoid contact with sick people.\n\nThe WHO said because there is no treatment, the only way to reduce death during an Ebola outbreak is to raise awareness of infection risk factors.\n\nThe public can reduce their risk of contracting EHF by limiting their exposure to infected animals, avoiding direct contact with infected people, and wearing gloves and protective clothing around those infected.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press", "460": "Workers from Doctors Without Borders unload emergency medical supplies to deal with an Ebola outbreak in Conakry, Guinea, on March 23, 2014.

The WHO estimates that around 2.9 billion people worldwide live in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel.\n\n\n\nFlavia Bustreo, a WHO family health expert, said women and children - especially those living in poor countries - often bear the brunt of the risks from indoor pollution \"since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cooking stoves.\"\n\n\n\nOutdoors, air is mainly polluted by transport, power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions and residential heating and cooking.\n\n\n\nResearch suggests outdoor air pollution exposure levels have risen significantly in some parts of the world, particularly in countries with large populations going through rapid industrialization, such as China and India.\n\n\n\nThe WHO's cancer research agency IARC published a report last year warning that the air we breathe is laced with cancer-causing substances and should be officially classified as carcinogenic to humans.\n\n\n\nCarlos Dora, a WHO public health expert, called on governments and health agencies to act on the evidence and devise policies to reduce air pollution, which in turn would improve health and reduce humans' impact on climate change.\n\n\n\n\"Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to healthcare cost savings as well as climate gains.\"", "465": "7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution\n\nNew estimates\n\nIn particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to air pollution\u2019s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution, but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology. This has enabled scientists to make a more detailed analysis of health risks from a wider demographic spread that now includes rural as well as urban areas.\n\nRegionally, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution.\n\n\u201cCleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly\u2026\u201d Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General Family, Women and Children\u2019s Health\n\n\u201cCleaning up the air we breathe prevents noncommunicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,\u201d says Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General Family, Women and Children\u2019s Health. \u201cPoor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the assessment is a breakdown of deaths attributed to specific diseases, underlining that the vast majority of air pollution deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases as follows:\n\nOutdoor air pollution-caused deaths \u2013 breakdown by disease:\n\n40% \u2013 ischaemic heart disease;\n\n40% \u2013 stroke;\n\n11% \u2013 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);\n\n6% \u2013 lung cancer; and\n\n3% \u2013 acute lower respiratory infections in children.\n\nIndoor air pollution-caused deaths \u2013 breakdown by disease:\n\n34% \u2013 stroke;\n\n26% \u2013 ischaemic heart disease;\n\n22% \u2013 COPD;\n\n12% \u2013 acute lower respiratory infections in children; and\n\n6% \u2013 lung cancer.\n\nThe new estimates are based on the latest WHO mortality data from 2012 as well as evidence of health risks from air pollution exposures. Estimates of people\u2019s exposure to outdoor air pollution in different parts of the world were formulated through a new global data mapping. This incorporated satellite data, ground-level monitoring measurements and data on pollution emissions from key sources, as well as modelling of how pollution drifts in the air.\n\nRisks factors are greater than expected\n\n\u201cThe risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,\u201d says Dr Maria Neira, Director of WHO\u2019s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \u201cFew risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter analysing the risk factors and taking into account revisions in methodology, WHO estimates indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution\u2019s role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers.\n\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, WHO estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide.\n\nMany people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the total estimate of around 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\n\u201cExcessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry. In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to health-care cost savings as well as climate gains,\u201d says Dr Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \u201cWHO and health sectors have a unique role in translating scientific evidence on air pollution into policies that can deliver impact and improvements that will save lives.\u201d\n\nThe release of today\u2019s data is a significant step in advancing a WHO roadmap for preventing diseases related to air pollution.

REUTERS/Olivia Harris\n\nUKFI, which manages the government\u2019s stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), said the sale would trim the government\u2019s stake in Lloyds to 25 percent.\n\nThe government began to offload its 39 percent shareholding in Lloyds last September, selling off a 6 percent stake to institutions such as pension funds and insurers.\n\nThat sale was seen as a milestone in Britain\u2019s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, during which taxpayers pumped a combined 66 billion pounds into Lloyds and RBS.\n\nBritain\u2019s finance ministry said on Tuesday that its priority was \u201cgetting the best value for the taxpayer, maximizing support for the economy and restoring private ownership\u201d.\n\n\u201cBuilding a stronger banking system is a core part of the government\u2019s long-term economic plan to deliver greater economic security,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said.\n\nThe first sale was priced at 75 pence per share, a 3 percent discount to the closing price of 77.36 pence on the date that it was launched, and ahead of the 73.6 pence price at which the government bought the shares.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told Reuters a similar discount to the market price is likely in the latest sale, with a price between 76 and 77 pence per share possible.\n\nShares in Lloyds closed at 79.11 pence on Tuesday.\n\nUKFI is expected to sell more shares later in the year in an offer which will include private retail investors. Sources familiar with the matter say that UKFI believes an offer to retail investors will be easier to execute once there is greater clarity over Lloyds\u2019 dividends prospects.\n\nThe sale is a vindication for Lloyds\u2019 Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, who has restored the bank to profitability since his appointment in 2011, simplifying the business to focus on lending to UK households and businesses.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the last three years to make Lloyds a safe and profitable bank that is focused on helping Britain prosper,\u201d Horta-Osorio said on Tuesday.\n\nBank of America, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS have been appointed to act as bookrunners.

UKFI\u2019s first sale in Lloyds last September was covered after an hour and tonight\u2019s trade is likely to have similar momentum.\n\nSeptember\u2019s sale represented a 6% stake and priced at 75p, a 3.05% discount to that day\u2019s close.\n\nLloyds shares closed this afternoon at 79.11p, up 0.78% for the day, where the sale would raise \u00a34.2bn, though a discount is likely.

[press release]\n\nPutting the Latest Number in Context\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and put Lynn Franco\u2019s interpretation in a larger perspective. The table here shows the average consumer confidence levels for each of the five recessions during the history of this monthly data series, which dates from June 1977. The latest number has moved 12.9 points above the recession mindset but remains 12.0 points below the non-recession average.\n\nThe chart below is another attempt to evaluate the historical context for this index as a coincident indicator of the economy. Toward this end I have highlighted recessions and included GDP. The exponential regression through the index data shows the long-term trend and highlights the extreme volatility of this indicator. Statisticians may assign little significance to a regression through this sort of data. But the slope clearly resembles the regression trend for real GDP shown below, and it is a more revealing gauge of relative confidence than the 1985 level of 100 that the Conference Board cites as a point of reference. Today\u2019s reading of 82.3 is now above the current regression point of 78.2.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nOn a percentile basis, the latest reading is at the 35.3 percentile of all the monthly readings since the start of the monthly data series in June 1977 and at the 31.0 percentile of non-recessionary months.\n\nFor an additional perspective on consumer attitudes, see my post on the most recent Reuters/University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Here is the chart from that post.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s take a look at the correlation between consumer confidence and small business sentiment, the latter by way of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index. As the chart illustrates, the two have tracked one another fairly closely since the onset of the Financial Crisis.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the next NFIB report echoes the bounce in consumer optimism.\n\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Doug Short from Advisor Perspectives.", "483": "U.S. consumer confidence rose in March to its highest in more than six years as expectations brightened, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 82.3, the highest since January 2008, from an upwardly revised 78.3 in February.

It was the strongest reading since the index stood at 87.3 in January 2008, just as the Great Recession was beginning.\n\nConference Board economist Lynn Franco said consumers are moderately more upbeat about future job prospects and the overall economy, though less optimistic about income growth.\n\n\u201cOverall, consumers expect the economy to continue improving and believe it may even pick up a little steam in the months ahead,\u201d Franco said.\n\nConsumer confidence is closely watched because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.\n\nThe strength in the index this month came from an increase in consumers\u2019 expectations, which offset a slight decline in their view of current conditions.\n\nThe number of people who felt jobs were hard to get rose slightly to 33 percent, up from 32.4 percent in February. Economists expect views about the labor market to brighten as employers increase the pace of hiring.\n\nEmployers added 175,000 jobs in February, far more than in the previous two months, and many private economists foresee solid job gains ahead.\n\nMany see the economy finally gaining momentum this year. The latest outlook from top forecasters at the National Association for Business Economics expect the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, will expand 3.1 percent this year. That would be a substantial increase from last year\u2019s lackluster 1.9 percent growth. If that target is reached, it would be the best performance in nine years.\n\nAn 18-month recession ended in the summer of 2009, and the recovery since then has been achingly slow. But the tax increases and spending cuts that dragged on growth last year will be less of a factor in 2014, according to many economists.\n\nFaster economic growth and more robust hiring would lift consumers\u2019 spirits and power stronger consumer spending, analysts say. That expectation for stronger growth, though, doesn\u2019t include the first three months of 2014, when severe winter storms raked parts of the country.\n\nThe NABE forecasters expect January-March economic activity to expand at an annual rate of 1.9 percent but then recover to a 2.8 percent growth rate in the April-June quarter.\n\nAt its December, January and March meetings, the Federal Reserve trimmed its monthly bond purchases and indicated that the economy, as it gains momentum, will need less support through such bond purchases.

They just hope that it will come at some point over the next six months, or maybe they\u2019re just feeling more optimistic because winter is finally ending.\u201d\n\nEconomists look at gauges of consumer confidence to get a feeling for the direction of consumer spending. Although confidence in March reached a multi-year high, the Conference Board\u2019s report indicates that the share of respondents with plans to purchase cars and homes declined, while plans to buy appliances rose.\n\nDetails of the Conference Board\u2019s report show an improvement in consumers\u2019 expectations for business conditions and employment.

If we continue to hold for longer than three seconds, Zoe locks into video mode, which is meant to make it easier to capture memories without worrying about switching modes.\n\nFitbit\n\nWearable devices are the new black, and HTC knows it. The company has partnered with Fitbit for the HTC One (M8), and will have the app loaded onto the device straight away. While we could always get the Fitbit app for our Android device, it does show HTC\u2019s dedication to wearables \u2014 and they they don\u2019t have one of their own.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only new touches HTC has made, but they are a quick overview of what we will have in store. We\u2019ll be getting in-depth with some of the newer features HTC made in other posts, so be sure to check back for all the news on the new HTC One (M8). We\u2019re excited for this one, and it seems HTC has once again captured our attention with a fantastic flagship device.\n\n", "488": "HTC 'makes it gorgeous' with new smartphone\n\nBy Mary Lennighan, Total Telecom\n\nTuesday 25 March 14\n\nTaiwanese handset maker launches high-end phone, but can it cope with rivals' marketing firepower?\n\n\"I bet most of the people in this room are doing it 150-200 times per day,\" said Scott Croyle, HTC's global design head, presenting the Taiwanese handset maker's much-hyped new smartphone at a launch event in London on Tuesday. He was referring, of course, to the frequency with which smartphone users hit the power button on their device in order to perform a simple function, such as checking the time or launching an application.

For the sake of making this preview easy to read, we'll refer to the new HTC One as the M8, which is it's official name, while the old One will be called the M7.\n\nDesign\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of the M8's body has been constructed from metal. The details that render the craftsmanship beautiful really have to be seen up close. The metal body has a hairline brushed finish to it, and the edging of the smartphone has been chamfered with diamond polish.\n\nMetal is a worrying material to use on a smartphone. It is conducive of heat and it could potentially interfere with cellular and internet connections. HTC's product manager Darren Sng reassured Good Gear Guide during a private briefing that HTC has overcome any obstacles.\n\n\"Despite being metal, we've managed to improve IR, Wi-Fi and cellular signals\", Sng said.\n\nThe older M7 had two capacitive touch buttons -- rather than the Android standard three -- that really hindered how you use the smartphone. HTC has avoided making the same mistake twice by ditching keys altogether in favour of on-screen buttons.\n\nThe screen can afford to forego some space as it is a larger 5-inches and has a native Full HD (1920x1080) resolution. This gives the HTC M8 a density of 441 pixels-per-inch, and that's higher than Sony's Xperia Z2 and Samsung's Galaxy S5. It's also more than a hundred pixels-per-inch more than Apple's iPhone 5S.\n\nComplementing the screen are enhanced BoomSound speakers. HTC's partnership with Beats has come to an end, but it appears to have had little effect on the company as the new stereo speakers are 25 per cent louder.\n\nAn ergonomic curve makes the HTC M8 comfortable to hold. Various traits hint that this is a second generation device, but there are a couple of characteristics that are new, innovative and exciting. Above the familiar 4MP Ultrapixel camera is a -- wait for it -- secondary camera. HTC has also incorporated a dual-colour LED flash, and it should improve group photos taken at night.\n\nThe DuoCamera\n\nHTC is betting on its camera technology once again to help set its smartphone apart from Samsung's Galaxy S5 and Sony's Xperia Z2. The Ultrapixel camera outperformed rivals in low-light situations. The new DuoCamera takes that technology and adds the ability to refocus images after they have been saved.\n\nThe camera isolates people in the foreground and makes it possible to blur the background for a bokeh effect. What really impressive is how accurately it separates the elements. Clippings aren't pixelated and the DuoCamera is adept at recognising fine details, such as fingers.\n\nHTC has optimised this function by adding a suite of effects. Snowflakes can cascade down the photo, but because the camera knows where you're standing, the snowflakes that drop behind you will disappear. The company has even made the SDK details available to software developers in an effort to ramp up options.\n\nIsolating the foreground from the background is made possible by the information ascertained by the secondary camera. It measures the placement of objects within an image. \"We are capturing vector depth information,\" Sng said. \"There are infinite focus points,\" he added.\n\nOther notable camera specifications include the ability to focus in 0.3 of a second, a sensor that captures 300 per cent more light \"than a standard 13MP sensor on a smartphone camera\", and the ability to capture 11 frames per second in burst mode.\n\nThe Selfie phone\n\nSony and Samsung's upcoming flagships have a 2MP front facing camera. HTC's One (M8) comes with a 5MP front camera that has f/2.0 aperture and a wide angle. Technically this means the front M8 camera is a higher resolution that the Ultrapixel camera found on its back. However, HTC claims the front camera's low-light sensitivity deems it superior.\n\nOn paper the HTC M8 is neck-to-neck with the Samsung Galaxy S5. The Android smartphone has a Snapdragon 801 2.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of RAM and, in Australia, it will ship with 16GB of internal storage. A new addition compared to the M7 is support for 128GB microSD memory cards.\n\nThe 4G smartphone has a clever 2600 milliamp-hour battery. HTC's Sng claims the M8 can last 40 per cent longer than the original M7, and that is despite it featuring more powerful components. A full charge will see the smartphone last for 10 days on standby in Extreme Power Mode, Sng said.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe HTC M8 will ship with the latest 4.4 KitKat version of Android differentiated by HTC's proprietary Sense 6 user interface.\n\nSense has undergone several refinements that make it look better and help it deliver more relevant information. Applications are now thematically linked by colour, while the BlinkFeed interface now bundles related newstories and presents in-line pictures. HTC's SenseTV interface has been overhauled too, and the company has followed Samsung's example in fitting the smartphone with a fitness application.\n\nWhere can I buy it?\n\nAustralians can get there hands on the new HTC One (M8) in April of 2014. The smartphone will be available in Gun Metal Gray and Glazier Silver at launch, and there is an Amber Gold version that could be launched at a later date.", "490": "By now, you're probably tired of hearing about the HTC One M8. After all that's about all we've written about today. But today is HTC's day so they get the entire spotlight. HTC has made the device official earlier today at their event and the HTC One M8 is available for your ordering pleasure through Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T. However, Verizon has the device available in stores right now - or in the next few minutes depending on when you're reading this. HTC has also posted the official introductory video for the HTC One M8 and some press shots of the device. Which we thought we'd put into a nice post for everyone to check out.\n\nThe HTC One M8 is going to be available in over 100 countries on April 10th. That's just a day before Samsung is launching the Galaxy S5 in over a hundred countries. Coincidence? The HTC One M8 also features a 5-inch 1080p Super LCD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.3GHz, along with 2GB of RAM, and a 2600mAh battery inside. It's also running on Android 4.4.2 and Sense 6. The most interesting part about the HTC One M8 is the cameras. There are actually three cameras on this bad boy. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel camera, and on the back there's a 2-megapixel up top and a 4.1-megapixel UltraPixel camera below that. No, there's no 3D capabilities here, thankfully.\n\nFor those of you interested in the HTC One M8, you may want to take a gander throughout the gallery below and check out the video as well. It's a nice looking device with top-of-the-line specs. I just hope that HTC doesn't get screwed again like last year, when they ran out of processors because other OEMs had bought them all up.", "491": "So, with today being March 25th and all, the HTC One (M8) is finally an official device, and it's going to be available across the globe in a matter of days. In fact, today you can go and pick one up in the States! Whether or not this availability is what caused all of the leaks, it's still impressive to be able to roll out a global launch on this scale to so many markets around the world. So, we know it's going to be going on sale globally, and that those in the US can head out to stores today to get their hands on one, but what about our friends across the pond in the UK?\n\nThankfully, it's much the same story in the UK, with all major retailers and networks offering some sort of way to purchase the device starting from today. Mega-retailer Carphone Warehouse will be selling the device in select stores in London from 4 PM today including Westfield Stratford, Westfield White City, Oxford Circus, Centre Point, Tottenham Court Road and their in Selfridges. However, if you're not in London, you can simply order one over the phone before it hits the rest of their stores. Onto the networks and Vodafone has the device up for grabs throughout London as well, and will be selling the device on their website this evening from 6 PM onwards, but deliver won't be until after March 27th or so. The first 3,000 to order from Vodafone will also get a free HTC Boombass, which is basically a portable subwoofer to fill out the BoomSound speakers on the One. EE is offering the device in both Gunmetal Grey and Glacial Silver starting tomorrow and in store come March 27th, with Three wanting \u00a349 a month upfront, with \u00a344 a month getting you unlimited data and such. O2 has announced that they will be carrying the device, but has skimped on the specifics, and Phones 4 U will be offering the device in all stores from march 27th onwards, with the Amber Gold hitting those stores pretty soon.\n\nWith the HTC One (M8) being released so soon after the launch, can HTC take Samsung head on? We'd love to hear from our UK readers, so don't hesitate to reach out!", "492": "HTC has announced there will be a HTC One M8 Google Play Edition available in the US only.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get your hands on a pure stock Android version of the new HTC One M8, you\u2019ll need to be an American resident or go online.\n\nThe HTC One M8 Play Edition will pack all the same hardware as the standard model, but lack HTC\u2019s Sense 6 UI.\n\nIt will be available to pre-order on the US Google Play Store soon, with a price tag of $699 (\u00a3425).\n\nThe HTC One M8 offers a 5-inch full 1080p HD display running Android 4.4.2 KitKat, powered by a 2.3GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 2GB of RAM.\n\nThere is 16GB or 32GB of internal storage available, both bolstered by microSD card expansion with support for cards up to 128GB.\n\nThe device is 4G LTE compatible and comes with NFC and Wi-Fi connectivity as well.\n\nIn the rear is a 4-megapixel UltraPixel camera, but HTC has introduced a HTC Duo dual-sensor camera to gain extra depth information for a better photo.\n\nIt is powered by a 2,600mAh battery and is available now from select retailers in the UK.\n\nRead more: HTC One M8 Deals", "493": "HTC has officially unveiled the new One. The company revealed its latest Android flagship during a worldwide launch event today. And while it may carry the same name as its predecessor, the new One features a tweaked design with a larger display, curvier metal sides, and a dual-camera system. But you probably already knew all of that, since it's the same device that's appeared in numerous leaks over the last couple months. \"It takes the best smartphone in the world and makes it better in every way,\" CEO Peter Chou said on stage in New York City. \"The design is so pure and honest.\"\n\nThe new One is coming to over 230 carriers in more than 100 countries. By the end of April, HTC says it will reach the US, Australia, Taiwan, the UK, Germany, France, and China. But North American customers won't need to wait that long. Starting today at 1PM, you can order the device from AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, Rogers, Bell, and Telus for immediate shipping. Verizon customers get the jump on everyone: it's available in-store starting today. The going on-contract rate is $199, though some carriers are hiking that up to $249.\n\nYou can walk into a Verizon store and buy a new One later today\n\nThe new One features a 5-inch, 1080p screen (which works out to 440 ppi) and is powered by the brand-new Snapdragon 801 processor. It also includes a microSD card slot, crossing off a major complaint about last year's version. Above all else, it carries over the gorgeous brushed metal design of the original One. In fact, HTC says it's improved the manufacturing process while cutting down on the total number of parts in the phone. \"We went the extra mile to do this the right way at the hardware level,\" Chou said.\n\nIt runs the sixth iteration of HTC's Sense Android software. \"We've redesigned Sense from top to bottom, touching every pixel along the way,\" said HTC's Jonah Becker. Sixth Sense, as the company is calling it, retains many features from last year like BlinkFeed (HTC's Flipboard-like home screen), Zoe, and a TV remote, but flattens the overall appearance into something more \"intuitive\" and \"bold.\" BlinkFeed is now open to third-party developers, and HTC has already brought Foursquare and Fitbit on board. But for those who prefer stock Android, a Google Play edition of the device will be made available soon.\n\nA significant boost in battery life\n\nHTC has also worked to better the new One's battery life, claiming a 40 percent improvement over the original. A new power-saver mode can limit your phone to its essential functions when the battery is nearly depleted, ensuring you'll make it to a charger before it dies completely.\n\nThe new One includes support for a number of new gestures that make it easier to turn on the screen, access BlinkFeed, and more \u2014 all without needing to hit the power button on top. For the camera, HTC has again gone with its UltraPixel system, but says the camera software has been simplified and seen several improvements (think filters). The second camera on back captures depth information for each shot, letting users refocus their images after the fact.\n\nIf you're rough with your phone, you'll be glad to hear that the new One is covered under HTC's Advantage warranty program. Should your screen somehow wind up shattered within six months of purchase, the company will replace it at no charge. HTC is hoping this perk \u2014 along with a commitment to provide two years of Android updates \u2014 will be enough to convince consumers that the new One is worth a look.", "494": "After months of leaks, HTC has officially announced its worst-kept secret in the new HTC One flagship for 2014. The new One uses more aluminum and features a 5-inch display with full HD resolution and also features a two-camera design that lets users create 3D images and add additional effects after the image has been taken, with the main camera using the same 4-ultrapixel configuration as last year\u2019s device, adding a dual-LED flash, newly upgraded ImageChip DSP, and increases the user-facing camera resolution from 2.0 megapixels to 5.0 megapixels.\n\nThe camera also features an improved Zoe capture mode, HDR mode, the ability to take images using both cameras at the same time, as well as the ability to save camera presets for later use. The One is powered by a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, which is accompanied by 2GB of RAM. The device will be offered with 32GB of storage in the U.S. and will support microSD cards up to 128GB in size. Despite the increased aluminum content in the bodyshell design, the new One includes support for NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and support for U.S. LTE networks.\n\nIn addition to the hardware updates, HTC officially revealed Sense 6.0, its latest update to its long-time user interface overlay. The new version of Sense makes it easier to add content to the Blinkfeed and manage home screens; adds lock-screen gestures that anticipate what the user will want or need; simplifies the camera software for video and still images; and features improved TV guide/remote software.\n\nHTC also claims the battery is 40% larger than the unit in last year\u2019s phone, and it comes with an \u201cextreme power saving\u201d mode, which shuts down all but the most essential apps when the battery reaches 5% and still provides for another 15 hours of battery life, according to HTC.\n\nAlong with the new One, HTC announced the companion Dot View case, which is a wrap-around case for the One. The front of the case is speckled with dots and using the case puts the phone into an alternate notification mode that will use the dots to display notifications for incoming calls and text messages. The Dot View cast will be available separately for $50.", "495": "HTC has unveiled its latest flagship phone, the HTC One (M8), which is set to hit UAE stores in the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe previous version, the HTC One (M7), was the Taiwanese company\u2019s most successful phone to date, winning a host of awards including best phone of the year at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud of the fact we have created such a great phone and we have evolved the features and made them better,\u201d said Graham Wheeler, the director of commercialisation product management at HTC.\n\nThe new flagship has a 5-inch display and incorporates a gesture-based system using finger taps instead of buttons for commands. It also has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera to take clear \u201cselfies\u201d.\n\nThe manufacturer is looking to recreate the same level of popularity with the launch of three different colours, one in \u201camber gold\u201d not too dissimilar from the iPhone 5S gold.\n\n\u201cIn the recent past, HTC has not been considered the device of choice as the product line up has been reduced, leaving just a few models in the range,\u201d said Angela Rangel, the research director of systems and infrastructure solutions at IDC. \u201cIts current price point together with a limited investment in marketing has cause the product [HTC One M7] not to enjoy the success it deserves.\u201d\n\nIssues with supply chain and distribution also hindered sales of the M7 and as a result, HTC\u2019s market share for smartphones fell from 3.9 per cent in 2010 to 1.7 per cent last year in the Middle East, according to IDC amid stiff competition from Samsung, Apple and cheaper Chinese brands such as Lenovo and Huawei.\n\nSamsung currently has a 49.9 per cent share of the smartphone market in the UAE and 57.3 per cent share in the Middle East.\n\nthamid@thenational.ae\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights", "496": "Share\n\nWe all knew it was coming, and we already know a lot about it \u2013 but in an interesting twist on the \u201cofficially announce it, and then wait a couple of weeks\u201d we\u2019re used to with new phones, the HTC One (M8) \u2013 a refreshed version of HTC\u2019s flagship handset is apparently now available in six Carphone Warehouse stores\u2026 having been driven straight from the venue where they announced it.\n\nThe six stores are at Westfield Stratford, Westfield White City, Oxford Circus and Centre Point (down the bottom of Tottenham Court Road). By my reckoning, that makes the White City the closest store to the official launch at Kensington Olympia, and likely the first to get the handsets, if you can\u2019t wait an extra fifteen minutes this afternoon.\n\nIn a made-up quote in the press release, an unknown spokesperson claims to have said \u201cCarphone Warehouse is proud to be one of the first to have the new HTC handset in our stores and offer the latest tech to customers as soon as it\u2019s announced.\u201d \u2013 because everyone knows that it is the best sort of \u2018proud\u2019 when you can achieve it using money alone.\n\nThe phone itself isn\u2019t going to be exactly revolutionary \u2013 but it is a nice incremental upgrade on last year\u2019s HTC One, sporting a quad-core 2.3ghz Snapdragon CPU, a 5 megapixel front-facing camera (for selfies), and an increase to a 5 inch screen. Perhaps the most intriguing feature is that there\u2019s two rear facing cameras. Speculation is that this is to take either 3D photos, or to enhance normal photos. I guess we\u2019ll find out in a few hours.\n\nThe phone will be available \u2013 from today at these stores \u2013 for \u00a342/month with no upfront costs, or \u00a3549.95 if you go for a SIM free version.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPrint\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "497": "HTC's One smartphone launched this time last year to rave reviews and was the \"most awarded smartphone\" of 2013. And rightly so. It was beautifully designed and built, had a great screen and powerful performance.\n\nThat is failed to stem HTC's falling revenues will be of huge worry to the Taiwanese company. On the opposite side of the fence is Apple, whose iPhone 5s may look a lot like its previous version but which has sold in the millions none-the-less.\n\nSo, can the all-new HTC One do more than just win awards, and really begin to challenge the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S5 for dominance in the smartphone market?\n\nLet's find out:\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Screen\n\nHTC has decided to increased the size of the One's screen by 0.3in, now measuring 5in diagonally. It retains the Full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, but the increase in size means pixel density has dropped slightly to 440 pixels per inch (ppi) from 468ppi last year - though this shouldn't impact on quality too much, if at all.\n\nApple on the other hand continues to resist the lure of the bigger screen (until the launch of the iPhone 6 at least) and the iPhone 5s retains the same 4in Retina Display as the iPhone 5. Yes it looks great, but compared to the HTC One, and practically every other premium smartphone these days, it looks puny.\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Design\n\nHTC won many admirers for the design of the HTC One last year, with most pointing to the use of premium materials like aluminium and glass over the plastic used by Samsung in its Galaxy devices. HTC has decided not to tinker much with a winning formula, and while the overall footprint of the phone has increased, HTC has made the edges more curved to make it feel more comfortable when holding it.\n\nBoth the HTC One (M8) and the iPhone 5s are available in gold, silver and grey.\n\nThe iPhone 5s may be petite but its iconic design and flawless build quality shine through. It feels great when you hold it and while the small screen may be a problem in some respects, ut it does mean one-handed use is much easier than the 2014 model of the HTC One.\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Hardware\n\nThe M8 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 SoC which features a quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz and an Adreno 330 GPU, all paired with 2GB of RAM. Early benchmarks show this should be a powerhouse of a phone. The M8 also continues to feature the front-facing BoomSound speakers, which should mean it remains as the best-sound smartphone on the market, but failed to include the fingerprint sensor features on the HTC One Max.\n\nIn terms of storage, the phone comes in 16GB or 32GB models, with that all-important microSD card slot for expansion.\n\nApple's iPhone 5s was (and remains) the only smarpthone on the market with a 64-bit processor meaning it is plenty powerful and once more apps are tuned to use it properly should help with battery life too. The A7 chip is joined by the M7 motion co-processor to allow it to constantly track your movements \u2013 for use with fitness apps.\n\nApple has also introduced its Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s, to unlock the phone with your fingers as well as make purchases from the App Store.\n\nWhile Apple does offer three storage options (16GB/32GB/64GB) there is no microSD card slot.\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Software\n\nThe all-new HTC One features the latest version of Google's operating system, Android 4.4.2 (KitKat), which is great, but HTC has sought to augment this with its own updated software, Sense 6.0.\n\nBlinkFeed, HTC's feed aggregation service remains as the default homepage, but the big new addition is gestures, including double-tap to wake, swipe left to launch widgets, swipe up to unlock and using the volume button to launch the camera.\n\nApple of course launched the completely redesigned iOS 7 on the iPhone 5s, and as you would expect the flatter, cleaner OS works flawlessly. While Android remains more open, iOS 7 still offers a better catalogue of quality app in the App Store.\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Camera\n\nHTC will be hoping its Duo Camera will be one of the big selling points for the 2014 version of the HTC One.\n\nThe new camera system features two camera sensors, one of which will be used to measure depth, to allow for easier creation of so-called 'bokeh' effects. We will have to wait and see if this is just a gimmick or a real benefit for amateur photographers. HTC has also included a dual-LED flash similar to the one on the iPhone 5s to improve low-light images.\n\nThe iPhone 5s also includes a slo-mo mode, a 15% bigger sensor and wider lens which allows in 25% more light (than the iPhone 5) all of which means Apple's camera is good \u2013 but it may now be behind the Galaxy S4 in terms of power of not the HTC One (M8).\n\nHTC One (M8) vs iPhone 5s: Which Should I Buy?\n\nAs always this comes down to personal choice and as both are priced in the \u00a3500+ category, the choice will mostly depend on features.\n\nIf you like you phones big and powerful and don't mind HTC's Sense interface, the all-new HTC One will be the choice for you.\n\nIf you prefer Apple's sleeker design and one-hand friendly 4in screen, along with a vast array of quality apps, then the iPhone 5s is for you.", "498": "Jacob Kleinman | Internet Tips Tricks & News by\n\nGoogle\u2019s predictive digital assistant, Google Now, is about to invade your computer.

Most people probably don't even realize Desktop Chrome has a notification panel, and putting Google Now cards there seems like a great way for no one to ever notice them. Chrome's Notification Panel icon shows up as a tiny bell in the system tray on Windows or the Menu bar in Mac OS, and clicking it opens the panel. Google Now cards silently appear behind this icon\u2014there is no popup message, sound, or any other notification that a card is available. We suspect that many users ignore the little bell as \"just another tray icon,\" and as a result, most users won't see any Google Now cards. We were hoping for something in a more prominent position, like on the new tab page, on Google.com, or anywhere in the actual UI of Chrome. Desktop Google Now also isn't a standalone product\u2014it requires that the user have an Android or iOS phone in order to work.\n\nStill, after two months of testing and no interface changes, Google seems happy with the design. The company says the rollout is starting today and will finish over the next few weeks.

It packs two of the company's top-end GK110 GPUs onto a single board - the same chip that powers Titan Black, the fastest single GPU graphics card on the market today.\n\nWe're looking at a mammoth 12GB of GDDR5 memory (6GB per GPU) married up with a total of 5760 CUDA cores - 2880 per chip. It's unclear right now exactly how fast the chips run: Nvidia's last dual-GPU product - the GeForce GTX 690 married up two GTX 680s onto a single board, but saw clock-speeds reduced in order to fit within a reasonable power/heat profile. Nvidia says that the Titan Z is rated at eight teraflops, while a single Titan Black ranks at 5.1TF, strongly suggestive of a downclock. However, while Nvidia isn't talking clock-speeds, it is known that the Titan Z uses the fastest 7GHz GDDR5 the firm has available.\n\nNvidia talks up Titan Z as \"engineered for next-generation 5K and multi-monitor gaming\" but the astonishingly high price-point suggests that even the most affluent gamers may be better served by buying two existing GK110 products (GTX 780, 780 Ti, Titan, Titan Black) and running them in SLI. Instead, we suspect that Titan Z better serves the compute market, where cramming as many high-end GPUs into a PC as possible has a real tangible benefit - a sentiment expressed by Nvidia big cheese Jen-Hsun in this Nvidia blog post.\n\nWarrior robot in disguise? No, it's a CG animation based on the new Titan Z graphics card with its all-new cooling arrangement.\n\nTitan Z appears to be the last hurrah for the company's Kepler line and with Maxwell now in production, Nvidia used its GTC keynote to reveal its plans for 2016. A new architecture - dubbed Pascal - is en route, offering two revolutionary technologies that will see GPU power continue to follow the relentless pace laid down by Moore's Law. NvLink seeks to eliminate the bottleneck between CPU and GPU via a new interconnect with 5x to 12x the bandwidth of the current PCI Express standard, also offering a 5x increase in available bandwidth for multi-GPU set-ups. The second innovation is stacked memory chips, which should offer a huge increase in memory throughput (few specifics were revealed today).\n\nBefore Pascal arrives, we'll see more from the Maxwell line in the form of more powerful iterations of Nvidia's successful GeForce GTX 750 Ti, with the architecture also forming the basis for the follow-up to the recently revealed Tegra K1 mobile chip.", "502": "SAN JOSE, USA: NVIDIA announced that it plans to integrate a high-speed interconnect, called NVIDIA NVLink, into its future GPUs, enabling GPUs and CPUs to share data five to 12 times faster than they can today.\n\nThis will eliminate a longstanding bottleneck and help pave the way for a new generation of exascale supercomputers that are 50-100 times faster than today\u2019s most powerful systems.\n\nNVIDIA will add NVLink technology into its Pascal GPU architecture \u2014 expected to be introduced in 2016 \u2014 following this year\u2019s new NVIDIA Maxwell compute architecture.

At the GPU Technology Conference today, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unwrapped the GeForce GTX Titan Z, a preposterously fast (and expensive) card featuring not one, but two GK110 graphics processors. Our own Scott Wasson was on the scene, but since he's marooned without Wi-Fi connectivity, allow me to do the honors.\n\nThe GeForce GTX Titan Z's GK110 GPUs are the same, full-fat chips featured in the new GTX Titan Black. That means the Titan Z has a total of 5,760 stream processors. Nvidia hasn't announced speeds yet, but it does say the dual GK110 GPUs are \"tuned to run at the same clock speed.\" Oh, and the Titan Z has 12 gigs of RAM\u2014you know, in case you need to drive a display array the size of Jupiter.\n\nInterestingly, despite the powerful hardware under the hood, Nvidia claims it's managed to keep the Titan Z \"cool and quiet.\" There's talk of \"dynamic power balancing\" and \"low-profile components and ducted baseplate channels\" in the company's announcement. More importantly, Scott says the Titan Z card Huang held up looked to have a triple-slot cooler. I'd imagine the extra heatsink surface area would help quite a bit with heat dissipation.\n\nNvidia expects to price the GeForce GTX Titan Z at $2,999, a cool 50% premium over the price of dual Titan Blacks.

Pascal, according to NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. That's the name of the company's next-generation GPU, and Huang says it'll be smaller, faster and more efficient, naturally. \"As we compute more, we have to move more data around,\" he said, speaking at NVIDIA's GPU technology conference in San Jose today. \"It's the data bottleneck.\" He's talking about how the speed at which data is exchanged between the CPU and GPU limits the processor's ability to perform. He's also talking about how NVIDIA hopes to solve the issue, introducing NVLink, a chip-to-chip communication technology (a new socket) that promises to outpace PCIe communication speeds by a factor of five (but up to 12). The company says the PCIe standard probably isn't going away, but is confident that its dedicated GPU socket will allow it to leapfrog existing bottlenecks.

REUTERS/St Croix Sherriff/Handout (UNITED STATES - Tags: TRANSPORT CRIME LAW BUSINESS POLITICS) ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. IT IS DISTRIBUTED, EXACTLY AS RECEIVED BY REUTERS, AS A SERVICE TO CLIENTS. FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR SALE FOR MARKETING OR ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS\n\nWe\u2019re getting a better understanding of what drove General Motors (GM) to bankruptcy in 2009.\n\nNewly unearthed legal documents show GM knew about faulty ignition switches on the Chevrolet Cobalt and other vehicles before it even began selling the models in 2004. It launched the vehicles anyway, figuring owners would be able to get off the road safely if the car shut down during travel. GM made \u201ca business decision not to fix this problem,\u201d a company engineer explained under oath in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal, as part of a lawsuit involving a Georgia woman who died in a Cobalt that shut down at highway speeds and crashed.\n\nFor a moment, put aside the obvious safety problem of cars shutting down on the highway, and think only of a flaw that might make your car inoperable. GM was already in a tailspin in 2004, losing market share to Japanese rivals and getting pummeled by auto critics for the shoddy quality of its vehicles \u2014 small cars especially. GM promoted the new Cobalt as an import slayer, on par with standard-bearers such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.\n\nMost critics didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cNot all that impressive,\u201d Consumer Reports declared of the Cobalt, dinging the car for flabby steering, uncomfortable seats, gappy interior panels and other shortcomings. \u201cIt\u2019s more fulfilling as a rental than as a car you\u2019d buy.\u201d If only they had known.\n\nNow for the safety bit. As part of the 2013 lawsuit, GM officials suggested the Cobalt could be safely brought to rest if the ignition switch failed and the key inadvertently slipped from \u201con\u201d to \u201coff.\u201d Too bad they didn\u2019t put that in the sales brochure. \u201cJust coast to a pleasing halt!\u201d Chevy could have enticed buyers. You can imagine the emergency meetings at Honda and Toyota as they pondered whether to copy this groundbreaking, surprise-shutdown feature.\n\nCulturally rotten\n\nWhat still isn\u2019t known is how high up at GM the decision to send deeply flawed vehicles onto American roads went. But something is culturally rotten at a company if mid-level managers responsible for safety can rationalize away something as severe as a high-speed shutdown. Nobody up the chain is telling them quality is crucial. What the bosses probably are saying is, keep costs down, no matter what. Such contempt for customers often leads straight to the corporate graveyard. Come to think of it, that's exactly what happened to GM.\n\nThe automaker says the faulty switches have now been linked to 31 crashes involving 12 deaths, and an unknown number of injuries. So far, the company has recalled 1.6 million vehicles with the problem. Several federal investigations are underway and the automaker or certain executives could face criminal charges.\n\nAll this happened at the \u201cold GM,\u201d before bankruptcy, and the automaker is genuinely a different company now. GM has had four CEOs since the last of the deadly ignition switches rolled off the line. The current chief, Mary Barra, worked at GM at the time but says she was never involved with the tainted vehicles and didn\u2019t know of the problem until this year. Meanwhile, GM is finally building world-class vehicles in nearly every category, rather than laughingstock passenger cars meant to fill dealerships and give customers something else to look at when they come in to check out a truck or SUV.\n\nBut will consumers buy it? Will they really differentiate between two different GMs separated by a bankruptcy filing? That seems doubtful. GM is only part of the way through the rehabilitation of its brand, convincing some new buyers to try a GM product but still failing to connect with many others, including some permanently disgusted by the automaker\u2019s 2009 federal bailout.\n\nGM may be able to limit its legal payouts to some plaintiffs, since the bankruptcy filing provides a liability shield for incidents that occurred before July 10, 2009. That liability resides with the old GM \u2014 the entity responsible for leftover debts from the pre-bankruptcy days \u2014 which is almost out of money. But invoking that technicality could cost GM a lot more in bad publicity \u2014 and lost future sales \u2014 than it saves in legal payouts.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.) has now joined safety advocates in calling on GM to establish a fund to compensate victims and their families, regardless of whether the liability shield legally absolves the company. GM, now handsomely profitable, can probably afford such a fund. \u201cEven if GM said we\u2019re going to pay out several billion dollars, it would hardly move the needle in my fair-value estimate,\u201d says David Whiston, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cI\u2019m still very bullish on the stock.\u201d Investors seem to agree: GM stock has dipped since it first announced the recall in early January, but it hasn\u2019t cratered the way, say, BP\u2019s (BP) stock did after the disastrous Gulf oil spill in 2010.\n\nStory continues", "507": "General Motors was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit last week, believed to be the first over ignition switch problems since the automaker's massive recall of 1.6 million vehicles back in February.\n\nA lawsuit was filed on March 21 in Minnesota state court on behalf of three teenage girls who were involved in a 2006 crash while riding in a 2005 Chevy Cobalt.\n\nThe vehicle is one of the many models GM recalled over ignition problems earlier this year.\n\nDespite learning of the ignition issues back in 2001, and releasing related service bulletins to dealers suggesting remedies in 2005, GM waited until February to announce a recall.\n\nSince word got out regarding how long the automaker knew about the issue, GM has since apologized for how it handled the recall.\n\nTo no surprise, the lawsuit accuses GM of knowing about the defect for over decade, but failing to take action to try fixing affected vehicles.\n\n\"GM hid this dangerous, life-threatening defect from my clients and all other Cobalt drivers for over a decade just to avoid the cost of a recall,\" said a lawyer for the families, Robert Hilliard of Hilliard Munoz Gonzales, in a statement, according to Reuters. \"GM is guilty of betraying our trust.\"\n\nGM spokesman, Jim Cain, said the company is working on a formal response to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Right now, our biggest focus is on getting these vehicles recalled as quickly as we can with as little inconvenience to customers as possible,\" said Cain.\n\nThe Chevy Cobalt's ignition switch suddenly turned from the \"Run\" to \"Accessory\" position, causing the braking, airbag, and steering systems to suddenly lose power.\n\nThe driver, 19-year-old Megan Phillips, then lost control of the vehicle, which went off the road and hit a telephone junction box and two trees, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAs a result, Amy Rademaker, 15, and Natasha Weigel, 18, were both killed and Phillips sustained severe injuries to her brain and body.\n\nThe family members of Rademaker and Weigel, as well as Phillips, are looking for over $50,000 from GM, according to Hilliard.\n\nThe 2006 accident took place before GM's bankruptcy filing back in 2009.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"new GM,\" is not responsible under the terms of its bankruptcy exit for incidents or crashes that took place before July 2009, according to Reuters.\n\nClaims must be brought against the pre-bankruptcy company, not the current one, according to GM.\n\nRegardless, the lawsuit still names the \"new\" GM as a defendant.\n\nGM has been hit with at around five proposed class actions by customers who say their vehicles lost value.\n\nThe automaker received reports of approximately 12 deaths and 34 crashes involving recalled vehicles.", "508": "General Motors Co. engineering managers knew about ignition-switch problems on the 2005 Cobalt that could disable power steering, power brakes and air bags, but launched the car anyway, according to court documents uncovered by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe company believed the vehicles could be safely coasted off the road after a stall, according to testimony from a GM engineer in one of dozens of civil suits against the automaker because of deaths related to the fault.\n\nGM was forced to recall 1.6 million vehicles, many of them Cobalts, earlier this year because of a fault that turns off the ignition switch while the car is being driven. Also recalled were Saturn Ion, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Pontiac G5 and Saturn Sky.\n\nAn estimated 12 deaths and 34 accidents are related to the ignition switch problem.\n\nDifficult to steer\n\nThe lawsuit related to a fatal crash in which the victim was driving her Cobalt at around 80 km/h when the ignition failed and airbags failed to deploy because the car was turned off at the time of crash.\n\nOthers who were involved in similar accidents reported to the National Vehicle Safety Administration that the car was difficult, if not impossible to steer, under these circumstances.\n\nBut during the 2013 court case, an engineer testified that GM believed drivers should be able to handle the car without power steering.\n\nIn further bad news over GM's handling of the defect, Automotive News is reporting that GM re-engineered the faulty ignition on the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion in 2006, but failed to create a new part number for it, a cardinal sin in the auto business.\n\nThe auto industry keeps detailed information on each part, including a new part number for each redesign. Not following this protocol helped stall its own engineers\u2019 investigation into problems with the cars, the trade publication said.\n\nGM did however issue service bulletins to its dealers about problems with the Cobalt as early as 2005.\n\nIn a meeting on May 15, 2009, GM engineers learned that data in the black boxes of Chevrolet Cobalts confirmed a potentially fatal defect existed in hundreds of thousands of cars.\n\nGM denied problems\n\nBut in the months and years that followed, GM told the families of accident victims and other customers that it did not have evidence of any defect in their cars, interviews, letters and legal documents show.\n\nAuto companies are subject to a law that makes it a crime to mislead U.S. safety regulators.\n\nThe U.S. government is investigating General Motors' handling of the defect and probing reports that it knew there was a problem for years.\n\nAfter levying a $1.2-billion fine on Toyota last month over an unreported safety problem with its accelerator pedals, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he expected that settlement to serve as a model for how prosecutors would approach future cases involving \"similarly situated companies.\"\n\nAlthough the Japanese automaker faces a large fine, criminal prosecution of individuals involved is not likely.\n\nSince it announced the recall, GM has faced a number of private lawsuits, as well as class actions by auto owners who say the recall affected the value of their vehicles.\n\nA wrongful death lawsuit was filed in Minnesota recently on behalf of three teenaged girls who were injured or killed in a 2006 crash. The lawsuit accuses GM of knowing about the ignition switch defect, but failing to fix the vehicles.\n\nIn two private lawsuits in Texas, the plaintiffs urge GM to tell owners of affected Saturn and Cobalt cars not to drive the cars.\n\nA U.S. senator on Monday asked the federal government to force General Motors to establish a fund to compensate consumers affected by the problem.", "509": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former employee of Delphi Automotive has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit claiming General Motors Co concealed a faulty ignition switch that was responsible for a crash that killed his daughter.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by Steve Smith in Alabama state court on Monday, and names GM as a defendant, as well as Delphi, which supplied the ignition switch to GM.\n\nGM recalled 1.6 million vehicles in February, despite learning of problems with the ignition switch as early as 2001 and issuing related service bulletins to dealers with suggested remedies in 2005. GM has linked the ignition switch problems to 12 deaths. The company has apologized for how it handled the recall.\n\nA spokesman for GM, Jim Cain, declined to comment on the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Delphi did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Smith\u2019s daughter, Aubrey Wallace Williams, was driving a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt on a highway in Alabama when the ignition switch failed, causing the engine to shut off and turning off power in the vehicle. The car became uncontrollable and crossed into a different lane where it struck an 18-wheeler truck, the complaint said. Williams was killed instantly, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit did not specify how much Smith is seeking in damages. It said that GM and Delphi knew about the ignition switch problem but failed to take steps to address it, resulting in Williams\u2019 death.\n\nThe automaker has said it is moving as fast as it can to repair vehicles with the faulty ignition switches.\n\nSmith retired about three years ago. He did not design, work on or have any other involvement with the ignition switch, according to his lawyer, Jere Beasley, of the firm Beasley Allen.\n\nGM has faced a growing number of lawsuits since the recall was announced.

It's the reason that Facebook is freaking out so much over it's \"teen problem.\"\n\nThere is no more competitive space right now, though, than music streaming. So, in a move designed to collect a bunch of new, young users and keep them, hopefully forever, Spotify has decided to cut the price of its Premium service in half for college students.\n\nUsers who sign up for Spotify's Premium service not only get ad-free listening, but higher quality audio and the ability to get on-demand access to any song via mobile. For non-Premium users, they only get a Pandora-like radio service when on the go.\n\nRather than paying $10 a month for these features, as everyone else has to, students who are currently enrolled in accredited U.S. universities will only have to pay $5. Any student who is already a Premium member cannot get a discount for the current month, but they can register for the discount so that it will be applied on the next renewal date of their current subscription.\n\nSpotify is using verification service SheerID to make sure that people who try to get the discount are actually enrolled in a college, and not attempting to take advantage of a discount they don't qualify for.\n\nThis is not the first time that Spotify has offered a similar deal to student: it introduced a similar discount to U.K. students in 2012.\n\n\n\nWhile Spotify is one of the biggest companies in the music streaming space, it has a lot of catching up to if it wants to truly compete with Pandora. Spotify currently has over 24 million active users, but only a quarter, six million, are paying subscribers. Pandora, on the other hand, has more than 250 million registered users.\n\nSpotify has to be hoping it can close that gap, at least a little bit, with this latest move.\n\nThere are nearly 17.5 million currently enrolled students in the United States. Even if only a quarter of those students sign up, it would net Spotify an extra $22 million in revenue and give them over four million new users.\n\nSince its launch in 2008, Spotify says it\u2019s driven more than $1 billion to rights holders. it currently has over 20 million songs, with over 20,000 being added every day. It is available in 55 markets, including Austria, Iceland, Belgium, Bolivia, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Argentina, Nicaragua, Australia, Malaysia and Taiwan.\n\nIn November of last year, Spotify raised $250 million in new funding at a $4 billion valuation. That brought the company's total funding to $538 million.\n\n(Image source: blog.ck12.org)", "518": "Kim and Kanye are planning an extravagant wedding set for May 24, in France and HollywoodLife.com has gotten our hands on their A-list guest list.

She also debunked reports that Kanye \u201cbegged\u201d her to put Kim on the cover.\n\n\u201cHe did nothing of the sort,\u201d Anna writes. \u201cThe gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cKanye is an amazing performer and cultural provocateur, while Kim, through her strength of character, has created a place for herself in the glare of the world\u2019s spotlight, and it takes real guts to do that. I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T.

And when you get a Vogue cover, it's a build in your career... a stepping stone to achieve that.\"\n\nThe hosts tried to pry more information out of her by saying, \"Kim and Kanye haven't earned the right to be on the cover of Vogue?\"\n\n\"Those are your words-not mine. I'm being politically correct,\" she responded.\n\nBut she didn't need to say much more. It's obvious that Campbell is not a fan of the cover, which is understandable. It wasn't too long ago when models were frequently featured on the front of glossies. Nowadays, celebrities are mostly on the cover.\n\nIt's not just Campbell who disapproves of the cover. Plenty of people took to social media to express their disappointment.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar, for example, tweeted, \"Well......I guess I'm canceling my Vogue subscription. Who is with me???\"\n\nSome people even claimed that Anna Wintour was over for allowing Kanye West to get his way. In her editor's letter, she said that West did not campaign for the cover and that she chose the couple because of their influence. And because they can \"define the culture at any given moment\" and their \"presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 Latin One.

Even subscribers to Vogue, which released its April cover Friday featuring Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, seemed a little shocked at their own responses.\n\nArguments reverberating around the Internet over the last few days have largely focused on this central question: Does Kim Kardashian deserve to be on the cover of Vogue?\n\n\n\nThis cover image taken by Annie Leibovitz for Vogue shows the April 2014 issue of the high fashion magazine featuring rapper Kanye West and TV personality Kim Kardashian. (AP Photo/Vogue, Annie Leibovitz)\n\nAnna Wintour helped redefine the notion of a cover model during her tenure with the century-old publication. The former editor in chief and current artistic director at Conde Nast led the transition from super models, who monopolized the front slots through the eighties and nineties, to celebrity images on the cover. What began as a sprinkling of starlets over the past two decades became a permanent shift in the early 2000s, and the Lauren Huttons, Giseles and Kate Mosses of the world were relegated to inside spreads.\n\nMost of the women featured (Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Charlize Theron, Penelope Cruz, etc.) were actresses or \u2018it\u2019 girls nearly interchangeable with the models they displaced. However, the transition from models to actresses underscored the idea that the cover model role was significant \u2013an acknowledgement of accomplishments ranging from break-out roles to notable awards.\n\nThe selection of Oprah Winfrey and Hillary Rodham Clinton as cover subjects (October and December of 1998, respectively), cemented the idea that the position was one of honor. A Vogue cover celebrated women with poise and confidence who had made a contribution, if not to the world of fashion, then to the world at large.\n\nThat\u2019s the largest fault that long-time subscribers have found in the choice of a reality star and her rapper fiance. For all of the Sienna Miller and Blake Lively covers (who fill more of the waif super model position than role model) Vogue has also featured first ladies, Grammy winners and Meryl Streep.\n\nYet, Miller has been nominated for two BAFTAs and a Golden Globe, and Lively has a half-dozen film roles and a fashion-focused TV show under her belt \u2014 accomplishments that encompass a palatable sense of worthiness for Vogue to push to readers.\n\nDoes a reality TV show and an impressive social media following rise to this bar? Is Vogue telling people that a sex tape and a gig with E! are desirable goals for young women? For better or worse, many commenters on Vogue\u2019s platforms have expressed that these merits do not fit with their sensibilities.\n\nAnother area of debate has centered on whether \u201cVogue-worthiness\u201d is dependent on ethnicity and size. Vogue, like much of the fashion industry, has been criticized for a long-standing lack of diversity and a reliance on white, willowy women to sell magazines. Is the West/Kardashian cover \u2014 a month after Rihanna graced the cover \u2014 at all an acknowledgment that the pale waif is an outdated standard of beauty? One should hope.\n\nBut if the point was in part to diversify, why not look to more obvious choices, such as Kerry Washington, Lupita Neyong\u2019o and Mindy Kaling, who haven\u2019t yet been Vogue cover models. Washington has even been the center of media campaigns for a cover.\n\nWest, too, has waged a cover campaign of sorts and that may be the ultimate point of contention for Vogue loyalists. Like a vice presidential bid, one does not openly lobby for a major cover. Even more gauche, allowing your significant other to do it for you.\n\nWest has admittedly pushed Kardashian into the world of high fashion \u2014 cleaning out her closet, introducing her to his stylists and friend Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy, and ensuring her presence at the 2013 Met Gala. He has also been on a public campaign for the fashion industry to take her more seriously, calling her the \u201cthe most intriguing woman right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian attends The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute benefit celebrating \u201cPUNK: Chaos to Couture\u201d in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File)\n\nWest followed that statement, which he made on the show On Air With Ryan Seacrest, by saying \u201cShe\u2019s got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday \u2026 and collectively we\u2019re the most influential with clothing. No one is looking at what [President] Obama is wearing. Michelle Obama cannot Instagram a [bikini] pic like what my girl Instagrammed the other day.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Wintour caved to West\u2019s pressure, which she states she did not in the April editor\u2019s letter, is beside the point. Kardashian has relied on West and their collective money-making prowess to advance her status in the fashion ranks, a cardinal sin of the industry.\n\nThe topic is apropos in the wake of L\u2019Wren Scott\u2019s death last week. As critic Robin Givhan noted, one of Seventh Avenue\u2019s most enduring prejudices is celebrity, and Scott was afflicted with the curse of reflected glory for being Mick Jagger\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nThat hindrance seemed to make Scott work even harder in her career. She ultimately produced desirable clothing and dressed some of Hollywood\u2019s most prominent women, earning her spot as a respected designer and stylist.\n\nFor a woman to rest on her fiance\u2019s ambition and connections, and still make it to one of the most coveted spots in pop culture is the insult to injury for those who expect more from the \u2018fashion Bible.\u2019\n\nKim Kardashian, Kanye West are the world\u2019s most talked about couple.

Some days it\u2019s a woman famous for being famous. Some days it\u2019s a woman famous for hitting her secretaries.\n\nAs for the current outrage over the Kim and Kanye cover \u2014 it\u2019s like we\u2019re all celebrating alliteration, isn\u2019t it? \u2014 keep in mind that there was just as big a brouhaha when Madonna was on the cover of Vogue in 1989.

In 2008, a Vogue cover featuring Gisele Bundchen and LeBron James was compared to an old King Kong poster and charitably described as \u2018racially insensitive.\u2019\n\nAnd this year, some people were unhappy to see Lena Dunham on the cover.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can put \u2018Vogue\u2019 and \u2018zeitgeist\u2019 in the same sentence as often as you like and hope the magazine reflects some sort of social leading edge, but you\u2019d be kidding yourself. Anna Wintour, defending her new cover, says one of the cool things about her job is, \"Being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it.\" If she means Kim and Kanye, she should have said that three years ago.\n\nFashion magazines such as Vogue are part of a bigger picture involving advertising and sales (among other things) that aim to make women feel bad. Consider the billion dollar weight-loss industry, the uptick in plastic surgery or the creation of hundreds of useless products \u2014 from vaginal perfume to girdle underwear \u2014 that are all part of the machinery working to convince women they can buy or starve or consume their way to a feeling of self-worth.\n\nSo, in the space of a week: Sad that L\u2019Wren Scott\u2019s ambition wasn\u2019t realized.\n\nGlad that Kim Kardashian had her dream come true.\n\nWish we didn\u2019t have to look at either side of that coin ever again.\n\nTwitter: @LizBraunSun\n\nLiz.braun@sunmedia.ca", "523": "Supermodel shade!

Joe 3 and Fast & Furious 7.\n\nIGN was among the select press outlets invited to chat with actor Dwayne Johnson on Monday at CinemaCon about his new movie Hercules, during which time The Rock was also asked about those nagging rumors of him playing the John Stewart Green Lantern for DC and Warner Bros.\n\nHere's what Johnson had to say about that, returning to Fast & Furious 7 after the death of Paul Walker, and his other future projects.\n\nQuestion: Where are you heading as an actor as far as what you want to do next and where you want to go? Do have other projects you want to start doing?\n\nJohnson: Yeah, sure. The whole idea is just to continue to make movies that I enjoy playing and that audiences are going to enjoy me in. So franchises are always fun, because they're big, and a lot of people like to go and escape and have fun with them. There are some serious roles too -- Not Without Hope, for example. Television too; I've been enjoying that. Creating things I think, especially as an actor -- wanting to bring to the table things that have never been done before, but also making sure they're of high quality and not having a fear. For example, if we're going to do something with TV or cable -- like at TNT, with Wake Up Call -- I didn't want to play by what rules are in Hollywood, so to speak. \"I'm not too sure if you should do that at a cable network or not.\" Didn't matter to me. So we did that; it was an HBO show that we had. There's a lot of different things like that. So our whole idea is just to put out quality on a lot of different levels.\n\nQuestion: You've become part of the family in the Fast & Furious films -- I think \"family\" is exactly the right word for those movies. How does a family move on with the loss of one of the major members of it?\n\nJohnson: Well, as best you can. You know, we've all dealt with that kind of loss before, where it jolts us and it jolts our hearts. I think it also has a way of informing us. Loss like that also has a way of making us love better, love stronger, appreciate our loved ones and our family that much more, when we wake up and when we go to bed. How families deal with loss, everyone has their own process. The biggest pain I felt was for his family, his daughter. You know, we had talked about that a multitude of times, how cool it is to be a dad; there's that really special bond between a dad and his little girl. She'll always be his little girl. We talked a lot about that. So my biggest pain was for his family and for his daughter, mom and dad. But as far as for the movie family that he had, it just takes time. You just need space, and space was created. The studio took a moment, took a beat, created a lot of space too. You know, you move forward one day at a time with it. As a family, they move forward one day at a time and get through it. Then I think the movie family and the studio and the movie itself, they move forward one day at a time too, and as respectfully as you can.\n\nQuestion: How important is it for you guys to really honor him with the next one and make sure that it's a fitting finale for that character?\n\nJohnson: It's very important for everybody involved, of course. It's not easy, and it's a challenge when you have something like this -- a beloved person. Paul, as you guys know, he was truly one of the good guys -- a great dude, who didn't take himself seriously, loved what he did, understood the business of the business. You got the real-deal, genuine guy when you got him. So it's important for everybody to creatively honor him in the best way that we possibly can.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nQuestion: Were you able to film a cameo as a G.I. Joe character in Transformers 4, because a lot people are waiting for G.I. Joe to meet Transformers?\n\nJohnson: [Laughs] No, no, I was not. We talked about it, but no, I didn't get a chance to.\n\nIGN's Jim Vejvoda: I've gotta ask -- you replied to a tweet of mine a few months ago.\n\nJohnson: I remember! Yeah, man.\n\nQuestion: Right, the John Stewart hashtag. What's up with that? What's going on there with the whole namedropping John Stewart thing? I'm curious.\n\nJohnson: I love John Stewart!\n\nQuestion: So let's address the green elephant in the room. Are you going to be Green Lantern?\n\nJohnson: [Laughs] Okay, well since you asked. We're all friends. So, you know, there's been mutual interest with myself and DC for many years to find the right character. I, like everyone here in the room, love superheroes. So there's been mutual interest with us for years, and we've been having ongoing discussions, myself and DC, for years about the right character, what the right character would be. That's another thing, too: it had to be right.\n\nQuestion: It was going to be Black Adam for awhile, right?\n\nJohnson: Well, here's the thing -- so we've been having these ongoing discussions. I won't tell you who it is, but I'll tell you the three qualities we're looking for, okay? This is going to be fun!\n\nQuestion: Does he wear a ring?\n\nJohnson: [Laughs] Can't say that, but here we go. Here are three qualities. The first quality we were looking for was that he had to be extremely complex and have a lot going on. What that does for me as an actor and the studio is it gives us space that we can explore; his complexities. The other quality was that he had to -- the character we were looking for had to be well-known but never brought to life. Then what that does again as an actor, it gives me a little bit of space, and we talked about personality. It just gives me a chance to put an imprint into his personality, with the set of tools that I could bring to the table and put a very unique twist on his personality, but still pay homage to who he is. The third thing -- and most important -- is he had to be a badass motherfucker, okay, and on a Superman level of power, where could throw down. In those three qualities, I'm happy we've found that character. Right now, we're out to a lot of writers.\n\nQuestion: Do you think maybe you'll be at Comic-Con saying for certain what it is?\n\nJohnson: Comic-Con or CinemaCon?\n\nQuestion: Comic-Con. We'll give you some time.\n\nJohnson: Yeah, I think time, man! We need to find a writer. When is that, June? July? Yeah, possibly. So how about that? He had to be well-known --\n\nQuestion: I have a question about this. This all sounds very cool. I think a lot of us have an idea of who it might be, but I'm definitely curious if this is a character that you could be cameoing in another franchise, or if this is something that you are doing on your own, with your own movie?\n\nJohnson: Possibly, but we haven't discussed that -- not you and I, but in terms of me and DC. [Laughs] But possibly, sure. You never know.\n\nQuestion: Have you guys talked about when another G.I. Joe might happen, because I know Jon Chu's doing some other things now.\n\nJohnson: Yeah, yeah. Well, the idea is that we would start shooting G.I. Joe in January, in the first quarter of next year. That's the idea. Look, I love Jon, and I think he did a great job. I get it. He had to go on and do something else. By the way, maybe...\n\nQuestion: He could still be done by then.\n\nJohnson: Could be, right?\n\nQuestion: What was it about San Andreas that got you in? Talk a little bit about the character you're playing.\n\nJohnson: Yeah, so I read the script when I was in Budapest, and I loved the script and the idea of being in a disaster movie that felt very real and very grounded, based of course on the San Andreas fault. I did a lot of research on the fault and sat down with geologists over in Budapest. We had a great meeting. So it felt very real and very grounded. The script came in -- by the Hayes Brothers, who wrote The Conjuring, and we're working on some other stuff together. They delivered a great script. Brad Peyton came in and flew to Budapest. We had a couple of directors fly out, but he came in -- not only because of the relationship I'd had with Brad from a movie that we did three or four years ago, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island -- but he came in and had an awesome take. Just visually and stylistically, I think what Brad's going to be able to do with an earthquake movie in 3D -- first 3D earthquake disaster movie ever filmed -- and the opportunity of playing a first responder in the LA fire department was exciting.\n\nQuestion: What kind of tone is it, because it's a huge earthquake movie?\n\nJohnson: Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. So the tone is very serious, and I'm going to save my daughter. We reveal some other things along the way that have happened. Again, it's interesting. Thematically, for me, the family, loss, going to take care of it.\n\n[Shows a picture to give a sense of the tone.]\n\nQuestion: Are you filming that right now, or filming soon?\n\nJohnson: Yeah, we're going to start filming in Australia. In about two weeks I leave. Then I'll come back. We'll wrap that, so all my stuff will be shot -- the first half of the schedule. Then I'll come back, and I'll see you guys again for the full-on promotion.\n\nQuestion: So do you guys have a G.I. Joe 3 director yet? Are you still looking?\n\nJohnson: We're still looking, yeah.", "527": "Earlier this year, the Kellan Lutz vehicle The Legend of Hercules thudded into theaters with 3 percent positive reviews and an $18.8 million gross on a $70 million budget.

But he did it for the greater good of the big reveal.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, not showing my chiseled, extraordinary, handsome face was a tremendous sacrifice for me,\u201d he joked on Monday before the premiere of the film\u2019s trailer at Las Vegas movie-theater convention CinemaCon.\n\n\u201cParamount, MGM and I made a pact,\u201d he added. \u201cWe wanted to make a massive global and entertaining movie while doing all we could to never reveal the actual look of Hercules.\u201d\n\nSlowly rolling out photos from the set of the film for the past few months via his Twitter page, Johnson aimed to bring fans along on his journey \u2014 from his training to his diet and prep.\n\nOn Sunday, the 41-year-old actor finally unveiled his \u201cHercules\u201d look in its entirety.\n\nVia Twitter, he posted a photo revealing his full beard, shoulder-length brown locks and armor. In the caption accompanying the photo he wrote: \u201cThe world\u2019s first superhero. #TilDeathOrVictory.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re offered hints of the Greek hero\u2019s abilities in the film\u2019s trailer, which debuts wide on Tuesday. In it, Hercules battles the multiheaded Lernaean hydra water monster, the behemoth Erymanthian boar and the massive Nemean lion. In the following clip he classically dons the skinned lion as a headpiece.\n\nBut, of course, Hercules is a multifaceted figure, so we\u2019re also treated to a brief snapshot of the hero absorbed in a tender lip-lock.\n\nThe teaser\u2019s conclusion takes us right back to the barbarousness, with the Greek hero fiercely yelling, \u201cI am Hercules!\u201d\n\nAt 6 feet 5 inches, the extremely muscular Johnson said he trained harder for \u201cHercules,\u201d which hits theaters July 25, than any other role. \u201cBut in the end,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was all well worth it.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Trailer for the Rock's Greek epic screened for attendees and press.\n\nThe Rock himself, Dwayne Johnson, was at CinemaCon today to promote his upcoming adventure epic Hercules wherein he plays the mythological hero. The new trailer, seen below, debuted online today, but Johnson screened it for IGN and other members of the invited press Monday at a Paramount Pictures brunch, during which time he also participated in a Q&A.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nBrett Ratner directs Hercules, which also stars Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Joseph Fiennes, Peter Mullan, John Hurt, and Rebecca Ferguson. The film is based on the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars. The official plot synopsis for the Paramount/MGM film follows:\n\n\"Everyone knows the legend of Hercules and his twelve labors. Our story begins after the labors, and after the legend\u2026Haunted by a sin from his past, Hercules has become a mercenary. Along with five faithful companions, he travels ancient Greece selling his services for gold and using his legendary reputation to intimidate enemies. But when the benevolent ruler of Thrace and his daughter seek Hercules' help to defeat a savage and terrifying warlord, Hercules finds that in order for good to triumph and justice to prevail... he must again become the hero he once was... he must embrace his own myth... he must be Hercules.\"\n\nHere's what Johnson had to tell us about making Hercules and more:\n\nQuestion: I'm very curious about the balance between playing it real versus fantasy. Is it like 300 exaggeration?\n\nDwayne Johnson: Well, there had been a few iterations in the past of Hercules. The idea was to take the spirit of the graphic novel, which we liked, and then create a script and a story based on that that still gave a very unique twist on the story of Hercules. But we also pay attention, respect and homage to the mythology of Hercules as it relates to the 12 Labors and the group that Hercules had around him, the anguish that he had to go through with the death of his family and things like that. So the goal was to strike a nice balance between, again, a unique twist on the story, and yet at the same time make sure that we still paid homage to the mythology of Hercules.\n\nQuestion: Since Hercules is public domain, what is it about the graphic novel that made it so specific that you guys wanted to go for that version?\n\nJohnson: You know what it was? It was taking a lot of elements of the mythology, of Hercules, and tweaking them, where ultimately at the end, the greatest thing Hercules can accomplish is accepting his fate and his faith. His faith then becomes his most powerful asset. A lot of times in the past there was -- you know, we didn't want to rely completely on the fables and fantasy elements. We wanted to have some roots being grounded in something. We all felt, by the way, that we were able to strike the balance correctly, where we still paid homage to the Labors and the story of Hercules, but we also made sure that it was really rooted and grounded in something that was very real and something that was palpable to us, today. That palpability would be, you find great power when you have faith -- and not necessarily a religious faith, but just the faith in that things can be better.\n\nQuestion: What about Hercules's lineage and the fact that his father is a god? Are you going to continue that, about Zeus and all that stuff, or do you have to stay away from that?\n\nJohnson: Buddy, no! [Laughs] Yeah, absolutely, yeah... You know what happens? When we first meet this version of Hercules, he's gone through a tremendous amount of trauma and anguish over the fact that he'd murdered his family. So when we see him and he's introduced in this story, he doesn't care about his faith, and he doesn't care about who he is, who everyone claims him to be. It doesn't matter to him, because he doesn't have his family.\n\nQuestion: I think I saw Hydra and Cerberus and the lion, obviously. What other monsters are we going to see? Are they all rooted in his history?\n\nJohnson: Well, yes, in the 12 Labors?\n\nQuestion: Yes, exactly.\n\nJohnson: Yes, we see most of them, and the other ones we know he accomplished. So basically, yes, when we see Hercules now, he's already accomplished these 12 Labors. He's accomplished them. You see the footage of that, of him doing it. So there's a few that we didn't actually see, like the Belt of Hippolyte.\n\nQuestion: What is the tone of this film? Is it completely a strict drama? Do you have comedic elements in it? That is something you bring to your projects sometimes.\n\nJohnson: The tone is a nice, even balance. I think of Gladiator and 300. There's also personality in the movie. There's fun. There's some wink in the movie in a way that makes the audience feel good.\n\nQuestion: Is Hercules a completely strict guy and everyone around him is kind of a bit funnier, or do you have a few one-liners yourself?\n\nJohsnon: Yeah, a few one-liners, sure. I think that always makes it fun, trying to create a heroic character and putting your own twist on it and injecting your own personality into it. You know, the group of actors we had around, everybody came with their A game, all ready to make something that was really, really special. All the actors came on-board knowing that there was another Hercules already being made, knowing that there were other versions of Hercules in the past, in movies and on TV. So everyone got together and wanted to pay homage to the mythology and bring their unique twist.\n\nQuestion: For anybody who follows you on Twitter, can you talk a little bit about the revealing of the look of Hercules? That was something you guys kind of cloaked in mystery for awhile. Can you talk about the reasoning for that and the process of coming up with the look?\n\nJohnson: Well, the reasoning for that was to try and maintain the level of secrecy in terms of the reveal of what Hercules looked like. The reason for that was because it was going to be a complete transformation. For me, as you see me today, I showed up in Budapest like this, so the transformation was probably about three and a half hours a day. It started off at four and a half hours. We really had to -- you just can't make a movie when... [Laughs] Otherwise, the budget balloons. So in the idea of the complete transformation, we really wanted to do our best to make sure that it wasn't revealed, especially if we knew that it was going to be as special -- or at least we hoped it was going to be as special -- as we could create it. So what we did was, they got the best wigmakers in Hollywood -- in the world, by the way -- and beard designers and beard-makers, Oscar winners, all helping to create the transformation. So that's why it took so long. For example, the beard that I had was the full beard, and a lot of times in Hollywood, as you guys know, it's a lace beard that we put on, and they take 30, 45 minutes, an hour tops. This took two and half hours -- three hours, because we had very long strips of yak hair -- really, yak hair -- and they would cut them up probably and inch long and a quarter inch wide, and the process was, they would lay these on my face piece by piece by piece by piece. It was a very, very long process. But in that, what you get is something that is really spectacular. The first couple of days of camera testing and seeing it and recognizing, \"Hey, we've got something really special. Let's do our best to make sure that nothing is revealed.\" So there was a strict mandate that there were no cameras on set. We fired tens upon tens upon tens of people throughout the process. I would say maybe close to 50 people were fired, crew members, all trying to sneak pictures. So there's that. There's mandate, and we all agree on that. But then I told the studio... those guys at Paramount [and MGM], I said, \"Hey, what I'd like to do is take the audience and the fans on a journey from beginning to end, because it's such a passion project for me. So from the time I get to Budapest, I'd like to take them on a journey in terms of what my diet is, what my training is and on set too.\" They said, \"Well, how are you going to do that?\" I said, \"Well, trust me. Somehow I'm going to do it.\" So that's how we came upon all the pictures, however we could do it, where I wasn't necessarily showing my face, but giving the audience a taste of what it's like on set and how things have been going.\n\nQuestion: With regard to the physicality, obviously, you know what you're doing when it comes to preparing for roles.\n\nJohnson: I can fake it pretty good.\n\nQuestion: What was new on this one? A special jump or something, a sword something?\n\nJohnson: [Laughs] In the loin cloth, it's an interesting jump. Well, in terms of the fighting style, I thought it was a very raw fighting style. That had a lot to do with club combat, because Hercules has his famous club. So that was a fun fighting style, because it didn't involve any guns or a specialized fighting style other than he is just a vicious, raw man who is pretty good at what he does. Really, that's it. But the training -- not necessarily the fighting training, but the training in terms of gym training and things like that, that was a lot different than I had ever done. I trained harder for this role than I ever had before. You get one shot at Hercules, so it was about eight months of training, of prep, of fun mythology study, dialect coach, things like that. It was a very long process.\n\nQuestion: Did you do anything crazy like rip somebody's head off or something else that you'd never done before?\n\nJohnson: Well, I've never ripped anybody's head off -- except in my dreams -- but no, nothing, yeah.\n\nQuestion: What about Brett Ratner, because he's not the most conventional director you'd think of for this kind of thing?\n\nJohnson: So there were a lot of directors who had their hands up -- a lot of directors coming in at first. I thought Pete Berg was going to direct it. We had talked about that. Then we went in a different direction and met with a lot of different directors. Then we met with Brett. Brett came to the table very passionate about the project -- as are all directors, by the way; they're very passionate about the project -- but I think the difference with Brett was that -- and I've known Brett for a long time. I got a Brett at a very special time. What I mean by that is he has had great success, he's been down, he's gotten back up. It's in that come-up that I was able to get Brett. He knew he had this incredible opportunity. He was very passionate about the project, very passionate about Hercules and very passionate about doing something that was very special. Also, I got a very hungry Brett Ratner. You guys have known Brett for a long time. You know he's a great guy, he's a talented guy, he's a fun guy. It was good to see him at this level and raise his game.\n\nQuestion: Who was your Hercules growing up? Steve Reeves, Lou Ferrigno? Who was the character for you?\n\nJohnson: It was always Steve Reeves, yeah. That's a great question. Always Steve Reeves. When I was a kid, I was always enamored by -- I appreciated the movies, and I was able to see them on VHS when I was a kid, but I was so enamored by the one-sheets and the posters. I had them in my room when I was a kid. So yeah, it was always Steve Reeves. He's the first one, you know?\n\nQuestion: Is there an homage to Steve Reeves in this?\n\nJohnson: That's a good question. Well, you can't match his looks, you know? Good-looking guy. [Laughs] No, other than just paying great respect. I appreciate Steve, because Steve, he was the very first Hercules and just a good-looking guy, movie star.\n\nQuestion: Was he an inspiration for you to get into bodybuilding?\n\nJohnson: No, he was a little bit before my time, I think. It started for me when I was 14. When I was a kid, we were in Hawaii -- and I might have shared this story before with you guys, but it wound up being one of those definitive stories in my life. When I was a kid at 14, and we were in Hawaii, we were evicted out of our little efficiency. We came home and it had a padlock on the door. I saw my mom crying -- it was me and my mom -- and she was tapped out. There was nothing we could do, padlock on the door. I just remember at that time thinking I never wanted this to happen again, so I wanted to become a success somehow so we'd never get locked out again and never get evicted. So in my mind at that time, at 14, the men who were successful were Stallone and Schwarzenegger and guys like that -- Harrison Ford -- who were these men of action. I was like, \"Okay, they're successful, they're not getting evicted, they built their bodies -- I'm gonna go build my body.\" It was like that. [Laughs]\n\nQuestion: You mentioned the raw combat style. What is the violence level of this film? Is it really brutal?\n\nJohnson: It's PG-13. We pushed the limit. What's great I think is that when you have a project like this, where the fighting style is brutality -- and it's that fun brutality, in a way that you know that you're PG-13, so \"Let's get creative.\" A lot of times, as you guys know, it's about how much blood you see -- and intention; the intention to brutalize is high, but we try to keep the blood as minimal as possible. I think you're going to be happy, if you have a thirst for that, like occasionally I do. [Laughs]\n\nQuestion: You mentioned all the work you put into the beard, and then we see you in the lion's head. I'm just curious how much work you put into making that look real and authentic to the times, and how did it feel to finally wear that?\n\nJohnson: We have the best costume designers. Again, with a project like this, I was very happy to -- at the time when we were putting this on its feet, I had G.I. Joe coming out, and then Pain & Gain, and then Fast & Furious; it was a long string of movies that I had coming out. So I was getting all these reports from our producers and the studio saying, \"Hey, this is our DP,\" \"Hey, this is our set designer,\" \"Hey, this is our wardrobe designer.\" They were all, again, award-winning designers. To answer your question, there was so much passion put into the design of the wardrobe and everything that was on set. So when you see the armor and the lion head, the club, it all looks very real and authentic. In Budapest, I took the club home with me every night back to the room, and the lion head.\n\nQuestion: [Laughs] Every night?\n\nJohnson: Yeah, just a habit, to remain in the spirit. It kept me sane with those two things -- and a bottle of tequila. [Laughs]\n\nQuestion: Speaking of Pain & Gain, that was my favorite performance of yours.\n\nJohnson: Thank you, man.\n\nQuestion: Is there a difference in how you approach that kind of character versus how you approach a demigod like Hercules, or is it the same process for you coming into it?\n\nJohnson: It's pretty much the same process, especially with those two characters, where they're a bit heightened, and yet at the same time you still want to ground them in some reality and some humanity. There's an empathy to them as well, because to compare both of those characters, I mean, they're both big characters with a lot of things going on, and a lot of violence happening with both of these men. But yeah, it's pretty much the same process. I have a specific set of tools that I like to continue to add to as the years progress and the movies progress, and then bring that to these characters.\n\nQuestion: There's some pathos to that character in Pain & Gain. Is there that same kind of thing with Hercules, with his family? Do you bring that same sort of element in?\n\nJohnson: There is, yes. That's a great comparison. I never drew the parallels until now, now that you're talking about it, but yes. For me, as an actor and then going into Hercules, finding Hercules like this -- this is why for me it's been a passion project for 10 years. I'm so grateful that I didn't make it when I first asked about it. I first asked about it when I came to Hollywood 14 years ago. I asked about Hercules and Walking Tall, but at that time I was actually shooting Scorpion King, so it was a little close. I'm happy I didn't make it back then, because I couldn't have brought I think the same weight and substance, just living as a man and having the experiences I've had today. So what I loved about this version of Hercules was that he was older, he was more experienced. When we meet him, he's going through a lot of pain, and he has no family. His family's been murdered.\n\nQuestion: Do you want to tell just one story as Hercules, or would you want to go through it all again and do another film?\n\nJohnson: Sure, sure. It all depends obviously on the box office and how much fans enjoy it. If they enjoy it, one of the cool qualities about Hercules is that the stories and the mythology of Hercules, they continue. They continue, where he teams up with Jason and the Argonauts. So there's a lot of different ways we can go. Yeah, I'd love to. Sure.\n\nQuestion: Did you have any acting pals that begged to come on and do a cameo in this one or go into that world with you? Not that I want to see Mark Wahlberg as Jason.\n\nJohnson: [Laughs] Well, I'm not giving anything away, but there was a moment where -- and we just couldn't make the schedules align -- it was going to me and Russell Crowe, and we were going to set something up. But that's done with... Maybe down the road -- but, you know, just to give you an idea of just how exciting and the different ways we can go. There are a lot of different characters that Hercules comes in contact with.\n\nQuestion: You filmed in Budapest. I'm curious if there were other places you considered for tax reasons about filming in another location, or was it always Budapest?\n\nJohnson: No, originally it was Romania -- for tax benefits, and there was also sound stages there and things like that. Plus, Romania, there's a great landscape there that can play very well. Didn't work out in Romania. Then we brought our crew and gang over to Budapest, and Budapest ended up working extremely well. They had amazing sound stages there. Their landscape -- there are parts of Budapest way out in the hills that look very survived, and it played very well for us.\n\nQuestion: I'm curious about the chronology of this story. You said we see some of the 12 Labors. Does the story proper take place after he's done all the Labors? Is it like an in-between time?\n\nJohnson: Correct. When we meet him, he's completed his Labors, and he's also been exiled out of Athens by King Eurystheus. Now he just kills for money. But we do see the Labors, though. We make sure that we pay proper homage, again, to them. He has a multitude of flashbacks, including killing his family.\n\nQuestion: So have you seen a rough cut yet, or a final cut?\n\nJohnson: It's not final yet, so we haven't locked it yet, but yes, I've seen the rough cut.\n\nQuestion: So how does it compare, what you've seen thus far, to what you had envisioned going in? Does it exceed your expectations?\n\nJohnson: It's everything I'd hoped it to be and more -- because you never know with a movie like this. You never know with a movie this size and scope and a lot of different elements going on, where if you're going to make it, you get one shot at it. It's not like an action-comedy or an action movie that plays today, where you have a little bit of leeway, latitude, with what you shoot and what you can get away with. With something like this -- epic in nature -- it is Hercules, and he's the world's first superhero. There've been versions in the past, but we wanted to make the definitive Hercules. So going into it, there's a lot of unpredictability. You hope that everyone comes with their A game, which they did. It was a very long shoot, man. Over six months, we were there -- a lot of days, lot of long shoots, lot of long hours. You know, as you're shooting it, it feels good to you, but you never know. You hope, and you have your gut sense, but in this case, yeah, it's everything that I'd hoped it to be. The biggest thing for me was just making sure that, if the transformation was going to happen, it looked real and it felt real and authentic. It's me in a wig -- regardless if the wig took 40 days to actually make, the majority of them. Everything had to come together nicely, and I thought it did.\n\nQuestion: So is this a revenge-type thing, like, you're trying to find the killers of your family? Was there a romantic element in this movie?\n\nJohnson: Let's see... There was a romantic element with Ergenia, who was my wife until she was murdered -- there went that romance! [Laughs] Maybe in the next one he'll meet something. Is there a revenge aspect? Well, here's the unique twist on it. One of the unique twists is that it starts off with anguish and pain, internally, then it becomes revenge when I find out who really killed my family.\n\nQuestion: Did anyone make you watch any of the Kellan Lutz Hercules?\n\nJohnson: \"Make me!\" [Laughs] No, I actually didn't see it, no. Did you guys see it? You had to see it.\n\nHercules opens July 25.", "530": "Since Walt Disney's Captain America: The Winter Soldier is opening in the UK on Wednesday and Paramount's Noah opening in America and elsewhere this Friday, it stands to reason that the studios are tossing out their big guns, especially for the summer films that haven't teased yet (Paramount will be dropping their Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles teaser on Thursday). So now we have this trailer to Dwayne Johnson's Hercules.\n\nThe Paramount release at least gets the first thing about trailer construction very wrong: The trailer is narrated by Ian McShane despite featuring a supporting turn from John Hurt! If your film stars John Hurt, you darn-well have John Hurt narrate your trailer! So it's already the \"worst trailer ever\". Jokes aside, it's a brisk and relatively spoiler-free look at what audiences theoretically will want to see: Dwayne Johnson ripped beyond reason and trashing opponents of the human, animal, and monster variety in a mythical setting.\n\nWhat's interesting about this film is that we're in a position where a big-budget major studio action-adventure film starring Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnson, directed by Brett Ratner no less, is in the position of being something of an underdog this summer. It opens on July 25th, existing right between Jupiter Ascending (an obvious wildcard from the Wachowskis) and Guardians of the Galaxy. Of course, the film cost \"just\" $110 million, so the Brett Ratner vehicle, which will of course be released in 3D, only has to make 300: Rise of an Empire numbers ($288m and counting) to make a token profit.\n\nSuch is life where a $110 million Dwayne Johnson period-piece action epic directed by Brett Ratner considered the summer time equivalent of a B-movie. For the record, as Dorothy Pomerantz correctly pointed out back in January, the critical and commercial failure of the Lionsgate pick-up The Legend of Hercules will have zero bearing on this film's success. If a tree falls in a forest and all. What this film does signal is an attempt for Dwayne Johnson to have a new franchise of his very own.\n\nDwayne Johnson has become something of a running joke in terms of joining already established franchises and giving them a box office boost. Be it the Universal's Fast/Furious films, Warner Bros.' Journey 2: The Mysterious Island ($335m worldwide off a $79m budget), Paramount's G.I. Joe Retaliation ($375m off a $130m budget), or even Universal's The Mummy Returns ($433m off a $98m budget back in 2001), the man often referred to as \"The Rock\" has a knack for latching onto franchises that suit his sensibilities and/or his fan base and allowing them to reach new heights. But Johnson's attempts to score solo have been mixed at best.\n\nAside from his now standard \"hard action guy makes a PG-rated comedy around domestication and kids\" entries The Tooth Fairy ($112 million worldwide in 2010) and The Game Plan ($147m in 2007), Dwayne Johnson's biggest solo outing is still his first one, specifically the Mummy Returns spin-off The Scorpion King. People like to consider that one a flop, but in truth it earned $165m off a $60m budget back in April 2002, and adjusted for inflation would be about $275m today.\n\nAfter that it was several years of box office whiffs like The Rundown (a terrific action comedy, but one that earned $80m off a $85m budget), Walking Tall, and Doom. He spent the next few years as a family film lead, with the above-mentioned Tooth Fairy and Game Plan scoring alongside Gridiron Gang ($40m off a $30m budget) in 2006 along with Disney's Escape From With Mountain ($106m worldwide) and Sony's animated film Planet 51 ($105m, but with a $70m budget) in 2009.\n\nHis other two major films, along with the little-seen indie Southland Tales, were ones where he made a point to stand out in a crowded ensemble, with Get Smart in 2008 ($230m, but with a role guaranteed not to come back for the sequel) and the terrible Get Shorty sequel Be Cool in 2005 (where he earned strong critical notices as an openly gay bodyguard/enforcer). His next shot at action stardom came in the form of 2010's Faster. But the R-rated picture was more drama than action, and it earned $35m on a $24m budget.\n\nAfter that is where we enter the period of Dwayne Johnson: Franchise Savior. Dwayne Johnson is clearly a \"star\" in the sense that the media loves him, everyone knows who he is, and he is a genuine added-value element to any film he makes. But Hercules will be an attempt to cash in on the three years of capitol accumulated by the likes of G.I. Joe 2 and Fast & Furious 6. Obviously the $42m gross of last year's (very good) Snitch won't cut it on this scale.\n\nHercules has nothing to offer beyond Dwayne Johnson as a somewhat iconic action hero. This is no ensemble piece or established franchise. This is Dwayne Johnson's \"face on the poster\" test. Of course it's also a chance for Brett Ratner to score a controversy-free hit after the underrated Tower Heist ($152 million off a $75m budget) was overshadowed by a foot-in-mouth comment that angered the gay community right and cost him his Oscar ceremony producing gig, but that's for another day.\n\nFor now the question is whether or not Hercules is the movie to prove that The Rock is a movie star all by himself and/or whether or not such a movie exists. Hercules opens from Paramount on July 25th. As always, we'll see.\n\nAlso on Forbes:", "531": "He declined to identify the character, but did tweet that he's a well-known character who's never been played before onscreen.\n\nIt's probably safe to assume that's on the big screen, or in live action, since virtually every DC character has appeared on shows like Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold at one point or another.\n\nHere's the tweet in question:\n\nMyself & DC have agreed on a character.. extremely complex, well known (but never played) and a pure BAD ASS MF;) #RockTalk .@ThomasEspin \u2014 Dwayne Johnson (@TheRock) March 25, 2014\n\n\"Here are three qualities,\" Johnson said. \"The first quality we were looking for was that he had to be extremely complex and have a lot going on.

The other quality was that he had to \u2014 the character we were looking for had to be well-known but never brought to life. Then what that does again as an actor, it gives me a little bit of space, and we talked about personality. It just gives me a chance to put an imprint into his personality, with the set of tools that I could bring to the table and put a very unique twist on his personality, but still pay homage to who he is. The third thing \u2014 and most important \u2014 is he had to be a badass motherf--ker, okay, and on a Superman level of power, where could throw down. In those three qualities, I\u2019m happy we\u2019ve found that character. Right now, we\u2019re out to a lot of writers.\"", "532": "Paramount Pictures gathered a small group of journalists Monday at CinemaCon in Las Vegas for a preview of director Brett Ratner\u2019s Hercules, which the studio describes as \u201ca revisionist take on the classic myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tone is a nice, even balance,\u201d Dwayne Johnson, who stars as the legendary hero, told reporters. \u201cI think of Gladiator and 300. There's also personality in the movie. There's fun. There's some wink in the movie in a way that makes the audience feel good.\u201d\n\nOpening July 25, the film is based on the 2008 Radical Publishing miniseries Hercules: The Thracian Wars, which depicts the hero and his loyal companions traveling ancient Greece, working as mercenaries. The teaser trailer flashed scenes from the famous twelve labors, including such CG creatures as the Nemean lion, the Lernaean hydra and three-headed Cerberus. Other scenes were reminiscent of the more grandiose sequences from the aforementioned period epics, with battalions of armored soldiers preparing for battle.\n\n\u201cFor me, as an actor and then going into Hercules, finding Hercules like this \u2013 this [has] been a passion project for 10 years,\u201d explained Johnson, who has long pursued the role of the demigod.\n\n\u201cI'm so grateful that I didn't make it when I first asked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI first asked about it when I came to Hollywood 14 years ago. I asked about Hercules and Walking Tall, but at that time I was actually shooting Scorpion King, so it was a little close. I'm happy I didn't make it back then, because I couldn't have brought I think the same weight and substance, just living as a man and having the experiences I've had today.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t limit the discussion to Hercules, as he also tackled his attachment to a couple of storied DC Comics characters. When asked about his long-rumored role as Green Lantern John Stewart, he responded, \u201cSo, you know, there's been mutual interest with myself and DC for many years to find the right character. I, like everyone here in the room, love superheroes. So there's been mutual interest with us for years, and we've been having ongoing discussions, myself and DC, for years about the right character, what the right character would be. That's another thing, too: It had to be right.\"\n\nWhen pressed for which role he was in talks to play, Johnson cryptically responded with three qualities of the character.\n\n\u201cThe first quality we were looking for was that he had to be extremely complex and have a lot going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that does for me as an actor and the studio is it gives us space that we can explore; his complexities.\n\n\u201cThe other quality was that he had to \u2013 the character we were looking for had to be well-known but never brought to life.

It just gives me a chance to put an imprint into his personality, with the set of tools that I could bring to the table and put a very unique twist on his personality, but still pay homage to who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third thing \u2013 and most important \u2013 is he had to be a badass motherfucker, OK, and on a Superman level of power, where [he] could throw down. In those three qualities, I'm happy we've found that character.\u201d\n\nHe also talked about how he became involved with his upcoming disaster movie San Andreas. \u201cYeah, so I read the script when I was in Budapest, and I loved the script and the idea of being in a disaster movie that felt very real and very grounded, based of course on the San Andreas Fault,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI did a lot of research on the fault and sat down with geologists over in Budapest. We had a great meeting. So it felt very real and very grounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe script came in \u2013 by the Hayes brothers, who wrote The Conjuring, and we're working on some other stuff together. They delivered a great script. [Director] Brad Peyton came in and flew to Budapest. We had a couple of directors fly out, but he came in \u2013 not only because of the relationship I'd had with Brad from a movie that we did three or four years ago \u2013 Journey 2: The Mysterious Island -- but he came in and had an awesome take, just visually and stylistically, I think what Brad's going to be able to do with an earthquake movie in 3D \u2013 first 3D earthquake disaster movie ever filmed \u2013 and the opportunity of playing a first responder in the LA Fire Department was exciting.\u201d\n\nBatman Writer Tom King Details Plans for the Remainder of His Run", "533": "It's not every actor who is willing (or able) to take on one of the world's most iconic roles, but Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is hardly your run-of-the-mill thesp. The 6-foot-five action star jumped at the chance to portray Greek mythology's most famous demigod \u2014 and based on the pics he's shared on Twitter so far, he quite possibly embodies Hercules like no man has before.\n\nOn Saturday, he tweeted an image of himself in full Herculean garb, bracing himself against three massive horses. But it's not the animals that steal the show; it's The Rock's completely yoked shoulders and back.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that he's in stunning shape for this role, considering the workout routine he followed in preparation for the film, which sounded grueling \u2014 even for him.\n\n\"It's incredible, he's up every morning at 3:45 right on the treadmill, then it was right to the gym for hours,\" producer Beau Flynn explained to USA Today. \"And then it was to the makeup chair, then shooting all day in the heat. And repeat that for 90 days.\"\n\nIt seems all his hard work paid off. On Monday, Johnson shared another pic, depicting himself in the throngs of battle, complete with flexing muscles, a giant club, and yes, a beard made of \"yes, real yak hair.\" Johnson admitted that looking picture-perfect was a big effort, and required 3.5 hours to complete. (They eventually got the processes down to 2.5, but still.)\n\n\"The No. 1 goal is to make the definitive version of 'Hercules,'\" said Johnson. \"We know we're going to be under a microscope.\"\n\nIn pursuit of this lofty aim, director Brett Ratner begins the tale just after the hero has endured his 12 Labors. (In case your mythology is a little rusty, those were Hercules's punishments for killing his family in a fit of insanity and included slaying the nine-headed hydra and the Nemean lion.)\n\nShowing off some of the lengths he went to for the part, Johnson tweeted a shot from set of his broad, bloodied back.

I gave it my all and made myself pass out every time we did it. But I honestly felt in that moment that I was born to play this role.\" We can't argue with you there.\n\n\"Hercules\" opens in theaters July 25.", "534": "There was a Hercules film that hit theatres a few months ago, maybe more. It didn't do well, probably because the title role wasn't played by the Rock, better known these days as Dwayne Johnson.\n\nJohnson plays the half-man, half-god in the upcoming movie, \"Hercules: The Thracian Wars,\" set to release in July. He tweeted action photos of himself on Monday in anticipation of the trailer's Tuesday release, according to Entertainment Wise.\n\nSay what you want about Rock, but the man consistently reaches a certain quality in his movies. They'll probably never make the Oscars, but they're usually watchable and sometimes even more (personal favorites: \"The Rundown\" and \"Walking Tall\").\n\nIt took the muscle-bound Johnson eight months of training to prepare his body for the role. A decade or so ago, that period might have been cut in half. Now that he's 41, resembling half a Greek god takes time.\n\n\"It's incredible, he's up every morning at 3:45 right on the treadmill, then it was right to the gym for hours,\" producer Beau Flynn told Entertainmentwise. \"And then it was to the makeup chair, then shooting all day in the heat.

First, the synopsis of the movie:\n\nEveryone knows the legend of Hercules and his twelve labors. Our story begins after the labors, and after the legend... Haunted by a sin from his past, Hercules has become a mercenary. Along with five faithful companions, he travels ancient Greece selling his services for gold and using his legendary reputation to intimidate enemies. But when the benevolent ruler of Thrace and his daughter seek Hercules' help to defeat a savage and terrifying warlord, Hercules finds that in order for good to triumph and justice to prevail... he must again become the hero he once was... he must embrace his own myth... he must be Hercules.\n\nI'll always be a mark for the television series Kevin Sorbo played the lead in but Rock has become a legitimate star in Hollywood who commands real respect. Perhaps this will be much better than it sounds.\n\nHere's the full poster:\n\nThe first trailer is expected to drop tomorrow.", "536": "An extensive nutritional comparison of the currently reigning popular diets concludes that, as a strict regimen, not a single one of them is best. The conclusion of this scientific study is as follows: You shouldn\u2019t be an ovine, diet-deranged lemming, but rather the intelligent, food-eating person you know you can be.\n\nScientific publisher Annual Reviews asked Dr. David Katz and Stephanie Meller, both from Yale University\u2019s Prevention Research Center, to compare medical evidence for each major mainstream diet du jour. The pair rigorously compared low-carb, low-fat, low-glycemic, Mediterranean, mixed/balanced (DASH), Paleolithic, and vegan diets \u2014 and write-in vote Michael Pollan won!\n\nPollan\u2019s seven-word diet of \u201cEat food, not too much, mostly plants\u201d was the only conclusion from this extensive comparison. Dr. Katz literally describes diet developers as classic evil villains, rubbing their hands together to create a best-selling food fad and peddling empty promises. Just read ingredients and use diets as helpful guidelines. You don\u2019t need to get your information from the mustache-twirling snake-oil salesmen of our time: diet-book writers.\n\nThe best part is the takedown of Paleo, where Katz and Meller wrote:\n\nMany of the plant foods and nearly all of the animal foods consumed during the remote Stone Age are now extinct. Whereas the composition of some animals\u2019 flesh may mimic that of mammoths, the composition of the flesh of animals most often appearing in the food supply does not. If Paleolithic eating is loosely interpreted to mean a diet based mostly on meat, no meaningful interpretation of health effects is possible.\n\nAs an allegorical illustration of all the dubious promises of fad diets, that is a wonderful paragraph.", "537": "The number of mumps cases continues to grow, and it is not just the Ohio State University community reporting them.\n\n\n\nColumbus health officials now say there are at least 69 mumps cases that have been reported across Franklin County. 52 of the cases are linked to the university.\n\n\n\nThe cases in the community have affected residents between the ages of 4 and 55.\n\n\n\nHealth officials are encouraging individuals with the highest risk of mumps, those who have not received any doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and those who have received only 1 dose of MMR, to get vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\u201cMumps can lead to serious complications in people who are not vaccinated, especially adults. If you have not been vaccinated against the mumps, or do not remember if you have received the protective vaccine, get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" said Dr. Teresa Long, Columbus Public Health Commissioner, in a news release.\n\n\n\nThe following medical information is from local health officials:\n\n\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as cups or soft drink cans, can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared.\n\n\n\nMost mumps transmissions likely occur before the salivary glands begin to swell and within five days after the swelling begins. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends isolating mumps patients for five days after their glands begin to swell.\n\n\n\nAmong males, mumps can lead to orchitis, a testicular inflammation that causes pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting and fever. Among some women with mumps, inflammation of the ovaries or breasts can occur. Up to 15 percent of people with mumps also may suffer headaches and stiff necks.\n\n\n\nAnyone who experiences these symptoms should contact their health care professional immediately.\n\n\n\nWhat to Do if You Become Infected with Mumps:\n\n1.

The numerous violations include that Phusion allegedly promoted their product to underage persons, promoted dangerous and excessive consumption, failed to disclose the dangers of combining alcoholic beverages with caffeine to consumers and that before 2011 actually manufactured, marketed and sold caffeinated alcoholic beverages that were unsafe. Which they did and it tasted pretty awful (oh dear god, the memories of the watermelon flavor) and generally just made us miss Sparks.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Phusion has agreed to discontinue a number of practices related to the sale and promotion of its flavored malt beverages, especially those that were marketed to college students and paired with ads featuring actors who appeared to be underage. If that is the case, who the hell are they going to market to on their Facebook page then? Because it currently looks like Spring Break threw up all over it.\n\nPhusion also cannot promote mixing malt beverages with caffeine products, hire underage persons to promote alcoholic products (um, that seems like a given), hire models or actors for promotional material who are under the age of 25 or appear to be under the age of 21, promote flavored malt beverages on school or college property except at retail locations licensed to sell alcoholic products or use any college name, logos or mascot in any promotions material. All of this seems pretty common sense if you are selling a product that is toeing the line in taste when it comes to the popular college age pastime known as binge drinking.\n\nPhusion must also pay up $400,000 to the City Attorney of San Francisco and the State Attorney General who are signatories to the settlement and promptly remove from its website and social media any postings that depict or condone the misuse of alcohol. Which frankly, if you are drinking Four Loko, you are misusing alcohol. Currently there is a photo on their Facebook of a shirtless man wearing a snake drinking Four Loko, which we're not sure if that falls into a grey area of misuse or not. Regardless, keep on keeping on, party guy.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull and vodka continues to be the standard drink that leaves many folks on the bathroom floor feeling like their heart is about to jump out of their chest come 2 a.m. but no one seems to mind that combination. Mainly because Red Bull has been pretty smart not to actively promote the cult favorite cocktail. And who would have thought, the giant energy drink looking can of sugary sweet malt booze would go over so well with the cheap college crowd? We once saw some some friends chase vodka shots with Slimfast at a college party so we know it could always be worse. It just goes back to the fact that if you are drinking in excess make sure to know your liquor and your mixers, be smart and hopefully be able to afford something better than Four Loko or at least go old school with some MD 20/20.", "539": "Air Pollution Now Linked To 1 In 8 Deaths Worldwide\n\nAir Pollution Now Linked To 1 In 8 Deaths Worldwide, UN Health Agency Reports\n\nNew York, Mar 25 2014 - Air pollution \u2013 both indoor and outdoor \u2013 killed some 7 million people across the globe in 2012, making it the world\u2019s largest single environmental health risk, according to new figures released today by the UN World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\u201cThe risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,\u201d said Maria Neira, Director of WHO\u2019s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health.\n\n\u201cFew risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe,\u201d Dr. Neira added.\n\nIn particular, the new data, which cites air pollution as the cause of one in eight global deaths, reveals a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to pollution\u2019s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\n\n\u201cCleaning up the air we breathe prevents noncommunicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,\u201d Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General Family, Women and Children\u2019s Health said. \u201cPoor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.\u201d\n\nAnalysing the risk factors, taking into account revisions in methodology, WHO estimates indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution's role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers.\n\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, the agency estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide. The most air pollution-related deaths occurred in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, according to WHO, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and some 2.6 million related to outdoor pollution.\n\nMany people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the total estimate of around 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\n\u201cExcessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry. In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to health-care cost savings as well as climate gains,\u201d Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health said.\n\n\u201cWHO and health sectors have a unique role in translating scientific evidence on air pollution into policies that can deliver impact and improvements that will save lives,\u201d Dr. Dora added.\n\nThe release of today\u2019s data is a step in the development of a WHO roadmap for preventing diseases related to air pollution. This involves the development of a WHO-hosted global platform on air quality and health to generate better data on air pollution-related diseases and strengthened support to countries and cities through guidance, information and evidence about health gains from key interventions.\n\nFor more details go to UN News Centre at http://www.un.org/news\n\nENDS\n\n\u00a9 Scoop Media\n\n"},
