REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.\n\nIn order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it \u201csterilizes\u201d the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.\n\nEighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.\n\nSome economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday\u2019s monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.\n\nIn the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be \u201crelatively limited\u201d.\n\nThe poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB\u2019s three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.\n\nThe euro zone\u2019s central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks\u2019 coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.\n\nBanks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.\n\nThis week\u2019s repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc\u2019s financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.\n\nOf those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.\n\nThe regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.\n\nEighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.\n\n($1 = 0.7214 euros)", "4": "The European Union\u2019s half-baked banking union could be made to work \u2013 even though it wasn\u2019t strictly needed to solve the euro zone\u2019s problems and what has been agreed isn\u2019t what the designers wanted.\n\nThe original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.\n\nDuring the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That\u2019s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.\n\nIn the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn\u2019t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn\u2019t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries\u2019 banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks \u2013 though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.\n\nDespite all this, banking union doesn\u2019t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn\u2019t actually need one.\n\nIn 2012 much was made of the \u201cdoom loop\u201d that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.\n\nThis doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.\n\nLook, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don\u2019t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.\n\nThat, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, \u201cbailing in\u201d bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.\n\nThe EU is doing all this too. But it didn\u2019t require banking union to push it forward.\n\nThat said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.\n\nFirst, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as \u201cmacroprudential\u201d powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks\u2019 capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.\n\nThe snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units \u2013 the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.\n\nSecond, many banks don\u2019t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don\u2019t have to ride to the rescue.\n\nThis can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system \u2013 and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up \u201cresolution plans\u201d that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker\u2019s yard without too much contagion.\n\nAgain, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks\u2019 resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions \u2013 and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.\n\nNow look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can\u2019t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments\u2019 bonds.\n\nThe ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don\u2019t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone\u2019s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.", "5": "* Countries grapple for deal to prevent embarrassing delay\n\n* Ministers to debate scheme to close banks\n\n* Much still up for grabs, including imposing investor losses\n\nBy Jan Strupczewski and John O\u2019Donnell\n\nBRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - European governments and lawmakers will try to reach a deal this week on how to wind down failing banks, clearing the way for a landmark reform as time runs out to win European Parliament approval before May elections.\n\nNegotiations are set to span days and may be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for euro zone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one pot of money to pay for it.\n\n\u201cThere will not be an outcome today or tomorrow, because the real negotiations will take place on Wednesday and days after that if necessary,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is chairing Monday\u2019s meeting of euro ministers, told reporters, referring to talks with the European Parliament\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nAs he entered for the first day of talks with European counterparts, Spain\u2019s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he was optimistic agreement could be clinched.\n\nTalks on a new European agency to shut down failing banks, and on a fund to pay for such closures, need to be agreed before the last sitting of the European Parliament in mid-April.\n\nFailure to do so would delay the law by at least seven months, and probably more. It could also mean it is scrutinised by a new group of lawmakers with a higher count of eurosceptics, as such parties are expected to do well in the May poll.\n\nThe banking union, and the clean-up of banks\u2019 books that will accompany it, is intended to restore banks\u2019 confidence in one another and boost lending across the currency bloc, helping foster growth in the 18 economies that use the euro.\n\n\u201cThis is a large scale political project which will allow countries to borrow at the same rate whether you are Spanish, Italian, German or French,\u201d French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters.\n\nNew lending has been throttled by banks\u2019 efforts to raise capital and cut their risks in recession.\n\nThe banking union is also supposed to break the vicious circle of indebted states and the banks that buy their debt, treated in law as \u2018risk-free\u2019 despite Greece\u2019s default in all but name.\n\nEuro zone banks now hold about 1.75 trillion euros of government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to the European Central Bank. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the banking system is now on loan to governments.\n\nThe biggest political reform since the launch of the euro currency, banking union also touches on sensitive issues for investors, including the imposition of losses on bondholders of failing banks.\n\nPolicymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank will be the supervisor for euro zone banks, a role it takes on in November.\n\nIn return for giving its blessing to the wider scheme, Germany wants to see losses imposed from that point onwards on bondholders and others who have backed troubled banks.\n\nTUG OF WAR\n\nOfficials caution that a deal may not be possible this week and could be postponed until the end of the month.\n\nTo further complicate matters, European governments disagree not only amongst themselves, but also with the European Parliament, which must give its blessing to the project before it can become law.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is the complex process of closing a bank. Countries are reluctant to cede authority to Brussels and want a laborious system of checks before any decision to shut a bank can be taken.\n\nEU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the euro zone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that the decision must then be signed into law by the finance ministers.\n\nUnder that scenario, if the ministers want to change the board\u2019s decision, they also have to involve the European Commission and start a procedure so complex that it is doubtful it can be completed quickly.\n\nThe European Parliament, on the other hand, wants no involvement of EU ministers, arguing it would politicise the process and make it cumbersome. It wants leave the final go-ahead to the more impartial European Commission.\n\nParliament also wants the ECB - the supervisor of all banks - to be the only institution to declare a bank is failing. EU governments want the agency board and national authorities to have a say.\n\nGovernments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the \u2018resolution\u2019 fund, used to cover the costs of shutting a bank, and how soon countries should be able to dip into the pot. The fund will be filled by euro zone banks and is slated to reach around 55 billion euros ($76 billion).\n\nGovernments want the fund to reach full size over 10 years, while the parliament wants the fund to be fully available to all euro zone countries after just three years.\n\nFinally, policymakers must decide if they will allow this fund to borrow if it is short of cash, or if it should borrow from the euro zone bailout fund or receive state guarantees.", "6": "FRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank\u2019s emphasis on slack in the euro zone economy at its March policy meeting shows it intends to keep interest rates low even if growth rates pick up, sending a dovish message.\n\nInvestors, however, were disappointed by the ECB\u2019s lack of action last week, when the bank published an inflation forecast for 2016 that sees price rises still far below its target for price stability of below but close to 2 percent.\n\nThe euro rose against the dollar to a 2-1/2 year high after the ECB signalled no need for new economic stimulus and took a slightly more optimistic view of the recovery. That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send.\n\nFor the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to \u201cthe high degree of unutilised capacity\u201d in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term.\n\n\u201cOur monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy,\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi said.\n\nAhead of the meeting, a growing minority of economists polled by Reuters said the ECB may be forced to print money this year to fight off deflation risks, while some had expected a cut in interest rates, below the record low of 0.25 percent.\n\nThe fact that the ECB refrained from suspending the weekly withdrawal of money it spent on Greek and other governments\u2019 bonds during the debt crisis - the least divisive \u201csterlisation\u201d measure - suggests the ECB may have to take a big step next or none at all.\n\nTAKING THE SHINE OFF\n\nDeutsche Bank, for example, now expects rates to remain at a record low of 0.25 percent throughout this year.\n\n\u201cThe ECB seems to be \u2018hoping for the best\u2019, and we have probably underestimated the limitations to the Governing Council\u2019s room for manoeuvre on its policy instruments in the last few months,\u201d said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche.\n\nDraghi said the benefits of a so-called sterilisation of bond purchases under its Securities Markets Programme were \u201crelatively limited\u201d because of the short maturity of the bonds still in the SMP portfolio, currently worth 175 billion euros ($242.58 billion).\n\nA programme to revive the market for securitised loans, especially for small and medium sized companies, remains on the agenda, but may require legal and regulatory changes and third party guarantees in order to work, Draghi said.\n\nThe ECB could launch another long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), similar to the three-year loans they handed out in late 2011 and early 2012 to ease banks\u2019 funding strains, but banks are increasingly paying back such loans early.\n\nWhich leaves the most powerful tool to fight deflation, quantitative easing, by which the central bank would buy securities from banks that have then more money to lend.\n\nBut while other major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have long been relying on this stimulus, QE would be a highly political tool to agree on in the euro zone with its 18 member countries.\n\nInflation would have to undershoot the ECB\u2019s target for price stability significantly to sway the Governing Council.\n\nA further appreciation of the euro might do just that.\n\nThe euro hit a 2-1/2 year high on Friday at $1.3915.\n\nECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Monday he was \u201cnot very happy\u201d with the recent appreciation of the euro\u2019s exchange rate, because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.

As everyone notes repeatedly, you can\u2019t trust Chinese data, but if we were to trust the latest inflation data, we should start worrying about deflation instead of inflation. The PBOC target is 3.5%, by the way. Suppliers to China\u2014like Australia\u2014are not failing to notice. A global slowdown inspired by a Chinese slowdown is back on the fear-list, along with the inevitable suggestion that the motive for devaluation is the classic one, to promote exports, in the guise of corralling speculators.\n\nThe other big issue is the collection of worries about Europe\u2019s institutional infrastructure. We pretty much stopped worrying about it when the peripheral sovereign debt crisis abated, but the inability to work together to put a bank failure mechanism in place is a pretty big failure.

Meanwhile, the Europeans can\u2019t get their act together on sanctions against Russia, either.\n\nWe believe Merkel when she says sanctions are a real possibility, but the French are not willing to give up their sale of warships, and evading sanctions is a time-honored business practice in many countries. Europe has long preferred to spend public money on social programs rather than defense, and why not, since the US has been willing to take that expense. But at some point the absence of a coherent European foreign policy is damaging to reputations. As we have noted many times before, a reserve currency is classically the currency of the top military power of the day. The eurozone is trying to redefine a reserve currency as coming from the bloc that has the gold standard of fiscal excellence.

He said \"It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment. We are clearly not very happy at the moment.\"\n\nNoyer says everything is on track and there is no need for the ECB to take any of the many possible actions if \u201cprospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.\u201d Meanwhile, Noyer claims a plan is on track for French banks to securitize bundles of small business loans, possibly as early as end-March or April and forming a model for the rest of Europe.\n\nGee, what could go wrong?

REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nGood morning. Here's what you need to know.\n\nChinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. \"Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan (CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014,\" say economists at Standard Chartered.\n\nChinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.\n\nCopper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.\n\nQuiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.\n\nJapan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.\n\nRecord Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of \u00a51.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to \u00a52.345 trillion fom \u00a51.047 trillion. \"Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments,\" says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.\n\nEuro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high.

Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011.

Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. \"Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow,\" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. \"For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine).\"\n\nECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. \"It's a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,\" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. \"When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn't warranted. So we're not happy at the moment.\" The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.", "11": "LONDON - Banks in the eurozone are now more exposed to government debt than at any time since the financial crisis began, with many increasingly using their balance sheets to prop up ailing governments, deepening the bank-sovereign link that has already pushed a number of countries and lenders into bailouts.\n\nBanks in the region now hold about 1.75 trillion euros in government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to European Central Bank data. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the entire banking system is now on loan to governments.\n\nAlthough the ECB has said it is keen to break what it terms the sovereign-bank nexus, analysts warn that its hands are tied. European governments need - and many encourage - their banks to finance growing public debt piles because many simply do not have enough alternative buyers after an exodus of foreign investors.\n\n\"The sovereign-bank nexus is growing and it is a concern,\" said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan. \"The ECB and regulators want to reduce this risk, but they know they can't right now because the region is only just emerging from a debt crisis. If debt sustainability issues resurface in the future, it will be a problem for heavily exposed banks.\"\n\nSince the 1980s, global banking regulations have enshrined incentives to hold government debt by making it zero risk-weighted. The Basel Committee chose not to change these zero weightings when the rules were last updated in 2010. Fitch said the latest rulebook even \"turbocharges\" previous risk weightings.\n\n\"The reason that government bonds are zero risk-weighted by regulators is partly political; it is not how we weight them in our credit analysis,\" said Bridget Gandy, a bank analyst at Fitch, who added that underdeveloped capital markets often necessitate the bank-sovereign nexus.\n\n\"Somebody has to buy government bonds, and many countries have traditionally leant on their banking systems to do exactly that. Only once a country's capital markets develop, with a healthy insurance and pension sector, do you increase the pool of buyers, and some countries aren't there yet.\"\n\nThe ECB is blamed by many for having facilitated an increase in exposures, providing banks with cheap loans initially at just 1 percent - falling recently to 0.25 percent - which they can pump into government securities that over the past few years have yielded 7 percent and more - in effect an easy profit.\n\nCash-strapped peripheral banks - many of which have been shut out of primary markets - have welcomed the opportunity to plug capital shortfalls, ploughing over half of their net borrowings from the ECB's emergency longer-term refinancing operations facility into bonds, while lending a mere 13% to the real economy, according to JP Morgan figures.\n\nThe carry trade is estimated to be worth between 5 billion euros and 20 billion euros a year to Spanish and Italian banks, with many firms using the trade not only to hide deep losses, but also as a way to build up capital buffers - in effect using ECB funds to save private shareholders from being diluted.\n\nBanks' holdings of government bonds have risen by 355 billion euros - or about 25 percent - since the liquidity injections in late 2011 and early 2012. Banks in fiscally weak countries have increased their purchases the most, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks increasing their holdings by 62 percent, 52 percent and 45 percent respectively.\n\n\"Policymakers say that they need to break this negative feedback loop, but as a side effect, ECB policies have enabled banks to load up on government debt which has furthered the link between banks and their home sovereign,\" said Stefan Best, a bank analyst at Standard & Poor's.\n\n\"The LTRO allowed banks to borrow huge amounts of cash from the central bank at low interest rates and several have used that money to buy government debt to bolster revenues,\" said Best. \"Governments have not objected to them doing this.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that banks have piled into a sovereign-debt-linked carry trade in search of easy money. In the previous decade, many banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank bought billions in Greek debt in order to cash in on the extra yield offered.\n\nThat trade spectacularly backfired when Athens was forced to restructure its private debts, leaving those four banks with multi-billion euro losses and the Greek and Cypriot banking systems in need of mass recapitalizations after organizations bailing out the country decided to impose a haircut on Greek debt.\n\nItaly's debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of last year was 133 percent, higher than the 129 percent that Greece had in the last full year before it asked for a bailout. Spain also has a debt higher than its annual GDP. According to the IMF, there have been 600 cases of sovereign debt restructuring since the 1950s in 95 countries, often with debt levels lower than Spain and Italy.\n\nAlthough banks' exposure to government debt is now lower than in the 1990s, when banks in countries including Belgium and Greece devoted more than 20 percent of their balance sheets to sovereign debt, public debt levels across Europe are much higher today, increasing the risk of a debt restructuring.\n\nIn Spain and Italy, exposures have increased rapidly in recent years. Spanish banks now hold 297 billion euros of government debt, equivalent to 9.4 percent of total industry assets and up from less than 3 percent in late 2008. Italian banks hold 407 billion euros, roughly 10 percent of total assets and up from 4.6 percent in late 2008.\n\nThat growing exposure would increase the risk and cost of mass bank recapitalization in the event of a government debt restructuring.\n\n\"The ECB is keen to reduce this dangerous link but it can't escape the fact that many governments still need banks to buy their debt,\" said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at RBS. \"The purpose of banks isn't to finance their national governments, but they are being encouraged to do precisely that.\" [Reuters]", "12": "The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone\u2019s economy.\n\nEUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair\u2019s strongest since October 2011.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,\u201d Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. \u201cWhen the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn\u2019t warranted. So we\u2019re not happy at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone\u2019s exporters.\n\nLast week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank\u2019s price-stability objective.\n\nOn March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB\u2019s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro\u2019s demand.\n\nThe ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank\u2019s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.\n\nIn February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts\u2019 projections for a 0.7% increase.\n\nAt the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts\u2019 forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January\u2019s 0.8% increase. February\u2019s reading was also the strongest since September.\n\nWhile the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, greenback\u2019s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation\u2019s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn\u2019t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.\n\nThe report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals are good,\u201d Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. \u201cFaster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they\u2019ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the deficit on United States\u2019 trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.\n\nFactors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.\n\nElsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day.

The euro rose in recent days to 1.39 to the dollar, its highest since late 2011, after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.\n\nThe Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but less than 2.0 percent.\n\nNoyer said he did not currently see deflation - what he described as a \u201cpernicious spiral\u201d downward in prices that chokes consumption and investment - in the euro zone and that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in positive territory.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s inflation target was meant to provide a cushion against negative shocks to the economy that could drive inflation lower, Noyer said. The euro zone was vulnerable without a buffer, he said.\n\nAgainst that background, the ECB\u2019s Governing Council has made it explicit that its members expect to keep interest rates at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.\n\nSuch forward guidance is a relatively new tool the ECB has called on to influence the economy. Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates.\n\nBut even with more levers available to central banks than in the past, Noyer warned that there were limits to what monetary policy could do.\n\n\u201cThe longer interest rates are kept at low levels, the greater the risk for financial stability,\u201d he said. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Larry King)", "16": "PARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.\n\n\"The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,\" Mr. Noyer said. \"This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability.\"\n\nA country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.\n\nEuro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.\n\nStill, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.\n\n\"Low inflation is not deflation,\" Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. \"There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages.\"\n\nHe warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.\n\n\"The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks,\" Mr. Noyer said. \"Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking.\"\n\nThe reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.\n\nWrite to Gabriele Parussini at gabriele.parussini@wsj.com", "17": "A deal in the negotiations, set to span three days, would be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for all eurozone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one common pot of money to pay for it.\n\nThe union, and the thorough clean-up of banks\u2019 books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks\u2019 confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.\n\nNew lending has been throttled by banks\u2019 efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone\u2019s own sovereign debt crisis.\n\nPolicymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.\n\nBut talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, there won\u2019t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April.

EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.\n\nGovernments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.\n\nThe fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around \u20ac55bn.", "18": "Fundamental Forecast for Euro: Neutral\n\n- Forex seasonality over the past 20 years favor a stronger EURUSD in March.\n\n- A better than expected February Nonfarm Payrolls report stunted a potential major EURUSD breakout.\n\n- Have a bullish (or bearish) bias on the Euro, but don\u2019t know which pair to use? Use a Euro currency basket.\n\nThe Euro\u2019s resiliency continued to shine this week as a bout of mixed economic data took a backseat to the European Central Bank\u2019s policy meeting on Thursday. On a cooling of tensions in Eastern Europe and seemingly diminished outcome of military conflict, the higher yielding currencies led the pack as risk appetite surged: the EURAUD depreciated by -1.08% and the EURNZD eased by -0.38%. The Euro\u2019s strength came through in the last two days of the week, and its gains elsewhere are constructive going forward.\n\nWhile the ECB\u2019s meeting on Thursday helped the Euro realize its pent up bullish potential, it may have just paved the way for further gains over the coming months. The window in which to ease further may be closing, and as a result, the door to a period of monetary stability may have been opened.\n\nAs ECB President Mario Draghi made clear in the press conference on Thursday, the ECB does not want to simply just inject more liquidity into the Euro-Zone banking system; there is little need right now. Interbank lending rates (EONIA) are stable below the ECB\u2019s overnight reference rate of 0.25%, which means funding stresses are low. Sovereign yields are stable at multi-year lows (bond prices at highs) and equity markets are buoyed; the linkages between the Euro-Zone banking system and her sovereigns are being strained.\n\nWith the PMI surveys pointing to continued modest growth and Euro-Zone inflation starting to tick higher, any new non-standard dovish policies could send the wrong signal as the ECB undertakes role as supervisor of the Euro-Zone banking system; economic data has been generally improved recently, even consumption. As the ECB prepares its stress tests (AQR), announcing a liquidity injections before the results come out might signal to the market that the ECB discovered something unknown and materially negative once they began to review banks' balance sheets.\n\nInstead, so as to prevent unnecessary confusion about the health of the banking system, the ECB is stuck in neutral. To be clear: the ECB stands ready to act if necessary, and quite frankly, it seems that the Governing Council would like to do more. But at present time, short-term economic momentum doesn\u2019t dictate that necessity. This is not inaction; this is a deliberate attempt to do nothing and see where the chips fall. Only if data falls back will the ECB act \u2013 crisis conditions don\u2019t exist.\n\nEventually, a BoE-styled Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) seems like the most palatable outcome for the market is crisis conditions remain absent. This could address credit concerns at the consumer and small business level (SMEs), and it wouldn\u2019t put the Euro at risk of a massive ECB balance sheet expansion that another LTRO or a Fed-styled QE would bring (this would please the German influence). For now, data needs to remain sturdy as the door remains open for further Euro gains. \u2013 CV\n\nTo receive reports from this analyst, sign up for Christopher\u2019s distribution list.", "19": "Follow @csaid\n\nEBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.\n\nThe San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn\u2019s proposed two board nominees.

He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.\n\nThe billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.\n\nThe chairman of eBay\u2019s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because \u201cneither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.\u201d\n\nEBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay\u2019s guidelines on \u201coverboarding.\u201d\n\nEBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company\u2019s slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe.\n\nThe company also said Donahoe\u2019s 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board\u2019s decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay\u2019s weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay.\n\nThe company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.\n\nIcahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.\n\nThe company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.\n\nIn a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of \u201cinexcusable incompetence\u201d and said the fast-growing PayPal could \u201cwither\u201d if it remains part of eBay.\n\n\u201cPayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,\u201d Icahn said.\n\nEBay called Icahn\u2019s comments \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,\u201d eBay said.\n\nEBay shares fell 1.4 percent to $58.22 on the Nasdaq.", "21": "Carl Icahn's assault on Ebay began with the idea that the company's payments business PayPal would be more valuable as a standalone company. It quickly devolved into a war of words with board member Marc Andreessen and Monday morning it took another turn as the billionaire investor put Ebay CEO John Donahoe squarely in his crosshairs.\n\nCriticizing the same Skype transaction he has taken Andreessen to task over, Icahn says Donahoe's \"inexcusable incompetence\" cost EBay shareholders more than $4 billion.\n\n(A quick refresher: EBay sold a stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake that also included Andreessen's venture capital firm. Less than two years later, following the resolution of some intellectual property concerns, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion.)\n\nIcahn's latest barrage reiterates his charge that shareholders got fleeced in a deal that helped line the pockets of a board member for stepping in as middleman. From Monday's letter:\n\nI believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion. via Icahn Letter.\n\nThe letter, which came after Ebay rejected Icahn's proposed board slate Monday, also calls out Donahoe for trailing industry peers. From the start of January until January 10, 2014 -- when Icahn disclosed his investment -- Ebay shares have returned 2% to considerably better returns from Amazon.com (+60%), Visa (+48%) and MasterCard (+73%), the billionaire notes.\n\nIn a response, Ebay touted the 460% increase in its stock since Donahoe's first analyst day five years ago, beating the Nasdaq and overall stock market.\n\n\"John\u2019s track record of success at eBay, driving the company\u2019s turnaround and growth, is well documented,\" the statement continues. \"Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.\"\n\nIcahn, nodding to the original thrust of his case for buying into Ebay, touched on PayPal in Monday's letter, arguing that an independent payments company could be acquired at a rich premium instead of withering within its current corporate structure (a view that has been shared by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, he notes).\n\n\"I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell , Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo , Xerox , Sony , Palm, and AOL \u2013 the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola\u2019s board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies \u2013 ultimately resulting in a sale to Google ,\" says Icahn.\n\nPayPal is facing a battle against some of the biggest companies in the world, Icahn argues, among them Google, Apple and Visa, and the billionaire doesn't think Donahoe is the right guy to lead that charge.\n\n\"To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty,\" he writes. \"Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted \u2013 management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.\"\n\nIn an acknowledgement that to date his case for a PayPal spinoff has largely been the rote argument made in most cases for corporate breakups, Icahn promised to share a case study on why such a move makes sense.\n\nTwo things remain clear: Icahn won't get his way without a fight and Ebay's management and board are going to give him one.\n\nShares of Ebay were down 1.6% to $58.08 Monday morning.\n\nFollow @SchaeferStreet", "22": "SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) \u2014 After taking the weekend off to recuperate, both Carl Icahn and eBay Inc. put their gloves back on Monday and got personal by trading more punches in the ongoing public slugfest between the activist investor and the online retailing giant.\n\nBloomberg News Carl Icahn\n\nBefore the market opened, eBay EBAY, -0.54% filed a preliminary proxy statement calling upon its shareholders to reject Icahn\u2019s two nominees for the e-commerce company\u2019s board of directors at eBay\u2019s next annual meeting.

Today, eBay issued a notice of an upcoming annual meeting, in which the company asked shareholders flat out to vote against Icahn\u2019s proposal to spin off PayPal. Meanwhile, Icahn issued yet another open letter against current eBay management, in which he accused CEO John Donahoe of \u201cinexcusable incompetence\u201d that cost stockholders $4 billion.\n\nCarl Icahn has also proposed adding two employees from the Icahn Group to eBay\u2019s board. (Icahn currently owns 2.15% of eBay as of February 18.) eBay has also asked shareholders to reject that proposal.\n\nOn the subject of new board members, eBay notes: \u201cThe Board of Directors does not endorse any Icahn Group nominee or the Icahn Proposal and unanimously recommends that you vote on the WHITE proxy card or voting instruction form \u2018FOR ALL\u2019 of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors and \u2018AGAINST\u2019 the Icahn Proposal,\u201d Michael R. Jacobson, company secretary, writes in the SEC filing. \u201cThe Board of Directors strongly urges you not to sign or return any proxy card sent to you by the Icahn Group.\u201d\n\nAnd on the subject of the spinoff proposal, it is equally unequivocal: \u201cThe Board has carefully considered this proposal and has unanimously agreed that spinning off the Payments segment (PayPal) into a separately traded public company would not be in the best interests of eBay or its stockholders,\u201d it writes. \u201cThe Icahn Proposal is not a new idea to the Board or the Company. The Board, together with management and external advisers, has assessed a spin-off of PayPal several times and continues to believe that each of the Company\u2019s payments and commerce segments are stronger together than apart and see compelling benefits to keeping them together. Therefore the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST the Icahn Proposal.\u201d\n\nFrom the looks of it, the Icahn letter doesn\u2019t reveal materially any more information than previous statements from the activist investor but it\u2019s mainly about making sure that they continue to have a fresh statement to match those of eBay: it centers specifically on the sale of Skype at what Icahn believed was not a fair price. He claims that Donahoe and his advisers should not have spun off the asset to a consortium that included Andreessen Horowitz, and should have instead settled outstanding intellectual property issues itself and sold the asset directly to Microsoft (or another interested party).\n\neBay has issued statements against these accusations already, and so has Marc Andreessen.\n\neBay and key people associated with the company have also explained why the split does not make sense. eBay has highlighted the synergies between the two companies and also how a lot of PayPal\u2019s growth is supported by eBay; while Reid Hoffman argued convincingly about the choice between short-term profit and long-term value creation.\n\nPayPal has recently started rolling out a new website, and it accounted for around 40% of eBay\u2019s $16 billion in revenues in 2013.\n\nThe timeline so far, as outlined by eBay in its filing today:\n\nOn January 16, 2014, eBay received a notice from the Icahn Group indicating that it intended to nominate two Icahn Group employees to stand for election as directors to the eBay Board of Directors at eBay\u2019s 2014 Annual Meeting. The notice also included a precatory proposal recommending that eBay act expeditiously to engage an investment banking firm to effectuate a spin-off of eBay\u2019s Payments segment into a separately traded company. On January 17, 2014, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Act, to enable the Icahn Group to acquire more than $700 million of eBay\u2019s common stock, including any shares that the Icahn Group may already own. On each of January 17 and January 22, 2014, Carl Icahn and John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, had telephone conversations concerning the Icahn Group\u2019s perspectives on eBay and the upcoming annual meeting. No agreements or understandings resulted from these conversations. On January 22, 2014, in connection with eBay\u2019s earnings release and associated conference call, eBay publicly announced that it had received the notice from the Icahn Group regarding the 2014 Annual Meeting. On February 11, 2014, the Icahn Group delivered to eBay an update to its January 16, 2014 notice that included revised biographical information regarding one of the Icahn Group\u2019s proposed nominees and indicated that the Icahn Group had acquired call options that conferred beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay\u2019s outstanding common stock. On February 18, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the HSR Act waiting period to the Icahn Group. Later that day, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had exercised its call options resulting in the Icahn Group having beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay\u2019s outstanding common stock. On February 22, 2014, Mr. Icahn spoke with Mr. Donahoe by telephone. On February 24, 2014, the Icahn Group issued an \u201copen letter\u201d to eBay stockholders that contained various allegations regarding eBay\u2019s Board and seeking support for the Icahn Proposal. eBay responded later that day with a press release stating that the Board welcomed discussion of the Icahn Proposal and rebutting the allegations contained in the Icahn Group\u2019s letter. On February 26, 2014, the Icahn Group submitted a demand to inspect the Company\u2019s books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cIcahn Demand\u201d) and on February 28, 2014 submitted a demand to inspect certain eBay stocklist materials. eBay subsequently offered by letter to provide the Icahn Group with documents responsive to their Section 220 demands. In early March 2014, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Icahn spoke by telephone and subsequently had an in-person meeting during which additional representatives of both parties were present. Throughout January, February and March, the Icahn Group and the Company published various solicitation materials.\n\nImage: eBay", "24": "New York: EBay Inc. on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn\u2019s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.\n\nIcahn, who owns just over 2% of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business.

The Battle Royale genre is at its peak thanks to H1Z1: King of the Kill. The biggest Twitch streamers were entertaining thousands every weekend closed beta. And a big chunk of King of the Kill\u2019s fanbase was looking for a fresh take on Battle Royale. I know I was.\n\nOriginally posted on 3/27/17\n\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds finally hit Steam Early Access and what we all thought would happen did happen. Developer Bluehole, best known for Tera before last week, scored big.\n\n$11 million+ in revenue. In just three days. That\u2019s more than 360,000 copies sold at $30/each. It\u2019s actually more when you factor in Steam\u2019s cut (30% is the number floating around). Everyone\u2019s favorite source of Steam stats, Steamspy, shows around 235,000 copies (plus/minus 13,800). These Steamspy numbers aren\u2019t set in stone for any game. Think of them as ballpark figures instead. Plus, Battlegrounds was sold via their own website during the closed beta period.\n\n7/9/18 UPDATE\n\nA recent Valve leak of game player counts gives us a very accurate look at PUBG\u2019s total sales on Steam (as of July 1, 2018). According to the data, the number of PUBG Steam owners sits at more than 36,604,134. The data leak was fixed on July 1, so that number is higher by now. Arstechnica dumped the total player count data for more than 13,000 games into a CSV file. Check it out and see where your favorite games stack up.\n\n6/19/18 UPDATE\n\nPUBG has pushed past 50 million units worldwide according to the developer. That\u2019s combined sales between Xbox One and PC. Toss in PUBG Mobile, and there are over 400 million registered PUBG players worldwide. 87+ million log in and play every day across all platforms.\n\nThe devs are celebrating the huge milestones with a PUBG sale. Starting later today through July 5th, you can pick up PUBG for $19.99 ($10 off its usual price).\n\nBluehole also took a portion of the announcement to say \u201cthere\u2019s still so much we can do to make PUBG a better game for our players.\u201d Yep, there are parts of the game that are still frustrating (loot density, performance issues), but damn I love it. Barely a day goes by where I don\u2019t fire PUBG up for at least a match or two.\n\n3/15/18 UPDATE\n\nWe\u2019re almost at a year since I first published this article, and the Battle Royale genre has exploded to heights none of us would ever have imagined. Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite is turning into a cultural phenomenon, but PUBG is still sitting comfortably at the top of Steam. The latest count from SteamSpy shows nearly 33 million owners. We can add another 5 million more after the folks at Xbox announced the milestone. Check out the infographic at the Xbox Wire post for all kinds of chicken dinner stats.\n\n12/7/17 UPDATE\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since the last update. 20 million sales came and went. 8 months after release and PUBG is still showing little signs of slowing up. Sales are now past 24 million. 30 million total copies shouldn\u2019t be too far away with the Xbox One version coming next week.\n\nJust saw that PUBG is up to 24 million units sold. In 8 months.

SteamSpy gives us a look at how the audience breaks down across the world. The US saw a dip recently as the holiday rush of games begins (Destiny 2?). But that dip didn\u2019t even register thanks to the massive surge in popularity in China.\n\nFor example, yes, PUBG did decline a bit in the US lately but it was offset by skyrocketing player base in China and Korea pic.twitter.com/7iIUk5WxBs \u2014 Steam Spy (@Steam_Spy) October 11, 2017\n\nWe don\u2019t often see hard numbers like this for the Chinese audience, but it shows just how big games can be over there.\n\nSales are also up to at least 15.5 million according to SteamSpy.\n\n10/09/17 UPDATE\n\nPUBG continues its meteoric rise as SteamSpy puts its sales at over 14 million. We haven\u2019t received an official sales update in a little while, but the upward trajectory matches the growth in concurrent player numbers. The 2 million milestone will fall any day now. SteamCharts has the peak player count at 1,984,278. That\u2019s more than the peak player numbers for Dota 2, CS:GO, Team Fortress 2, ARK, Rocket League and Warframe combined.\n\n9/26/2017 UPDATE\n\nPUBG success just doesn\u2019t stop. SteamSpy has the total number of owners at 12.2 million, give or take 100,000.\n\nBluehole\u2019s Battle Royale game already crushed the record for concurrent players, but they still have their work cut out for them to become the most owned game on Steam (that isn\u2019t free to play). The top spot belongs to CS:GO with nearly 34 million owners.\n\nAnother crazy stat courtesy of SteamSpy is 76%. That\u2019s the number of total PUBG owners that have played the game in the last two weeks. That\u2019s crazy retention for a game out six months already. Newer games often see retention rates like this, but they tend to fall quickly. Take Divinity: Original Sin 2. 82% of its owners have played in the past two weeks. But that number won\u2019t stay like that for long.\n\nPlayers are not only jumping on the PUBG bandwagon. They\u2019re staying on it.\n\n9/14/2017 UPDATE\n\n11 million+ now. That\u2019s according to SteamSpy, which has been underestimating the official numbers by about a million. Either SteamSpy is getting better at tracking sales or PUBG\u2019s incredible growth is only accelerating. I\u2019m guessing a mix of both. Peak player counts this morning rose over 1.13 million. The once insurmountable DOTA 2 record of 1.29 concurrent players looks likely to fall soon.\n\n9/05/2017 UPDATE\n\n10 million and counting. That\u2019s the latest sales numbers from PlayerUnknown himself.\n\n10 MILLION SOLD! Never did I think we would reach such a number! Thank you all for your continuing support of the @PUBATTLEGROUNDS team <3 \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) September 5, 2017\n\nA quick look at SteamSpy shows the website lagging about one million behind. Peak player numbers continue to grow with 962,950 playing this morning. It\u2019ll be interesting what kind of impact Destiny 2\u2019s launch will have on peak numbers tomorrow and the rest of the week.\n\n8/30/2017 UPDATE\n\nEveryday brings another new peak player count for PUBG. Today, it hit 887,895. SteamSpy puts sales at around 8.5 million copies right now. This number is lagging as it struggles to keep up with the accelerated growth PUBG has seen in the past month. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the real number is at 9 million or past it already.\n\n8/22/2017 UPDATE\n\nSteamSpy can\u2019t keep up with PUBG\u2019s blistering sales rate. Bluehole announced at Gamescom their hit game has already eclipsed 8 million sales. And that\u2019s not even the craziest number. PUBG hit a new peak player record today with 718,978 players. That\u2019s within 70,000 players of DOTA 2.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if PUBG could ever get close to CSGO\u2019s record peak player of 850,000, but it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing down. It\u2019s looking more like a matter of if than when. A stunning success that has to be exceeding even Bluehole\u2019s wildest dreams.\n\n8/16/2017 UPDATE\n\nWell that was fast. SteamSpy puts sales of PUBG at 7 million+. Peak player counts are surging right alongside with a new high of 614,000+. It\u2019s inching ever closer to CS:GO\u2019s 850,000+ high.\n\n8/11/2017 UPDATE\n\nLet\u2019s check in on PUBG. The hottest game out there continues to sell at a blistering rate. SteamSpy pegs the current sales number at around 6.5 million copies. And it\u2019s an engaged audience. Peak player counts are closing in on 580,000. CS:GO has a comfortable hold on the #2 spot for all-time peak players at 850,000. PUBG has its work cut out to dethrone the 1-2 punch of DOTA 2 and CS:GO. At least, for the all-time peak number. PUBG is already starting to eclipse CS:GO in daily peak players. PUBG had 559,613 players earlier today. CS:GO? 520,209 players.\n\n7/28/2017 UPDATE\n\nFolks just can\u2019t seem to get enough of PUBG. Another week, another milestone. 6 million copies have been sold according to developer Bluehole. On top of that, a new concurrent peak is being hit right now with 429,723 people vying for a serving of chicken dinner. I knew Battlegrounds would be popular, but I don\u2019t think anyone thought it would put up these kind of numbers. And Bluehole still hasn\u2019t tapped into the console market yet.\n\nToday\u2019s new concurrent peak puts PUBG within about 40,000 of passing Fallout 4 for the #3 spot on Steam\u2019s all-time top 10.\n\nAnd that $11 million in revenue over its first three days is now around $180 million four months later.\n\n7/17/2017 UPDATE\n\nThe big news today centers around player count. PUBG has passed one of the juggernauts of gaming and now sits with the fourth highest peak player count on Steam. Ever. With 382,561 peak players, PUBG passes GTA V. Only Fallout 4, CSGO and Dota 2 have higher peak player counts.\n\nAgain, your support of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS astounds me! We just surpassed GTAV & achieved the 4th highest peak player count on @steam_games <3 pic.twitter.com/UGtSJX3GYR \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) July 16, 2017\n\nFallout 4 is within reach, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any game challenging CSGO at 850,000+ or Dota 2 at 1.29 million+.\n\nAs for sales numbers? We haven\u2019t heard any recent official numbers, but SteamSpy shows the game closing in on 5 million sales. I knew Battle Royale was popular and loved it on H1Z1, but PUBG\u2019s success is insane. And well deserved. I can\u2019t stop playing it.\n\nBluehole pushed a more polished Battle Royale experience at just the right time, and backed it up with tremendous support. With continuous updates and new maps on the way, PUBG should only continue to grow.\n\n6/22/2017 UPDATE\n\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds just passed 4 million copies. In three months. Fantastic sales for a fantastic game. Congrats to \u2018PlayerUnknown\u2019 and the Bluehole team for delivering a great game and keeping it up with plenty of updates and fixes.\n\n3 months\u2026 4 million copies of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS sold\u2026 Thank you all again for your continuing support <3 \u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) June 22, 2017\n\n6/5/2017 UPDATE\n\nThe playerbase for PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds continues to surge higher. SteamSpy estimates almost 3 million owners for the game. And those buying can\u2019t stop playing Peak concurrent players peaked at 209,081 players over the weekend. That\u2019s just shy of breaking into the top 5 for most peak players ever. No Man\u2019s Sky sits at the fifth spot with 212,321.\n\nDeveloper Bluehole continues to keep fans of the game updated on a day-to-day basis. Updates to fix bugs come every week and monthly updates bring new content and features. Look for another (unannounced) weapon this month. Plus, the team is busy working on two new maps and game modes.\n\nDeveloper support plus a more polished Battle Royale experience than anything on the market right now propelled Battlegrounds near the top of Steam\u2019s charts.\n\n5/20/17 UPDATE\n\nSteamSpy is now showing 2 million owners. We haven\u2019t received an official number since the beginning of the month, but Battlegrounds\u2019 popularity is only growing. Peak player counts are now hitting north of 170,000. Today, 173,386 players were trying to grab chicken dinner at one point. The all-time peak sits at 174,287 players.\n\nDespite the surge in players on Battlegrounds, H1Z1: King of the Kill is proving resilient. It hit just over 124,000 peak players earlier today.\n\nIt\u2019s been crazy watching the growth of the Battle Royale genre over the past year. Last May, H1Z1 was only averaging 8,000 players at any one point. Over the past 30 days, it\u2019s nearly 70,000. For Battlegrounds, it\u2019s just over 96,000.\n\n5/2/17 UPDATE\n\n2 million sales. I can\u2019t imagine how PlayerUnknown and the folks at Bluehole feel passing another milestone. SteamSpy data is lagging a bit as it shows 1,766,374 (plus/minus 36,753). Peak player count is regularly hitting 120,000+. I\u2019ve seen it as high as 140,000 over the past week. A huge success for a great game.\n\n4/27/17 UPDATE\n\nBattlegrounds continues to build on its launch success. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 1,578,332 (plus/minus 36,564). Remember, use these figures as ballpark estimates. Not hard numbers.\n\nThe player rising is rising right alongside the number of owners. We have a Battle Royale near the top of Steam\u2019s top games chart with Battlegrounds and H1Z1 fighting for the 3rd and 4th spot. Right now, 103,254 people are on Battlegrounds. 103,055 are fighting on H1Z1: King of the Kill.\n\nMan, whoever gets their game on console first is going to see a ton more sales. Hell, I would double dip on Xbox One.\n\n4/10/17 UPDATE\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t have reached this amazing milestone without the tremendous support shown by our players and content creators. Thank you all <3 https://t.co/siRiG4CNh0 \u2014 PLAY BATTLEGROUNDS (@PUBATTLEGROUNDS) April 10, 2017\n\nBattlegrounds is showing no signs of slowing down as it breaks 1 million+ copies sold. Huge congrats to the Bluehole team for creating an absolutely awesome experience. SteamSpy puts the owners at 916,186 (plus/minus 27,819). Peak concurrent players is pushing 90,000 daily.\n\n4/4/17 UPDATE\n\nBattlegrounds continues its impressive launch. According to SteamSpy, the number of owners now sits at 679,209 (plus/minus 23,031). Peak daily players are up 74,000.\n\nOriginal story continues below.\n\n150,000 Twitch viewers at times. King of the Kill was already a popular game among many of the top streamers. A lot of them moved over to Battlegrounds at launch. More than 3,600 Twitch streams have entertained countless viewers. A look at it right now shows nearly 100,000 viewers in the early afternoon. Only League of Legends has more viewers.\n\nYou can see King of the Kill slipped out of the top 10 on Twitch right now.\n\n67,000+ concurrent players. That\u2019s enough to get PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds into the top 10 on Steam\u2019s most played games. Up there with the likes of Dota 2, CSGO, King of the Kill, GTA and Rocket League.\n\nWhile the game\u2019s launch has been incredibly impressive, H1Z1 is still hitting higher concurrent players. Today, King of the Kill hit nearly 110,000 players at one point. We\u2019ll see how the tug of war between the Battle Royale giants shake out over the coming weeks and months.\n\nDon\u2019t expect H1Z1 to go down quietly. Yes, the game is stale for some \u2013 but evidently not for many. It weathered the launch of Battlegrounds better than I thought it would. Still, Daybreak Games has to be feeling pressure from Bluehole. Battlegrounds strengths are King of the Kill\u2019s biggest weaknesses. Weapon variety, the map and gunplay are all better on Battlegrounds.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Battlegrounds doesn\u2019t have its share of issues. The biggest one right now is the servers. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but rubberbanding is an issue. And there are performance issues on certain areas of the map.\n\nBluehole is addressing these performance issues and plans to release patches to fix them. Here\u2019s what the dev had to say in a recent blog post.\n\nOne important thing to note. Client optimization takes time, and will not be solved in one single patch. We will be working hard over the next 6 months to ensure all players enjoy smooth gameplay with no lag or FPS drops.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how they do. For me, Battlegrounds is running fantastic. Outside of the server issues I mentioned above, I haven\u2019t run into any problems. I know that might not be the case for everyone, but the devs seem committed to getting the game running great across a variety of PC and settings.\n\nDid you pick up PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds?

The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald\u2019s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.\n\n\u201cWeather was definitely an impact in the month of February \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a drag on everybody,\u201d Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald\u2019s, he said.\n\n\u201cThe other players from Wendy\u2019s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they\u2019re taking back some share,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shares fell 0.2% to $95.35 at 8:30 a.m. in early trading in New York. McDonald\u2019s slumped 1.6% this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7%.\n\nPressuring Margins\n\nLittle-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.\n\nWhile U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands Inc.\u2019s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it\u2019s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.\n\nEuropean Sales\n\nSame-store sales rose 0.6% in Europe and fell 2.6% in the company\u2019s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1% and 1.1 %, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne, New Jersey. Same-store sales declined 8.7% in Japan last month.\n\nIn February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a \u201cstrong performance\u201d in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald\u2019s said.\n\nComparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer\u2019s performance because they include only older, established locations. McDonald\u2019s has about 35,400 restaurants worldwide and 81% of those are franchised.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 22.", "36": "In a near repeat of January\u2019s results, February same-store sales for McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) U.S. stores fell and the company\u2019s global sales were rescued by sales in Europe. U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, while sales in Europe rose 0.6% and sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) fell 2.6%. Overall global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, compared with sales in February 2013.\n\nThat is much worse than the January performance, where global same-store sales were up 1.2%, even though U.S. sales were down 3.3%. Europe and APMEA both grew sales in January by 2% and 5.4%, respectively, to offset the big decline in the United States.\n\nU.S. sales were down due to \u201cchallenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.\u201d APMEA sales fell as a result of weaker sales in Japan, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday and negative performance in Australia. The United Kingdom and France offset weaker sales in Germany to post a slight gain in European sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s CFO noted that year-to-date performance \u201cwill pressure margins in the first quarter.\u201d That is not good news for shareholders.\n\nWhat is even worse news is that the company\u2019s priorities do not appear to be having a significant positive impact on sales. In the fourth quarter of 2013, same-store sales fell 0.1% and consolidated net income was flat. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% while rising 1% in Europe and falling by 2.4% in Asia. That is just about where the stores are at the end of February, and that is why the CFO is hinting that profits appear to be headed to finish no better than flat in the first quarter of this year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s shares were down about 0.2% in premarket trading Monday, at $95.25 in a 52-week range of $92.22 to $103.70.", "37": "What a difference five years makes.\n\nFive years ago Sunday, the stock market indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007, when it had soared to 1,565.15.\n\n* Download the above chart in full-size\n\nToday, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than 1,875.\n\nMany of our local companies have enjoyed a similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have soared and dividends have increased in many cases.\n\nThe chart below looks at the total five-year return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and income including dividends.\n\nSo if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $28,380.\n\nIf you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M. Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about $3,000 today.\n\nIn some cases, the fabulous returns are a reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008 and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has done since then.\n\nLikewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years.\n\nIn other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence, the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19 percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded.\n\nIn the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in 2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.\n\nThe five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.", "38": "New York: Global stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nChina\u2019s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China\u2019s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.\n\nThe data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday\u2019s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.\n\nChina\u2019s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.\n\n\u201cThe weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,\u201d said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.\n\nPrices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.\n\nThe commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.\n\nIn the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662.

The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.\n\nIn the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.\n\nAdding to the pressure was China\u2019s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year\u2019s levels.\n\nThe Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters\n\nMarc Jones in London and Sam Forgione and Richard Leong in New York also contributed to this story.", "39": "Today, the stock market opened lower on fears of global economic sluggishness, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) falling 72 points as of 12:30 p.m. EDT and the S&P 500 declining from Friday's record close. Yet in light of the longer-term trends that helped the Dow's bull market reach the ripe old age of 5 yesterday, many investors are looking forward to the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season for signals about whether the blue-chip index has further to climb in the months and years ahead.\n\nWill winter ever end?\n\nThe main storyline that most investors have followed closely during the first quarter is the impact of harsh winter weather on the economy. Already we've seen countless companies cite weather problems to justify sluggish results, with even major producers citing issues that could hurt first-quarter earnings. For instance, automaker Ford (NYSE:F) said last week that delays in fleet orders due to the winter weather played a sizable role in the company's overall 6% drop in total sales in February from year-ago levels. Many retailers have issued similar warnings, with the latest earnings insight report [opens PDF] from FactSet revealing that 86 companies in the S&P 500 have given negative guidance on first-quarter earnings per share.\n\nOn the whole, earnings growth for the first quarter is now seen coming in at just 0.5%, down from expectations of 4.4% at the beginning of the year. Consumer-discretionary stocks such as Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have seen some of the biggest downward revisions, with GM cutting its earnings estimates nearly in half. Among S&P sectors, only utilities have seen higher expected earnings growth, and those stocks obviously aren't included in the Dow Industrials. Yet in the past, a recurring theme has played itself out over and over again: earnings expectations fall in the period leading up to the time at which companies actually start to report results, but then companies are able to beat those modest expectations, sending actual earnings growth higher by the end of earnings season.\n\nFrom that perspective, the early reporting companies in the Dow will have a lot of insight to give to investors. Nike (NYSE:NKE) reports next week, and investors expect to see a substantial rise in sales accompanied by a slight decline in earnings from year-ago levels. Those results would be very much in line with what retailers reported recently, as heavy promotional activity has hurt margins. Even though Nike's strong brand value should help it maintain revenue growth more easily than some competitors, even the athletic-apparel giant has to deal with shoppers who don't want to venture into the cold.\n\nBank stocks will also be among the earliest to issue earnings numbers, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) slated to report on April 11. Banks will have lower hurdles to overcome, as investors already expect headwinds from falling levels of mortgage refinancing to have substantial year-over-year impacts on earnings. Yet housing has been relatively resilient so far, raising the hope that new-purchase mortgages can pick up the slack and help boost overall earnings. With financial stocks among the leaders of the latest push up for the Dow, JPMorgan and its peers need to deliver on their promise in order to keep the bull market going.\n\nAre markets too expensive?\n\nThe other question earnings season should help answer is whether the Dow has simply risen too far. After such strong gains since 2009, concerns about extreme valuations for stocks have risen to new heights. Yet in driving prices higher, earnings have also posted substantial gains, with forward earnings estimates almost doubling since the 2009 lows. Indeed, FactSet noted that current forward multiples are actually below their 15-year average, albeit with that period including not only inflated late-1990s projections but also the boom markets of the mid-2000s.\n\nThose who would like the 5-year-old bull market to reach its next birthday hope that earnings can keep growing enough to satisfy gun-shy investors who grow more nervous at every new record high. First-quarter earnings season will reveal some useful secrets in determining whether the Dow can keep climbing or whether investors should brace for tough times ahead.", "40": "The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Monday, with sentiment suggesting nervousness of traders amid a lack of clarity due to the absence of any major domestic catalysts.

The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.\n\n\n\nFor a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article\n\n\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday's trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares.

The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.\n\n\n\nThe new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom's decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.\n\n\n\nComing back to Friday's events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.\n\n\n\nThis report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve's next possible move following better jobs data.

The Dow (^DJI) closed at just under 6,500 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended at 676.5. Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?\n\nNo one knows the answer, of course, but there are reasons to be cautious. Here are five of them:\n\n1. Tenure: The average bull market lasts about 4.5 years. Only three of the 11 previous bull markets (excluding this one), celebrated a sixth birthday.\n\n2. Valuation: Profit growth is slowing and revenue growth is sluggish, but the price-to-earnings-ratio for the S&P 500 is still strong--about 16 times earnings for the past 12 months. That's near the peak reached in October 2007, just before stocks began their decline during the financial crisis.\n\n3. Margin debt: It's been rising since June and reached a record $488 billion in January. Investors are borrowing to invest, which is a euphoric sign, says Phil Pearlman, interactive editor at Yahoo Finance. And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability. But Pearlman notes that a major reason for rising margin debt is that the cheap cost of borrowing due to extremely low interest rates.\n\n4. The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally. Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.\n\n5. Biotech weakening. Pearlman says biotech stocks have been a leader in the bull market but have been selling off lately. Over the past two weeks the Nasdaq Biotech index (IBB) has fallen 2.3% while the Nasdaq has gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 and Dow are both up about 2%.\n\n\n\nBiotechs have been lagging big-cap growth stocks like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Priceline (PCLN) and Netflix (NFLX), which have also outperformed in the current rally, says Pearlman. \"Keep an eye on biotechs and large-cap growth stocks,\" he warns. \"When they [both] start to roll over that would be a second signal that momentum is waning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow The Daily Ticker on Facebook and Twitter (@DailytTcker)!\n\nMore from The Daily Ticker\n\nGet ready for a bigger push in Washington to raise the minimum wage\n\nJobs better-than-expected but \"the labor market is still weak\": NYT's Greenhouse\n\n'Bond King' tarnishes his crown: Gross is undermining PIMCO, Macke says", "50": "Tara Clarke: The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.\n\nSubprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes, including the top two spots.\n\nAfter the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 \u2013 a little under 18 months later.\n\nU.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.\n\nSince that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).\n\nIn fact, as of this week, the bull market \u2013 defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more \u2013 ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group research.\n\nHowever, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction \u2013 defined as a decline of 10% or more.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about a correction right now,\u201d Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. \u201cThe past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air \u2013 every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around.\u201d\n\nHere are the three signs that have investors worried we\u2019re due for a stock market crash or correction soon\u2026\n\nFirst, many investors are nervous about the duration of this bull market.\n\nMost last from 50 to 67 months. The bull market that began in 1982 lasted about 60 months before the 1987 stock market crash. The bull market that began in 2002 lasted 60 months to a high in 2007.\n\nAnd eerily, yesterday (Thursday), our current bull market hit its 60-month anniversary. The past two bull markets were immediately followed by crushing bear markets, and 2009\u2019s fallout was the biggest since the Great Depression.\n\nSecond, investors are nervous about the lack of market correction.\n\nA market correction hasn\u2019t happened since October 2011 \u2013 that\u2019s a 29-month stretch.\n\nHistorically, corrections occur every 18 months, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\n\u201cThe longer we go without resetting the dial, the greater the likelihood of a steeper correction, and the greater likelihood that it becomes a bear market,\u201d S&P Capital IQ chief equity strategist Sam Stovall said to USA Today.\n\nThe third and final sign making investors wary of a stock market crash is U.S. Federal Reserve action. Since initiating its quantitative easing (QE) program in 2008, the Fed has managed to plump its balance sheet to somewhere over $4 trillion.\n\nIn December 2013, the Fed announced its intent to begin unwinding QE by tapering its monthly bond purchases. Since January, the Fed has cut its bond buying by $10 billion a month (to $75 billion).\n\nThat tapering is likely to negatively impact equity markets as fewer U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are purchased each month.\n\nEven though investors may give pause to the possibility of a stock market crash or correction, they should nonetheless stay invested \u2013 just with caution.\n\n\u201cYou have to be in it to win it. I am urging people to raise stops and play very conservatively right now. But, do stay ready to buy,\u201d Fitz-Gerald said. \u201cGoing forward, look to financials, tech, healthcare, and defense stocks.\u201d\n\nWritten By Tara Clarke From Money Morning\n\nWe\u2019re in the midst of the greatest investing boom in almost 60 years.

The Dow Jones industrial average (NYSE:DIA) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and NASDAQ (NYSE:QQQ) handily. In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.\n\nSmaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time. My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time.\n\nThis might be one of those times.\n\nThe epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again. Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.\n\nTo anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener. The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily). Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.\n\nDuring that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery. Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy. They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind. On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.\n\nGiven what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business. The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.", "52": "Last week was another week where four out of five major equity averages achieved new all-time or multiyear intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (1,6452.72) was the exception still lagging its all-time high at 1,6588.25 on Dec. 31.\n\nThe S&P 500 (1,878.04) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (7,592.36) set new all-time intraday highs at 1883.57 and 7627.44 respectively on Friday.\n\nAs U.S. Treasury yields rose last week, the Dow Utility Average (514.39) lost its leadership slipping into second place year-to-date with a gain of 4.8% down from 5.7% the prior week.

This stock could not sustain gains above its 200-day simple moving average at $5.08 and its 50-day SMA is $4.78.\n\nCirrus Logic continues to be actively traded by my methodology. On January 28 a second position in this stock was removed from the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to sell strength to $19.67 for a gain of 7.7%. This position re-entered the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my annual value level at $18.84 on March 3.\n\nThe stock still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine with a one-year price target at $20.41. This week\u2019s value level is $18.54 with an annual pivot at $18.84, an annual pivot at $20.72 and monthly risky level at $23.41. Cirrus is above its 50-day SMA at $19.08 but below its 200-day SMA at $20.19. The weekly chart is positive with Friday\u2019s close above its five-week modified moving average at $19.00 with its 200-week SMA at $21.46.\n\nOur string of winning trades that go back to mid-September came to an end last week when Big Lots (BIG) and Coca Cola (KO) were removed from the model portfolio due to downgrades to hold from buy according to ValuEngine.

I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.\n\nLet me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.\n\n1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.\n\nUnfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.\n\nWhy get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.\n\n2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week\n\nI've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.\n\nMy second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.\n\n3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates\n\nSome stocks are just flat-out better than others.\n\nmagicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.\n\nAnother thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!\n\nOne of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.\n\nQuarter EPS Estimate EPS Surprise Q4 2012 $0.60 $0.95 58% Q1 2013 $0.51 $1.17 129% Q2 2013 $0.32 $0.49 53% Q3 2013 $0.42 $0.48 14%\n\nThings can change, of course. Analysts are starting to catch up as the strength of the bottom-line beats have weakened in each of the past two quarters. This is a competitive market, and it bears pointing out that analysts see magicJack VocalTec earning less than half as much as it did a year earlier.\n\nIt's still hard to argue against the trend. Everything seems to be falling into place for another market-thumping quarter on the bottom line.", "67": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) may not be knocking off new all-time highs on a daily basis like the broader market S&P 500, but it is once again with striking distance of a new high as it's rebounded ferociously off its beginning-of-the-year swoon.\n\nHelping the Dow move decisively higher has been a steady recovery in the U.S. economy, aided by a double-digit rise in home prices, a precipitous fall in the unemployment rate, improving worker productivity, and the continuation of historically low lending rates.\n\nBut are things really as they appear?\n\nTwo months ago we looked at three variables that may be inflating how strong the U.S. economy actually looks. The first is the labor participation rate, which has been falling consistently for the past 14 years. Some of this drop is expected as baby boomers hit their retirement age and others go back to school, but a growing concern is that some people have simply given up on finding work. Comparing the current number of employed workers with those in mid-2008, you'd see that job creation is basically flat.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus, QE3, has been a boost for the housing and banking sector, but has spoiled the U.S. consumer by keeping rates too low for too long, By artificially keeping rates low and reducing this sense of urgency, consumers have drastically cut back on loan originations anytime lending rates tick up in the slightest.\n\nFinally, a combination of stock buybacks and cost-cutting has helped push corporate earnings higher, but it's also masking what has generally been weak organic growth.\n\nWith these points in mind, I suggest we do what we do every month, which is to take a closer look at the Dow's five most hated companies -- in essence, the five stocks with the highest level of short interest -- to better understand what characteristics, if any, are attracting short-sellers so we can avoid buying similar stocks in the future.\n\nHere are the Dow's five most hated stocks.\n\nCompany Short Interest As a % of Outstanding Shares Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) 5.96% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 4.20% AT&T 3.29% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 2.90% IBM (NYSE:IBM) 2.58%\n\nCaterpillar\n\nWhy are investors shorting Caterpillar?\n\nThe bet against heavy-duty machinery manufacturer Caterpillar has grown dramatically within just the past month, rising from 3.46% last month to 5.96% this month. The reason for the recent run higher was its sizable earnings beat in the fourth quarter, which was a complete surprise after Caterpillar had lowered its earnings guidance on three separate occasions last year. Short-sellers are betting that this past quarter, which was aided primarily by cost-cutting, was nothing more than a fluke, and that weak mining demand will continue to weigh on Caterpillar's share price.\n\nIs this short interest warranted?\n\nWith Caterpillar's management remaining cautious in 2013 and not exactly knowing when this protracted downtrend in heavy-duty machinery would end, I'd suggest that a high level of skepticism could be warranted, at least in the interim. Over the long run, Caterpillar is well positioned globally and has incredible pricing and brand power, which should translate into decades of growth potential, especially in emerging markets. Over the near term, though, stagnant commodity prices could put a cap on any upside in Caterpillar's share price and play right into the hands of short-sellers.\n\nIntel\n\nWhy are investors shorting Intel?\n\nThe bet against Intel hasn't changed in more than a year now, with pessimists counting on Intel's PC processing business to slowly shrink, and for the company to have to spend heavily on research and development to play catch-up with regard to mobile processing and the cloud. The end result has been stagnant top- and bottom-line growth for Intel, which short-sellers suspect will weigh on Intel's share price.\n\nIs this short interest warranted?\n\nPessimists do have a point about continued PC declines, with research firm IDC upping its estimate this past week from an expected 3.8% decline in 2014 to 6.1%. Furthermore, IDC anticipates that PC sales will decline through 2018.While that's not good news for Intel, what is good news is that it'll still be able to generate significant cash flow from its dominant position as the processing king of PCs to fund its mobile and cloud-based R&D. Intel has already shown small snippets of success in penetrating the mobile tablet market and should be a major player in cloud-based hardware by the end of the decade. I believe you'd be doing yourself a disservice by writing off Intel here.\n\nAT&T\n\nWhy are investors shorting AT&T?\n\nThe reason short-sellers have piled into AT&T has nothing to do with poor results. It merely has to do with the risk-on investing approach we're witnessing throughout the market that has traders cycling out of traditionally defensive names like AT&T, which grows at very slow but steady rate, and instead focusing on seeking out riskier but higher-growth investments. In addition, relative to Verizon, AT&T is trailing in 4G LTE-capable cities, meaning it'll have to spend bountifully if it hopes to catch its main rival. 4G LTE is a strong lure in the U.S. to gaining new smartphone subscribers.\n\nIs this short interest warranted?\n\nSomehow this short trade has indeed worked for pessimists over the past year, but I doubt it'll work over the long run. Sectorwide consolidation should help tighten AT&T's costs (AT&T is purchasing Leap Wireless), and mobile devices have practically become necessity products for much of today's consumers. What this means for AT&T is steady cash flow, a healthy dividend that's currently yielding 5.8%, and few reasons to bet against the company.\n\nVerizon\n\nWhy are investors shorting Verizon?\n\nAlthough telecom giants Verizon and AT&T switched spots this month, with AT&T leapfrogging Verizon in a bad way, the story is almost exactly the same for both. Like AT&T, Verizon bears a high number of short-sellers because it's generally a slower-growth business model that simply won't be able to keep up with the double-digit growth traders are witnessing in the networking and cloud-tech space. As investors cycle out of these defensive names, they tend to slowly tick lower.\n\nIs this short interest warranted?\n\nLet me be clear that I don't think betting against AT&T or Verizon is a smart idea, but with the recent acquisition of its remaining unowned interest in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone, coupled with its sizable lead in rolling out 4G LTE-capable networks across the U.S., Verizon makes even less sense than AT&T to bet against. Verizon is paying out a premium 4.4% yield, and at 12 times forward earnings it looks ripe as a possible buy, if you ask me.\n\nIBM\n\nWhy are investors shorting IBM?\n\nAre you noticing the major tech bias on this list of the Dow's most hated companies? No. 2 through No. 5 are all tech or telecom based! IBM finds its way onto this list for many similar reasons as Intel. IBM has seen its hardware division get whacked by weakening demand, and, like Intel, has had to beef up its R&D spending to develop new cloud-based products. Pessimists believes that Big Blue may simply have fallen too far behind not to see its EPS erode in the near-term.\n\nIs this short interest warranted?", "68": "Ukraine and Russia were the talk of the markets this week and made for some wild trading. Stocks were down big Monday when tensions increased, but Tuesday was one of the best days of the year, and by the end of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 0.80%.\n\nRussia is the world's largest oil producer, so it's worth keeping an eye on how it handles Ukraine and the region of Crimea, but the harsh drop of Russian stocks and the ruble on Monday may have been the warning it needed to not escalate the conflict. Russia's economy is on fragile ground, and markets showed that they'd crush Russian assets if a military conflict erupts.\n\nWhile Russia garnered headlines, it was financial stocks that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher this week. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the top stock, gaining 4.7%. Outside of hiring Apple's retiring CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for its board of directors, there wasn't a lot of news out about Goldman this week. Goldman continues to benefit from the strong market for underwriting stock and bond offerings, and as long as the economy continues to improve, the finance giant will fare well.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose 4.5% this week and settled another lawsuit. The company agreed to pay $400 million to Syncora Guarantee to settle mortgage-backed-securities lawsuits. The bond insurer was claiming JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of loans in securitized and therefore increased liabilities to Syncora. This is on top of $23 billion in fines and settlements last year, but thus far it's done little to slow down JPMorgan's stock.\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) was up 2.8% to round out the top three stocks this week. Again, there was little significant news, but the slowly improving economy is helping revenue and earnings as consumers spend more money. The other advantage American Express has is that it more heavily targets affluent consumers than its rivals do. Those consumers are doing well in this economy, which will bode well for American Express long-term.", "69": "It's been five years since the stock market hit its low point of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nWhile the current bull market is already longer than average, most market strategists expect stocks to have another good year in 2014. Stocks gained last week, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs, despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1% away from its all-time high.\n\nBut with little economic and corporate earnings news on tap this week, it may be tough for stocks to move much higher. So instead of our usual preview of the days ahead, we've decided to take a look back at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks of the past five years.\n\nRelated: Extreme greed is driving the market\n\nOnline travel companies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years.\n\nFast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including Chipotle (CMG), Whole Foods (WFM) and Starbucks (SBUX). Wynn Resorts (WYNN), the casino company, and Netflix (NFLX) were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%.\n\nBig tech companies Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. Ford (F) and Delta Airlines (DAL), two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&P 500's gain of nearly 180%.\n\nBut there were a few stocks that have been left behind.\n\nAvon Products (AVP), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) were big laggards. Best Buy (BBY), which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years.\n\nAnd a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of Staples (SPLS), which recently announced plans to close hundreds of stores, have fallen. First Solar (FSLR) shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser.", "70": "NEW YORK (AP):\n\nThe current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the United States (US) government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.\n\nDespite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ.

In January, the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to secede and join Russia. President Obama and other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.\n\nYet stocks recovered and the S&P 500 closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.\n\nThere have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest stretched for almost a decade, October 1990 to March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4\u00bd years, making the current one longer than average.\n\nThe last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was beginning. The S&P 500 fell 57 percent \u2014 from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009 \u2014 before bottoming at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically, bull markets end when investors are spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving, and consumer confidence is rising.\n\nInflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it raises interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.\n\nBut with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero.\n\nStock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next 12 months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, is 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.\n\nThe stock market is \u2018\u2018not cheap, but it\u2019s not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,\u2019\u2019 Manley says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent.

Fidelity\u2019s money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent.", "73": "Happy birthday, bull market.\n\nIf that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven\u2019t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I\u2019m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we\u2019re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.\n\nI\u2019d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then \u2013 the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends \u2013 but that\u2019s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.\n\nRelated: Confident Market Remains Watchful for Ukraine Disruption\n\nOf course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s not easy to follow Warren Buffett\u2019s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence \u2013 a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks \u2013 has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.\n\nWhatever the reason for the average investor\u2019s reluctance to load up on stocks, it\u2019s clear they haven\u2019t benefitted as much from the market\u2019s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve \u2014 about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains.\n\nLet\u2019s put to one side the vexing question of whether that\u2019s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market\u2019s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed \u2013 most dramatically during the course of 2013 \u2013 but personal earnings and profits didn\u2019t.\n\nBy the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon, it was already 2013. The lion\u2019s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.\n\nThe question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It\u2019s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth. And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It\u2019s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re about to careen off the edge of a cliff \u2013 clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market\u2019s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so \u2013 and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "74": "Happy 5th birthday, Mr. Bull Market -- it seems like only yesterday that you sprang from the loins of a dying Bear. Yet, on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) put in its crisis low of 676.53. Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.\n\nSeven days earlier, troubled insurer AIG had reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Two days after that, General Motors disclosed to its shareholders in its annual report that \"there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern\" (the company was ultimately restructured under bankruptcy protection.) On March 9, the CBOE Volatility Index (VOLATILITYINDICES:^VIX), or VIX, which is sometimes referred to as Wall Street's \"fear index,\" closed at 49.68 -- it has not closed above that since then.\n\nWhat did we know then?\n\nInstead of imminent doom, however, investors might have anticipated that, barring outright economic collapse, there was a decent chance that stocks would perform reasonably well over the next five years (though the market's actual performance has exceeded what one could have hoped for).\n\nWhy?\n\nValuations. On March 9, the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, stood at just 11.9 -- cheaper than it had been at any point since 1986 (the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric popularized by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, compares stock prices to an average of inflation-adjusted earnings per share over a trailing-10-year period).\n\nAnd so it was that the fear and revulsion that brought low risky assets in general, and equities in particular, set the foundations for a stunning bull market:\n\nFor the S&P 500 (blue line), which now boasts a 178% price return, a triple is almost in sight, if not immediately within reach. Note that the broad market, as represented by the Wilshire 5000 index (orange line) has done even better, thanks to the huge outperformance of small-capitalization stocks; the Russell 2000 (red line) has well more than tripled over the past five years. (Although the S&P 500 is the most widely used measure of the market's performance, it's technically a large-capitalization index.)\n\nWhere do we go now?\n\nBut where do those gains leave valuations today and what does that augur for returns over the next five years?\n\nAs of Friday's close, the S&P 500 now sports a corpulent CAPE of 25.6, going from a 27% discount to its long-term historical average five years ago, to its current 55% premium. That puts the CAPE into the highest 10% of its values over its entire history going back to 1881.\n\nAs hedge fund manager Cliff Asness observed in a November 2012 paper, historically, when the CAPE is within the top decile of its values, subsequent stock market returns are mediocre, with a 10-year real return that has averaged just 0.5% on an annualized basis (it's important to note, however, that the range of returns is very wide, varying from (6.3%) to +6.1%).\n\nLast month, another well-regarded value investor, James Montier of GMO, published a white paper describing two methods to forecast real returns over the next seven years based on the CAPE. The more optimistic estimate called for an annualized return of just +0.8%, while the more pessimistic produced a (3.2%) loss! Those ought to be sobering figures, particularly for individual investors who have only now begun to drink directly from the equity market punchbowl.\n\nWith the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying? My answer is \"no.\" As my Foolish colleague Morgan Housel has highlighted, the CAPE isn't perfect (though I would argue it's the best metric we have) and even with a high starting CAPE value, the range of outcomes in terms of performance is very wide. As Cliff Asness points out:\n\nI would, if trading on a tactical outlook, give the Shiller P/E some small weight, particularly when it's above 30 or below 10. But I think this type of analysis is most useful not for a trading strategy but to set reasonable expectations.\n\nIf you are a \"know-nothing\" investor (there is no shame in this -- it's the path almost every investor should adopt), the lesson is to temper one's expectations for future stock market returns -- the next five years are unlikely to mirror the past five and they could end up being very disappointing relative to stocks' historical average return (roughly 6.5% per annum, after inflation). Still, if you have an equity-appropriate time horizon, you can continue to put money into a low-cost index fund at regular intervals.\n\n2 values in a heated market\n\nIf you have some skill, experience, and time -- and the inclination to pick individual stocks -- know that it's becoming increasingly difficult to ferret out names that trade at a discount to (or even at) their intrinsic value. However, there are still some values out there. Take the insurance sector, for example: MetLife (NYSE:MET), the No. 1 publicly traded life insurer in the U.S., is a wonderful franchise, yet it is valued at less than 9.5 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- a significant discount to the overall market. Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.\n\nAnother insurance-related name, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), looks reasonably priced. In his recently released annual letter to shareholders, CEO Warren Buffett wrote that stock repurchases at 120% of book value \"benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount.\" On Friday, Berkshire's shares closed at 136% of book value. My sense is that when Buffett refers to a \"meaningful amount,\" it's more than the difference by which 136 exceeds 120.\n\nWhen it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance. Right now, the U.S. stock market doesn't look particularly cheap, and while that tells us nothing about the market's direction in the near term, it's an anchor on performance over the medium to long term. Just as investors who extrapolated bear market losses into the future five years ago were wrong, those who extrapolate similar gains to those achieved over the past five years could well be making the same mistake today.", "75": "Text size\n\nSweet, well behaved one day, an unruly hellion the next? It's about what you'd expect from a 5-year-old.\n\nAnd so it has been recently with the stock market, which marks the fifth anniversary on March 9 of its bear-market lows, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index touched 666, the mark of the Devil from the Book of Revelation, following a near-biblical set of plagues loosed on the financial system and the world economy in 2007-08. Since that time, the S&P 500 has come roaring back by 175% in round numbers, in what might be the best bull market money can buy.\n\nThe pattern continued last week, when stocks swooned on Monday in reaction to the movement of Russian troops in Crimea, only to come roaring back on Tuesday. Then, it became apparent that Vladimir Putin didn't see the need to get into a shooting match, especially when the Russian stock market lost an estimated $58 billion the previous day, even more than the massive $51 billion tab for the Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nThe slide in the ruble also accelerated, forcing the Russian central bank to expend upward of an estimated $12 billion of its reserves to defend the currency, in addition to hiking short-term interest rates sharply. But by week's end, Putin hadn't backed down, and Russian troops were still in Crimea, notwithstanding President Barack Obama's demand that they leave and U.S. threats of sanctions.\n\nThe S&P 500 managed on Friday to eke out a gain of a point to mark the bull's birthday with yet another record. More importantly, the five-year advance has increased the value of investors' holdings in U.S. equities by some $16 trillion, according to Wilshire Associates.\n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve reported last week that U.S. households' net worth surged nearly $3 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, to a record $80.6 trillion -- some $11.8 trillion above the $68.8 trillion reached in the second quarter of 2007, notes David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. Pacing the gains in the latest quarter were corporate stocks, up $1.3 trillion, and real estate, up $456 billion.\n\nBased on those results, it would seem the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet -- to more than $4 trillion from less than $1 trillion prior to the full fury of the financial crisis starting in September 2008 -- has paid handsomely. As Rosenberg previously noted in this space, there has been a more than 90% correlation between the growth of the central bank's assets and the S&P 500 since the bull market began five years ago.\n\nWhat's less recognized is the impact that the Fed's quantitative easing has had on interest rates. Perhaps that's because, despite the massive purchases of Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, the benchmark 10-year T-note yield ended the week at 2.79% -- all of four basis points lower than the 2.83% five years earlier.\n\nThe real decline has been in private borrowing costs, which is reflected in the collapse in risk spreads on corporate bonds, both investment grade and high yield. High-grade bond spreads have plunged to about 125 basis points over comparable Treasuries, from 600 basis points in March 2009 and 850 basis points at the peak of the crisis in late 2008. Junk spreads have shriveled to about 400 basis points -- which hardly qualifies as \"high yield\" any more -- from more than 1,800 basis points five years ago and nearly 2,200 basis points in late 2008.\n\nThat has been a key element in the equity bull market, allowing quality companies to borrow billions for next to nothing, which they can return to shareholders as dividends or share repurchases, or use to make mega-acquisitions. Think Verizon Communications ' (ticker: VZ) recent purchase of Vodafone s' (VOD) stake in Verizon Wireless, which was funded in part by the biggest U.S. corporate bond offering ever last year, totaling some $49 billion.\n\nTo be sure, financial engineering abetted by the Fed's QE also has had real effects. Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities U.S. chief economist, notes that the central bank's actions allowed auto makers to resume offering cut-rate car loans, which has boosted auto demand to precrisis levels. Institutional investors' access to inexpensive debt helped them scoop up large numbers of single-family homes to rent out, while individuals with top credit scores could avail themselves of record-low mortgages rates, helping to clear the housing market.\n\nTHE FED IS ON TRACK to wind down its bond purchases and is widely expected to trim another $10 billion from its current $65 billion-a-month pace at the March 18-19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Various officials, from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on down, have indicated it would take a lot to depart from the tapering path embarked upon late last year. The February employment data released on Friday did nothing to alter that.\n\nNotwithstanding the wicked winter weather that was expected to hurt the numbers, nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000, a bit better than the forecasts, while the two preceding months' totals were revised up by a total of 25,000. The headline unemployment rate ticked up by a tenth, to 6.7%, but for a good reason -- a 0.2% increase in the labor force.\n\nAs has been discussed ad infinitum, much of the decline in the jobless rate has been because of dropouts from the labor force. Still, the labor-force participation rate remains at 63% of the working-age population, while the employment-to-population rate is at 58.8%, near where it was when the expansion began in June 2009, three months after the bull market's liftoff.\n\nAnother positive sign was a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings, but that's where the weather effect might be visible. As JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli writes, the average workweek slipped 0.1 hours, to 34.2 hours, almost certainly because of folks putting in fewer hours because of the weather. But if they got their full week's paycheck nonetheless, it would add up to higher average hourly earnings. While the trend in earnings is higher, Feroli calls last month's jump \"fluky.\"\n\nThe consensus view is that the Fed's tapering is a vindication of the economy's ability to stand on its own two feet. Ricchiuto, however, says that auto makers' cheap-financing spurs resulted in General Motors (GM) and Fiat, Chrysler's parent, overproducing and now having to offer incentives to trim inventories. In the housing market, the withdrawal of nontraditional buyers will slow the rise in home prices, \"and the cracks in the housing recovery will begin to widen,\" he says, with real growth slowing from the economy's current 2.25% trend rate.\n\nFor that reason, and with official inflation readings well within the Fed's 2% target, there's little reason to expect the monetary authorities to depart from their current glide path for securities purchases. And as New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday, he favors continued stimulus for \"a considerable time,\" with the first increase in the central bank's key interest- rate targets coming \"around the middle of 2015\" as \"a reasonable set of expectations.\"\n\nDoes that mean the bull will see a sixth birthday? Dudley pointed the previous day to a few areas of excess, according to colleague Brendan Conway on Barrons.com -- biotechnology stocks, leveraged loans, and farmland. The first asset class, coincidentally or not, came under considerable pressure late in the week. While it might have been a throwaway line, Dudley, the former chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs (GS), can't be unaware of the market impact of utterances of Fed officials.\n\nIn any case, biotechs have been among the market's leaders. And as Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners relates, one of the deans of market analysis (now retired) thinks the stumble in the formerly highflying group is a significant tell for the overall market -- even as it celebrates the fifth anniversary of the rally that has put stock prices at a peak.\n\nNEXT WEEK WILL MARK another, rather less joyous anniversary -- the collapse of Bear Stearns, which happened six years ago and is viewed in hindsight as the beginning of the slide into the credit crisis that erupted full blown the following fall. At the time, however, it was thought absorption of Bear into JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was a one-off thing and that everything was well under control.\n\nThat precedent was being invoked last week with the first default on a publicly traded corporate bond in China, of Chaori Solar, which, as its name suggests, flew Icarus-like and crashed. Most commentary suggested it was a good thing to allow the solar-panel maker to fail (see Tech Trader for more questions about solar) rather than for Chinese authorities to risk the moral hazard resulting from bailing out feckless borrowers.\n\nBut Citigroup's global macrostrategy team led by Jeremy Hale says not so fast, warning that \"this default may be the tip of the iceberg.\" While the missed interest payment is trivial at about $15 million, \"the symbolic significance is much bigger.\"\n\nChinese officials face a dilemma, the team writes. \"Setting a precedent that investors will always get bailed out is not long-term sustainable policy. Equally, there is no particularly good way to engineer the deflation of a credit bubble.\"\n\nAt the time of the Bear Stearns bust, the cost of insuring U.S. government debt in the credit-default swaps market initially rose in expectation of more bailouts, but then subsided as markets breathed a sigh of relief. But credit-default swap spreads on U.S. debt ultimately widened sharply later in the year, when the crisis was raging.\n\nThe Citi team says the default of the Chinese solar company won't necessarily result in a rerun of 2008. But they conclude there may be more corporate credit events ahead than investors expect now.\n\nE-mail: randall.forsyth@barrons.com", "76": "Blue chips, like American Express and General Electric, were trading in the single digits. Since then, the S&P 500 has rebounded 177 percent to new highs, and the wounded financial sector is up more than 250 percent but still 60 percent off its 2007 high, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\n\n\nFewer than a third of bull markets make it through a sixth year, but those that do have averaged gains of 26 percent in that year, says S&P Capital IQ. Monday marks the start of year six, and Wall Street strategists\u2014nearly all expecting solid gains this year\u2014say the economy will now have to prove that it is strong enough to keep corporate profits rising, as the Fed continues to pull back from its easy money policies.\n\n\n\n\"I think in a sense we're back to a more normal market environment,\" said Sam Stovall, chief strategist of S&P Capital IQ. Stovall, like others, says the market is particularly stretched since it has not had a major correction in months. \"I think we're bumping up against fair value for stocks, so unless we make some dramatic change to our economic and earnings growth expectations then I think we either have to correct in time or in price.\" But he still targets the S&P reaching 1,940 by year-end.\n\n\n\n(Read more: All clear on jobs front? Hmmm, maybe not so much)\n\n\n\nWhile many analysts drew parallels during the financial crisis to the Great Depression and the market crash that preceded it, Stovall said the policy reactions were very different this time. \"What was different was the way the Fed responded to the financial crisis. What made me think this is not the 1930s/1940s is we got back to break even after five years. It took 25 years to get back to break even after the crash of 1929, and I think the bulk of that delay was the missteps of both the Fed and the Treasury.\"\n\n\n\nWith the Fed stepping back from its bond-buying program, stocks will have to navigate an environment of rising rates as long as economic growth improves as expected. Rates moved higher after Friday's jobs report reinforced the view that a recent batch of weak data is likely temporary and the result of bad winter weather. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.81 percent, a six-week high. There were 175,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February, the best pace since last year.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Stronger jobs could signal higher rates)\n\n\n\n\"We are paying most attention to the growth numbers. Typically over the last several years, the monetary policy picture has been a huge driver, and getting that right was a big part of being correct about making money in the market,\" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. \"We think that's fading to the back burner. The market's got QE fatigue. What the market really needs to see to continue the bull market is organic growth because the Fed said: 'we want to get out of this game.' \"\n\n\n\nThe market will also have to deal with more volatility, already impacting stocks this year since the Fed began pulling back from its quantitative easing program. Analysts, however, do not expect rates to rise so rapidly stocks will be jarred, and that's partly because the Fed has vowed to hold short-term rates lower for longer.\n\n\n\n(Watch: Cashin says: Goldilocks jobs number)\n\n\n\n\"Our base case is we will see better performance of the market in the second half of the year because we do think better growth will come through. The stock market can handle higher rates as long as the economy is growing but if rates are rising because inflation is the cause, the market doesn't like that,\" McDonald said. \"The increases we have had in rates are because of better growth and a view the Fed is beginning to normalize policy, and we think that's good for the stock market.\"\n\n\n\nGary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said the market should be able to handle the Fed's move away from QE. He expects the S&P to reach 1,975 to 2,025 this year. \"I think the economy has been healing, and I think there's a lot of room for growth, and if you look at things like consumer debt ratios, debt service to income is very low\u2014the lowest level in 30 years. The last two times we were this low were the early stages of expansion in the early 1980s and early 1990s,\" he said. Thayer said the debt service to disposable income is down to 9.92 percent from 13.18 before the financial crisis and compared to 10.37 in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Americans borrow more but hit the plastic less)\n\n\n\n\"The bottom line is we still have the capacity to grow further if there aren't any major disruptions in the global economy. We think even though the market has done well in five years, there's a lot of room for further gains. It may not be smooth sailing every year, but we see more gains.\"\n\n\n\nThayer said he sees that the biggest risks for U.S. stocks are likely to come from overseas, and he would put money first into U.S. stocks, then Japan and Europe, and lastly emerging markets.\n\n\n\nMcDonald said the situation with Ukraine should not impact stocks even if Crimea becomes part of Russia, but further aggression could change that view.\n\n\n\n\"What would cause the bull market to end? There's two possibilities. One is the economy runs out of gas and investors say: 'There's no more monetary support. We're going to take money off the table,' \" he said. \"The second is the economy gets so strong that the Fed has to raise interest rates and you have a typical end of the bull market.\" But McDonald said he is still constructive on stocks though he said the idea that the economy gets weaker is the scenario he sees as more likely at some point in the next couple of years.\n\n\n\n\"We have gone over 600 days without a 10 percent correction. Typically on average, you have a 10 percent correction every 161 days. 1,250 days without a 20 percent correction. We typically have one every 635 days. The market is extended,\" said McDonald. \"Those periods tend to be more extended during bull cycles. It is not unusual to have longer cycles when the market is going up, and that 's what we experienced, but it's telling you this rally is long in the tooth.\"", "77": "The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.\n\nSubprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes, including the top two spots.\n\nAfter the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 \u2013 a little under 18 months later.\n\nU.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.\n\nSince that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).\n\nNote: Turn market volatility into profits by learning to trade the market's most powerful index.

This is like climbing a mountain into thin air \u2013 every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around.\"\n\nHere are the three signs that have investors worried we're due for a stock market crash or correction soon\u2026", "78": "SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) \u2014 U.S. stocks enter their sixth year of a bull market this Monday, joining a rare group of multi-year stock surges that can support early retirements, pay off college debt, and make pension funds whole.\n\nOr not. The fifth year of the last bull market ended spectacularly and painfully for investors in October 2007, leaving many so scarred they avoided stocks years into this latest rebound.\n\nThe good news: The few cycles that make it past their fifth birthday keep motoring along, churning out as much as a decade of gains. Momentum is your friend: On average, the sixth year has produced 26% growth.\n\nThe bad: There's plenty that\u2019s different this time around, starting with the Federal Reserve\u2019s full-throttle bond buys to flatten yields. The S&P 500 already produced an eye-popping 30% gain last year. The economy needs to get back its mojo \u2014 the 3% growth rate that\u2019s been elusive since 2005.\n\n\u201cWhat ended nearly every [bull market] was a recession, so we need continued economic growth,\u201d said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nThe almost five-year-old bull market started on March 10, 2009, when the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.33% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.24% both rebounded 6% in one day off their respective multi-year lows reached March 9. At the low, the S&P 500 closed at a bottom of 676.53, a drop of nearly 57% from its October 2007 highs. The Dow closed at 6,547.05. Since then, the S&P 500 has climbed 177% and the Dow has gained 151%.\n\nGroup of three\n\nConcern that days are numbered for the current bull market are not unfounded. A minority of bull markets since 1945 have made it to their sixth birthday.\n\nP/E ratios are back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007.\n\nIncluding the current bull market, there have been 12 since the end of World War II. Of those, only half of them made it to a fifth birthday, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, in a recent note.\n\nAfter that, the list gets halved again for those making it to a sixth birthday. Those bull markets include the 7-year bull market that ended in August 1956, the 6-year bull market that ended in November 1980, and the nearly 10-year-old bull market that ended in March 2000. Those go-go days of the 1990s bull market, which ended in the Internet bust, fattened nest eggs with an S&P 500 gain of over 400%.\n\nThe history is tantalizing, particularly for investors still repairing the damage from the last bear market and a concurrent housing market collapse.\n\nHere\u2019s what this bull market needs to do to make it to its sixth birthday, says Stovall:\n\nU.S. economic growth needs to ramp up and reach 3% by the end of 2014 supported by gains in auto sales and housing.\n\nEarnings per share growth needs to increase in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014 coupled with gains in revenue. Stovall expects an 8% advance in EPS with revenue rising 3.7%.\n\nCongress needs to indicate that it is working toward meaningful tax reform legislation by 2015 to help spur increased capital expenditures and repatriation of foreign earnings.\n\nValuations based on price-to-earnings ratios remain supportive.\n\nThat last part can be troubling given concerns that stock prices have grown faster than their supporting earnings. Stovall said that while the trailing 12-month P/E is above average since 1947, it\u2019s actually below the average when the consumer price index has been in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.\n\nFor the economy, a 3% growth rate for the U.S. isn\u2019t a slam dunk. The U.S. economy hasn\u2019t grown 3% or more in nine years. A recent revision of fourth-quarter GDP figures showed the economy growing at 2.4%, down from a previous figure of 3.2%.\n\nRead: Is the White House\u2019s 3.1% growth forecast still too rosy?\n\nIn this aging bull\u2019s favor, it\u2019s still cheap to borrow to buy and build. The yield on the 10-year Treasury US:10_YEAR note is in the 2.7% range \u2014 in contrast to 4.65% at the end of the last bull market in October 2007.\n\nStocks are \u2018shackled to earnings growth\u2019\n\nBack in March 2009, P/E ratios for stocks in the S&P 500 had fallen below 11x. Now, they\u2019re back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007. That means that earnings growth has become even more crucial to cool off those multiples.\n\nBull markets tend to tap out when trailing 12-month P/E ratios get into 17x to 18x territory, Kleintop said. Earnings can support valuations for now but are not enough to support another big market surge, Kleintop said.\n\n\u201cWe know what expensive looks like, so we\u2019re pretty shackled to earnings growth,\u201d Kleintop said.\n\nThat view is pretty consistent with what many strategists were calling for in December: After a big jump in 2013, stocks will likely grow in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014.\n\nAnother indication the current bull market will see a sixth birthday is that market breadth is relatively stable, meaning no one sector or handful of stocks is fueling the market.\n\nThe biggest drivers of the current bull market have been consumer discretionary stocks, followed up by financials, industrials, and tech stocks.\n\nLPL Financial Jeff Kleintop\n\nThat\u2019s opposed to the bull market that ended in 2000, where tech stocks were far and away the sole market driver, according to Kleintop. In the current bull market, growth is being driven by cyclical stocks, which are closely linked to the economy. While they may be expensive, consumer discretionary stocks have been more productive than they have ever been, and are therefore deserving of a higher multiple, Kleintop said.\n\nPriceline, Netflix among big bull winners with 1000% gains\n\nNotable consumer discretionary stocks that have jumped in price by more than 1000% over the past five years include Wyndham Worldwide Corp. US:WYN CBS Corp. CBS, -0.41% Priceline.com Inc. US:PCLN Wynn Resorts Ltd. WYNN, -6.60% Expedia Inc. EXPE, -2.00% Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -0.53% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -6.27% according to FactSet.\n\nIn 2013, financial and consumer discretionary earnings led the pack with gains of 16.3% and 11.3%, respectively, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. That\u2019s compared with the 4.9% increase in the S&P 500 for the year. In addition, consumer discretionary stocks also saw an above-average gain in revenue at 4.8% in 2013.\n\nOutside of GDP growth in the 3% area, the key to economic growth in 2014 will have to come from capital expenditure spending and hiring from corporations, which are sitting on record cash piles. That\u2019s crucial because capital investment accounted for no GDP growth in 2013, according to Kleintop.\n\nTech benefits\n\nCapital expenditure spending may improve in 2014, according to a recent note by Russ Koesterich, BlackRock global chief investment strategist.\n\nGiven the lackluster recovery, Koesterich said companies are still conservative given the overindulgences and excess capacity of the past two bull markets. Also, consumer confidence is just beginning to recover with current levels still under the long-term average. As the consumer strength returns to speed, certain industries are likely to benefit.\n\n\u201cIn terms of specific beneficiaries, we believe spending is likely to be led by financial, telecom and service industries,\u201d Koesterich noted. \u201cThis suggests that technology companies may be beneficiaries if capital spending begins to accelerate.\u201d\n\nMore on the bull market\u2019s 5th anniversary:\n\n5 ways to protect your profits as the bull market turns five\n\nWhy you\u2019ll be stuck with single-digit stock returns for years\n\n5 years after crisis, Citi is alone in trading below book value\n\nProviding critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.\n\nSome of Bitcoin enthusiast Mike Caldwell's coins are pictured at his office in this file photo illustration in Sandy, Utah January 31, 2014. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart/Files REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\n\nJudge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers\u2019 bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. Mt. Gox\u2019s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n\u201cThis case involves a massive fraud,\u201d said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. \u201cThey claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,\u201d said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt. Gox\u2019s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.\n\nHale\u2019s order protects Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.\n\nMt Gox\u2019s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies\u2019 owners.\n\nThe agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company\u2019s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies\u2019 activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.\n\nSuch is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means \u201cworthless little symbol\u201d in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.\n\nIt was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.\n\nAllard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.\n\nWhen reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.\n\nHe was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.\n\nRepresentatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.\n\nA man walks past a building where Mt. Gox, a digital marketplace operator, is housed in Tokyo February 25, 2014. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.\n\nThe bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver\u2019s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.\n\nThe case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.", "80": "Mt. Gox is well-known for creating one of the world's first Bitcoin trading posts. Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.\n\nMt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.\n\nThe Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.\n\nRelated: What Companies Accept Bitcoin?\n\nCEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. \"For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it.\"\n\nKarpeles continued, \"Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.\n\n\"The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet.

The class-action lawsuit was filed against Mt.

Gox\u2019s application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\u2019s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins.

The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.\n\n\"Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country,\" according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.\n\nAnother report has the Mt.

Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.\n\nBitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.\n\nThat is a lot of money, real or digital.\n\nThen, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has denied he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.\n\nSince then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.\n\nThe urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.\n\nA famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went bankrupt or dying.\n\nThe most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.\n\n\"Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date have failed, in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal,\" wrote Ken Griffith.\n\nThe other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.\n\nAt Hackingdistributed.com Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.\n\n\"Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect, and it isn't, our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions.

They do not keep track of who the company\u2019s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies\u2019 activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.\n\nSuch is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means \u201cworthless little symbol\u201d in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.\n\nIt was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.\n\nAllard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.\n\nWhen reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt.

Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.\n\nThe bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver\u2019s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.\n\nThe case is Mt.

Its management said the amount was stolen after hackers exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, but some of Mt. Gox's users are not so sure, suggesting instead that the exchange's owners pocketed the cash. Now, facing silence from those owners about the fate of the money and the methods by which 6 percent of all of the Bitcoin in the world could have been stolen, a group of hackers claims it has broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's network to get answers.\n\nForbes reports that the group gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The hackers used the platforms to post a message that claimed Karpeles still had access to some of the bitcoins that he'd reported stolen. In support of the claim, they uploaded a series of files that included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, Karpeles' home addresses, and a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data.\n\nThe hackers claim that Mt.

A note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads \"That fat fuck has been lying!!\"\n\nThe files could simply show poor accounting practices\n\nForbes says the veracity of the file has yet to be confirmed. It could simply highlight the kind of poor accounting practices that allowed hackers to steal the money in the first place, showing money in Mt. Gox's balances that has long since made its way to hacker hands; or it could be evidence to support the theory that the company used the cover of a transaction exploit to steal its customers' money. The exchange claimed it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins in its bankruptcy protection filing \u2014 in addition to 100,000 of its own bitcoins \u2014 but users of the cryptocurrency are yet to see that money appear on the log of public Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. That would suggest whoever does have the money isn't spending it at the moment.\n\nForbes suggests the hack may be related to another supposed breach in which a user on BitcoinTalk's forums offered a 20GB file that they said was also stolen from Mt.

Gox has been less than honest about money lost in a major security lapse. Yesterday, they hacked into CEO Mark Karpeles' blog and Reddit account, announcing that the company had kept currency it claimed was stolen, Forbes reports. They said they'd hacked Mt. Gox's servers, and posted a file full of data suggesting the exchange had a balance of 951,116 bitcoins. Hackers say that points to fraud after the company claimed it lost 750,000 of users' bitcoins.\n\nThe authenticity of the document isn't entirely clear, though some Reddit posters noted that personal account information revealed in the file appeared accurate, CNET notes. Still, it's possible that the balance shows money that was already lost in the security breach, reflecting bad accounting rather than theft, the Verge reports. Meanwhile, a bitcoin forum user said he or she was trying to sell 20 gigabytes of stolen information from Mt. Gox\u2014a database that holds user details, including passport scans. \"Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses (sic) from gox closure,\" the user said. The price: 100 bitcoins, or some $63,000, Forbes notes. (Read more hackers stories.)\n\n", "97": "Mt. Gox files for US bankruptcy amid new hacker claims\n\nHacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO\u2019s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors\u2019 virtual cash was lost. The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt.\n\nThe Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That\u2019s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.\n\nWhether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage.\n\nAlso unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers \u2013 as well as other details \u2013 were posted to Mt.

This comes two weeks after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time that MtGox got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,\u201d the hackers wrote.\n\nHowever, even if the leaked docs are genuine, it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing. It is still unclear what exactly happened to MtGox that caused it to file for bankruptcy protection. It may be that its systems still show a huge balance even though the Bitcoins have all disappeared, because any theft may not been properly recorded.\n\nMtGox also released a statement (PDF) warning former users of a number of phishing attacks that may be directed at them.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorian Nakamoto, the man Newsweek controversially accused of being the inventor of Bitcoin, has kept a dignified silence whilst the world frantically debates whether or not he was wrongly identified as the creator of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSomeone claiming to be Dorian's brother Arthur Nakamoto \u2013 who was supposedly quoted in the Newsweek article \u2013 took to Reddit and issued various bizarre statements about the alleged Bitcoin brainbox.\n\n\"Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exist today,\" the other supposed Nakamoto wrote. \"I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.\"\n\nHe added: \"I understand that I will be mis-quoted and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. What I wanted to do is to plead to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke.

Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.\n\nThe once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday. This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.\n\nOn 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.\n\nAs Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for Japanese bankruptcy protection (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.\n\nMt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss -- taking place over several years -- was due to \"weaknesses in the system\" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.\n\nOver the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt. Gox management.", "100": "Now anonymous hackers believe they have the answer \u2013 they're still in Mt Gox. \"On Sunday,\" reports Forbes, \"hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users.\"\n\nThe blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin. \"It\u2019s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.\"\n\nThe message provides a link to a zip file. \"Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.\"\n\nThe hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent \u2013 and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, \"I couldn\u2019t verify that Sunday\u2019s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox\u2019s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins\u2013that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.\"\n\nNevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk, Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. \"However,\" writes Bradbury, \"no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).\"\n\nSince then, he continues, \"these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.\"\n\nWhy this is happening is not so clear. \"One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions,\" suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace.\n\nIt is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. \"Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox,\" writes Bradbury. \"This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.\"\n\nOne thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers.", "101": "next Image 1 of 3\n\nprev next Image 2 of 3\n\nprev Image 3 of 3\n\nAnonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that Mt.

Gox.\n\nIn a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.\n\nAt that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.\n\nThe 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million.\n\nLevine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate.

The shuttering came hot on the heels of the collapse of MtGox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan at the end of last month after someone hacked into its system and stole some 850,000 bitcoins, representing around 7 percent of the estimated global total of the digital currency.\n\n\n\nFor the beleaguered bitcoin market, these thefts are just the tip of the iceberg. Unless bitcoin can recover its credibility, these recent setbacks could mark its demise.\n\n\n\nFor a decentralized currency like bitcoin, confidence means everything. When hacker attacks caused several bitcoin exchanges, including MtGox, to suspend withdrawals of the currency in February, its value plummeted down below $600, compared to a peak of $1,124 in late November.\n\n\n\nSince its introduction in 2009, bitcoin has become increasingly popular thanks to its ease of global transaction, difficulty in counterfeiting, high standardization, decentralization and inflation immunity due to a hard limit of 21 million. Compared to real-world currencies, perhaps the most unique feature of bitcoins is its decentralization, which means that the value of the digital currency is set independently of any bank or government.\n\n\n\nHowever, the decentralized nature of bitcoin is also a fatal flaw for the crypto-currency as there's nothing real to support its credibility; unlike gold for example, which is a physical commodity that has intrinsic value. As bitcoins do not have a financially sound issuer or any institutional valuation basis, its price could be very volatile and easily affected by outside factors. Looking back, losses of bitcoins to hackers have happened several times in the past, shaking investor confidence and causing sharp plunges in its prices. So for a currency which relies on user trust, if its credibility foundation is compromised, then its value would suffer enormously.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, hacker attacks are just one of the risks facing bitcoins. Since the online virtual currency has aroused concerns over financial stability, money laundering and other illegal activities, many governments are considering restrictions against bitcoins.\n\n\n\nUnlike a traceable credit card or online banking transfer, bitcoin transactions are relatively similar to cash transactions in that they are both nearly impossible to trace. The Silk Road, an eBay-like bitcoin exchange that included listings for guns and heroin, was recently shut down by the US authorities, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Canada was said to be tightening rules to keep closer track of virtual currencies to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Also, in December 2013, the largest bitcoin exchange in China was required to stop accepting deposits in renminbi, a move which drove prices down considerably. Given investor complaints pertaining to the collapse of MtGox, more regulatory scrutiny and restrictions could be expected in the coming years.\n\n\n\nWhile hacker attacks and tightened regulations may hurt its value, bitcoin copycats are meanwhile undermining its status as a unique virtual currency. Even though only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created, the crypto-currency market can expand limitlessly as new alternatives to bitcoins can always be created without laws or regulations to stop copycats.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of bitcoin's success last year, a variety of competing crypto-currencies were quickly introduced. In fact, there were already more than 140 copycats by the end of 2013.\n\n\n\nIn this sense, it could be just a matter of time before bitcoins lose their uniqueness. Take litecoin, currently the most popular bitcoin alternative, as an example. By the end of last year, the total circulation value of litecoin had exceeded $1 billion.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, bitcoin is an obvious breakthrough in terms of financial market innovation. Maybe its most fundemental problem now is that it's too surreal and forward-looking, at least from the point of view of existing political and economic establishments. While bitcoin hints at future evolutions in the world financial market, it may be too early yet for the world to completely embrace it.\n\n\n\nThe author is a CCTV financial commentator. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn\n\n\n\nChina Business News", "104": "Bitcoin exchange Mt.

They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.\n\nThe material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.\n\n\"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,\" wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word \"Goxed\" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.\n\nIt was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg.\n\nHe pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.", "107": "Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.\n\nThey said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox's claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.\n\nNeither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.\n\nKarpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.\n\nOne of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.\n\nKarpeles' blog was titled \"Magical Tux in Japan -- Geekness brought me to Japan!\" Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname \"MagicalTux\" when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline Sunday shortly after it was attacked.\n\nKarpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.\n\nThe attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.\n\nThe data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles' CV and a Windows executable called \"TibanneBackOffice,\" among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.\n\nThe release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nMt. Gox's demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin's public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.\n\nMt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.\n\nThe long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin's core software who've said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.\n\nMeanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.\n\nThe blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user's public bitcoin \"address\" or \"wallet,\" which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.\n\nAdam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox's bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.\n\nIn a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.\n\nAt that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.\n\nLevine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it's very, very difficult, and it's tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it's just obvious,\" he said.\n\nThe 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated US$474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.\n\nAn academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.\n\n\"For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,\" they wrote.\n\nBecause bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.\n\n\"A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,\" said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. \"This is serious money for serious people.\"\n\nAnother possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.\n\nIf that's the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.\n\nSend news tips and comments to jeremy_kirk@idg.com.

Gox and the theft of Bitcoins worth millions, anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that customer Bitcoin is not missing -- but instead is held at the heart of attempted fraud.\n\nLast month, the abrupt closure and week-long silence of Mt. Gox and its team frustrated, confused and angered investors. Once the dominant trading post for the cryptocurrency, Mt. Gox closed its doors after saying that cybercriminals managed to steal approximately 850,000 BTC, worth over $500 million, in cyberattacks taking place over several years.\n\nCompany CEO Mark Karpeles said Bitcoins were lost \"due to weaknesses in the system,\" and while Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in Japan, thousands of users have been left out of pocket -- as well as in the dark over their investments' future.\n\nNow embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, Karpeles and Mt. Gox staff have gone quiet, but this hasn't stopped other parties from trying to get to the bottom of the issue. Over the weekend, anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to the trading post and accessed to Mt. Gox data. After taking over Karpeles' blog and Reddit account over the weekend, on Pastebin, the group who broke in to the system said:\n\n\"It\u2019s time that Mt.

Gox's Bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to such information through database cracking.\n\nWithin the Pastebin summary, the hackers claim that the trading posts' current balance is 951,116 BTC, which if true, means that customer Bitcoin has not been lost -- and therefore fraud has been committed.\n\nIt is worth noting that this leak could show nothing more than poor accountancy practices -- one aspect of the company which has been reported as a crucial factor which led to the original cyberattacks going unnoticed for so long -- and the database may only show Bitcoins that were believed to be safe but were already gone. However, since Mt. Gox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions -- the Bitcoin blockchain -- has not registered the movement of \"stolen\" coins.\n\nIn related news, whether or not Mt. Gox personnel have sought to capitalize on their customers, cybercriminals have jumped upon the demise of the Bitcoin trading post in their own way to profit.\n\nAccording to a press release (.PDF) issued by Mt. Gox, phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Within the spam emails, hackers have used Mt. Gox's identity and asked for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost Bitcoin.", "110": "The debacle surrounding Mt. Gox continues to rumble on as CEO Mark Karpeles remains silent following his application for bankruptcy at the end of last month.\n\nOver the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nAccording to stats from CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.\n\nBitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.\n\nThe big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.\n\nHackers claim Mt.

The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.\n\nHowever, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.\n\nDogecoin on BitPay before Litecoin\n\nAccording to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform \u2013 even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.\n\nReddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:\n\n\"Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency\"\n\nThis is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: \"Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow.\"\n\nBitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.", "111": "Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.\n\nThe Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.\n\nWhile MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.\n\nUnder DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.\n\nThe attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.\n\nMtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.\n\nAfter trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.\n\nIts relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.\n\nUS Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it.

The result is that the collapse of and theft at Mt.Gox , the hacking of Flexcoin , and the breach at Poloniex have all served to damage Bitcoin\u2019s young reputation. This for no good reason \u2013 Bitcoin is not in any way to fault for the recent problems. But you wouldn\u2019t know it by listening to some popular voices; most are all too happy (and quick) to dump on Bitcoin. For example, Bill Maher.During the New Rules segment of the most recent Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher said:Actually, Bill, they were playing Magic: The Gathering \u2026 Okay? Alright, that\u2019s neither here nor there\u2026On the ultra-libertarian website \u201cThe Prudent Bear\u201d, writer Martin Hutchinson gleefully wrote , \u201cBad luck Millennials. Your new and clever scheme to replicate the old-fashioned virtues of gold in the cybersphere appears to have fallen apart.\u201dWrong, both of you! Wrong, wrong, wrong!This is part of a larger narrative, one that hides in the statistics of Bitcoin and other digital currencies; the people who use them are really young ! Hell, more than 90% of Bitcoiners are male and between 20-30 years old. As a result, this means that just about every person in mainstream media and economics \u2013 who have an average age of, what, roughly 3000 \u2013 have no bloody clue about Bitcoin.In the end we\u2019re left with half-baked thoughts on the subject, like Maher\u2019s\u2026 I mean, to Bill Maher: you trusted Lehman Brothers not too long ago\u2026 How did that work out for you? Was Mr. Fuld more trustworthy than three kids in a basement, or less?And given that Bill\u2019s real money really disappeared with no real charges against real people, I wonder if he \u2013 like those who lost their Bitcoin on Mt. Gox \u2013 feels like a real idiot?I'm off-track again...To move in the right direction, it\u2019s important to first understand that Bitcoin is not to blame for the recent screw-ups at Mt. Gox, Poloniex, and Flexcoin; and in order to do that it only makes sense to understand why and how Bitcoin works.So let\u2019s have at it \u2013 why and how does Bitcoin work? And what makes it so special?The most direct answers come from the initial information paper on Bitcoin which was authored by the currency\u2019s enigmatic inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d, the paper asserts a desire to eliminate large financial institutions from internet commerce.In essence, Nakamoto views the use of third party institutions as an unnecessary expense in the age of online business. To this point Nakamoto writes, \u201cThe cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions.\u201dBitcoin, then, was to serve as \u201can electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201dAnd hell, the system has worked amazingly well in this capacity. While it\u2019s easy to point to the Colossus-level disaster at Mt. Gox, Bitcoin\u2019s impact on global remittance (i.e. when someone who is working abroad sends money home) has been astonishing. Did you know that global remittance totalled between $400-520 billion USD in 2012, that most major financial institutions charge between 9-20% for money transfers, or that most Bitcoin transfer services charge 3%, or a flat rate (typically $3 USD or so) for the same service?But this still doesn\u2019t fully explain how Bitcoin works. Sure, we\u2019ve scratched the surface of why it\u2019s useful, but how does it work?Articles abound, I would suggest starting with the most basic primer, available on Bitcoin.org , or if you\u2019re willing to read a somewhat long, slightly biased explanation of Bitcoin, check out the article on HowStuffWorks.com . What every article is essentially explaining though is that the Peer-to-Peer structure of Bitcoin (and, in theory, digital currencies using similar code,) solves what is called the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem (also called the Two Generals\u2019 Problem or Byzantine fault tolerance).By allowing computers all over the world to assist in providing hashes (essentially transactions stamps) which are then sent to what is called the block-chain (a massive public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions), the decentralized system works to ensure that each transaction between a Bitcoin holder and Bitcoin recipient is unique. As well, the nature of the relationship between the Peer-to-Peer network which is providing hashes to the block-chain is such that the ability for hackers to every disrupt the network grows more difficult as time passes.In short, Bitcoin \u2013 through the use of cryptographic stamps, provided by a decentralized peer-to-peer based network \u2013 successfully solves the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem thus creating an entirely decentralized and secure network for direct business-to-consumer interactions; in theory this serves to eliminate the need for financial institutions that act as third-party operators in online commerce.What Bitcoin doesn\u2019t do, though, is address the issues that arise when tens, hundreds, or thousands of digital currencies are on the market and people want to trade those digital currencies for other digital currencies, or for fiat currencies... And that makes a hell of a lot of sense. Bitcoin is Bitcoin; it is not every coin\u2026 To say it again, Bitcoin eliminates the need for trusted third-party institutions as far as a transaction that deal exclusively with Bitcoin.For example, if a person mines Dogecoin, then wants to trade it in for Bitcoin, then trade the Bitcoin for Mooncoin, then to Litecoin, then back to Bitcoin, they're going to need third-party operator to help out.Enter online exchanges.Unlike Bitcoin, online exchanges are not decentralized; just the opposite. Online exchanges have physical and permanent addresses, physical and accessible servers, employees who maintain the security of those servers, profits and expenditures. Unlike a Bitcoin wallet that is hosted on a laptop or USB stick \u2013 to which only the user has access ( decent security measures assumed ) \u2013 a wallet on an online exchange is, fundamentally, in the possession of the online exchange, and accessible to people with admin privileges or the technical capacity to breach them.So what has happened at these fast-falling exchanges? Well, no one really knows. The best explanations available explain what clearly did not happen. If anything, the conclusion that Bill Maher came to may be closest to correct: The people running these exchanges can be shadier than Slim The best read I\u2019ve found on the subject, \u201c What Did Not Happen at Mt. Gox \u201d by hacker and Cornell Professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, came to this fantastic conclusion; \u201cWhat Nigerian scams are to your grandfather, Bitcoin exchanges are to the 20-30 semi-tech-savvy libertarian demographic.\u201dIn other words, it\u2019s incredibly easy to be taken for a ride by the \u2018Nigerian princes\u2019 that run these exchanges. The theft at Flexcoin, wherein $600,000 US went missing, saw the funds transfer to just two Bitcoin wallets. At Poloniex, 12.3% of Bitcoins were stolen overnight. A few people are suggesting that the breach at Mt. Gox could have been an However, if legitimate online exchanges are able to codify a clear system by which they can assure security (or better yet, insure), this problem, like the Byzantine Generals before it, will fall.And it looks like eBay is about to tackle the issue.As reported on eCommerceBytes.com , eBay has filed an application that seems to hint they may be getting into the online exchange business. To quote from the patent application Wouldn't that be interesting to see? My bet is that if a mega-firm like eBay launches an online exchange and markets it well, a horde of new and eager digital currency users will quickly get involved. And that bodes very well for Bitcoin, along with the countless other digital currencies out there. More legitimacy, more publicity (of the positive sort), and more opportunities to use digital currencies will all serve to increase their value.Of course, it's worth noting safe exchanges already exist provided that you use them properly. A great first step in ensuring safety is to remember that online exchanges are not banks. It's silly and dangerous to think of them as anything other than places to make quick trades; a place where you can take your privately stored currency, trade it for another, and then return your new currency back to a private, backed-up, offline wallet.After what has been a rough few months for Bitcoin, it's great to see that there might be huge and positive advances with regard to online exchanges in the near future; eBay or otherwise, digital currencies need better, trustworthy exchanges in order for current and future users to better trust the currencies themselves.", "115": "Bitcoin was a dream come true for computer geeks, libertarians and big government paranoids.\n\nJust imagine a digital currency untethered from government regulators, existing only in the virtual world of computer code and cheaper to use than credit cards.\n\nBut the recent collapse of a leading bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, has raised concerns about the legitimacy of this virtual currency.\n\nA $470 million digital heist last month at the Tokyo-based exchange pushed the company into bankruptcy and left many bitcoin investors empty-handed with little recourse.\n\nMt.

It comes fast, and it ain\u2019t pretty.\n\nBut at least sovereign governments and regulatory authorities stand behind and monitor traditional currencies. While Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate is even more volatile than traditional currencies, there is no oversight from the FDIC, Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury.\n\nTyler Moore, an SMU assistant professor in computer science and engineering, said he doesn\u2019t believe the Mt. Gox fiasco will spell the demise of bitcoin, but regulatory safeguards are needed. Moore co-authored a research report last year in which he examined the risks of investing in bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin ecosystem is in need of regulatory oversight and reform,\u201d he wrote in an email response to my questions. \u201cBitcoin currency exchanges act like de facto banks. Many customers leave the bitcoins in accounts at the exchanges, but there are no capital requirements as there are for traditional banks.\u201d\n\nThis makes bitcoin exchanges vulnerable to withdrawal spikes, otherwise known as bank runs. Moore said the security breach at Mt. Gox wiped out the capital reserves of the exchange. He examined the track record of 40 bitcoin exchanges and found that 18 have closed \u201cwith customer account balances often wiped out.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was supposedly created about five years ago by a computer programming genius named Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 probably a pseudonym. Nakamoto created 31,000 lines of computer code that essentially created bitcoin, according to The New Yorker magazine.\n\nThrough this computer program, he set a limit on the amount of Bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system. Only 21 million bitcoins will be created over the next 20 years and currently about 12 million are in virtual circulation, meaning they are held in bitcoin \u201cwallets\u201d inside computers all over the world.\n\nWhen I last wrote about the bitcoin phenomenon last summer, the exchange rate was $100 for one bitcoin. As it gained popularity it topped $1,100 in December.\n\nBut with the bad publicity swirling around Mt. Gox, one bitcoin now fetches about $500. Some 850,000 bitcoins, or about 7 percent of the bitcoins in circulation, were stolen from Mt. Gox.\n\nMoore cited several examples of security breaches at bitcoin exchanges and other frauds. While it didn\u2019t involve an exchange, one of the largest bitcoin Ponzi schemes occurred here in North Texas\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint dated July 23, 2013, that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.\n\nThe SEC is seeking monetary penalties and the return of the ill-gotten gains.\n\nPerhaps the government can get back some of the lost money for investors if in fact this was a Ponzi scheme. But for the long-term stability of bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, Moore advocates some kind of mechanism \u201cto reimburse customers for fraudulent transactions.\u201d\n\nAn article in The Atlantic probably summed it up best: \u201cNo matter how perfect a technological concept is, when it enters the world of human beings, it becomes imperfect. Bitcoin is no exception.\u201d", "116": "Mt. Gox hackers post Bitcoin balances on CEO\u2019s own blog\n\nGiven how much Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has lost, both in terms of money and trust, it was only a matter of time before hackers struck back. Now such a group of enraged victims have hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles\u2019 own blog to reveal just how much the company really lost.\n\nMt. Gox\u2019s fall from grace is a matter of public knowledge, but the true extent of the damages incurred by the company is unsurprisingly kept behind closed doors. In fact, the entire company\u2019s strategy in dealing with its financial, and now legal, problems were supposed to be a secret until a \u201ccrisis strategy draft\u201d document was leaked.\n\nThe document details the steps the company needs to take in order to appear less culpable, starting from inexplicably disappearing from the Internet, stepping down from the Bitcoin Foundation board, issuing a vague statement explaining the disappearance, and filing for bankruptcy, all of which took place the past weeks. Also notable in that document was the admission that Mt. Gox lost as much as 744,408 bitcoins due to a bug, amounting to around $340 million at that time. It seems, however, that the real, undisclosed figures are far worse.\n\nHackers dived into Mt. Gox\u2019s database not to steal bitcoins, or so the hackers said, but to get their hands on databases that will reveal the truth. With a hint of poetic justice, these same hackers used Karpeles\u2019 blog to post database dumps and other files that they were able to acquire. Among those is a list of the actual Bitcoin balances, which revealed the real number to be 951,116 bitcoins. That amount is a far cry from that in the leaked document as well as the numbers given by Mt. Gox itself when it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nKarpeles\u2019s blog has been taken down now but, under the exhortation of the hackers, the data has been mirrored and made available elsewhere for others to see and review, including anonymized user accounts and their balances. Although the hackers claim that no user database dump has been made public, the incident demonstrates how Mt. Gox\u2019s security can be so easily compromised, which is how it ended up in trouble in the first place.\n\nVIA: TechCrunch", "117": "A Japanese newspaper is reporting that during the spectacular collapse of the Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange, the operation's servers were also suffering a large-scale DDOS attack.\n\nThe Yomiuri Shimbun's English-language Japan News reports that the attacks in early February reached 150,000 DDOS hits per second, \u201cmostly from servers in the United States and Europe\u201d.\n\nJapan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University: \u201cDDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques.\u201d\n\nReferring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin, Uehara said: \u201cIt is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox\u2019s system were found.\u201d\n\nBy February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOf the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.\n\nMt Gox is under investigation in the US and Japan. \u00ae\n\nSponsored: Five steps to dealing with the insider threat", "118": "Anonymous hackers have defaced Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles\u2019 blog and have uploaded a data dump of customer data that, according to users with accounts on the site, is accurate.

You deserve everything you get for what you did.\u201d", "119": "Mt Gox collapse shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual money By Peter Morici\n\nBitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when Mt. Gox, the world\u2019s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed. The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing. Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your wealth\u2014you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter\u2014a necessity for even the most rudimentary market economy. Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government declares those to be \u201clegal tender for all debts public and private.\u201d You can do business through barter or some alternative currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars, and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter. What gives money its value are the goods and services that may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the issuing government. The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more than two thousand years ago. The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and destroy its value through inflation. However, inflation is hardly a problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency\u2019s creator, and like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. There is no \u201cBitland\u201d where a government has declared it legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes. Lacking such a tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day, never mind next year. Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands only about half that amount. It is no place for your children\u2019s college fund or retirement savings. Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to thieves. A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. However, personal and business transactions can be spied by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your exchange when it needs. Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised. Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a currency accepted and secure\u2014the government guarantee and the good sense of the sovereign not to abuse its franchise. It\u2019s not the gold but the face of Caesar\u2014the promise his image carries\u2014that makes a coin money.

Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a security lapse, hackers hit the personal blog of Bitcoin exchange's chief executive to level charges of fraud.\n\nThe Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, MagicalTux.net, were hijacked Sunday and defaced with a post that alleged the exchange kept some of the coins allegedly stolen in fraudulent withdrawals. Hackers also posted a 716MB Zip file that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox servers on the sites as well as to Pastebin.\n\nThe data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.\n\n\"First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,\" hackers wrote. \"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed.\" The phrase \"getting Goxed\" has become synonymous with the frustration felt by many Mt. Gox investors, who have suffered frequent outages, delayed trading, and suspended withdrawals.\n\n\"Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,\" the hackers wrote their profanity-laced diatribe. \"No user database dumps have been included.\"\n\nCNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nCNET has contacted Mt. Gox for comment and will update this report when we learn more.\n\nAt its height, Mt. Gox was one of the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchanges. However, the troubled exchange suspended customer withdrawals on February 7, claiming a fundamental flaw existed in Bitcoin that affected all transactions. Mt. Gox later apologized for the issue and said it had developed a workaround that would allow it to resume service, but that has not yet happened.\n\nDue to the currency's encryption technology, it might be difficult, if not impossible, for the stolen bitcoins to be restored to their owners' accounts, leaving people across the globe with significant losses.", "121": "Following the MtGox Bitcoin exchange losing millions to a hack and filing for bankruptcy, anonymous attackers took over the personal blog and reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday.

Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.\"\n\nForbes reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances\u2014with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, \"That fat fuck has been lying!!\"\n\nDespite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.", "122": "Bitcoin enthusiasm weathers chaotic week\n\nhello\n\nA poster alerting customers that the digital currency Bitcoin is accepted as payment sits behind the counter inside a cafe in London. Bitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing. ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFuture generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager's moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.\n\nThe past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency's mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.\n\n\"Bitcoin works really well,\" said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. \"All this craziness around Bitcoin isn't around Bitcoin itself. It's around the people.\"\n\nBitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.\n\n\"It's completely Wild West,\" said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. \"There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing.\"\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.\n\nBut criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as \"hot wallets.\" Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.\n\nThe most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.\n\nMt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.\n\n\"The [Bitcoin] system and protocol itself was and is still sound,\" Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. \"The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry.\"\n\nFlexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick -- once popular against ATMs -- of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.\n\nHobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. \"Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood,\" he said. \"That's what happened.\"\n\nAmid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.\n\nThe currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.\n\nPresented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted -- after asking for lunch -- when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man's relatives.\n\nRising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency's stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.\n\nBitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a \"block chain,\" that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.\n\nThe block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins -- rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- without finally and definitively revealing his identity.", "123": "Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox was reportedly attacked 150,000 times per second by hackers in the days leading up to its collapse last month.\n\nThe Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.\n\nDuring DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.\n\nLawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (\u00a3344m).\n\nUnlike traditional currencies, which are backed by central banks, Bitcoin is created by complex interactions between a large network of computers across the globe.\n\nJanet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, said that it has no control over virtual currencies which are not backed by any central authorities. Several countries, such as Russia and China, have placed heavy restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.\n\nMtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world\u2019s largest marketplace for Bitcoins, handling an estimated 80pc of all transactions of the digital currency.\n\nLast week, more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.\n\nIt is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.\n\nRichard Howlett, co-founder of Selachii, said: \u201cOn the back of the MtGox collapse, a lot of people say they feel the truth is not being stated.\u201d\n\nMark Karpeles, chief executive of MtGox, apologised for the collapse at a news conference earlier this month, blaming a \u201cweakness in our system\u201d, but predicted that the market will grow.", "124": "The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users' bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox's staff isn't talking. So another group of hackers say they've broken into the company's servers to provide answers of their own.\n\nOn Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. \"It\u2019s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,\" wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be \"goxed\"--to suffer from Mt. Gox's technical glitches.\n\nThe hackers also posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles' personal website that they said comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. It appears to include an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a file that purports to show the company's balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers' access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles' home addresses and Karpeles' personal CV.\n\nUpdate: Users on Reddit are warning that the hackers\u2019 files may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins. Other Reddit users have confirmed that they found their own account history in the data, indicating that it\u2019s not fake. But for security reasons, I don\u2019t recommend anyone download the collection of hacked files.\n\nIn the hackers' summary of Mt. Gox's balances in various currencies, they point to a claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they take as evidence that Mark Karpeles' claim to have lost users' digital currency to hackers is fraudulent. \"That fat fuck has been lying!!\" a note in the file reads.\n\nI've reached out to Karpeles for comment, but haven't yet heard back from him. Mt. Gox's embattled chief executive has remained almost entirely mum as his company has imploded over the last weeks.\n\nIn a possibly related incident, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message--since deleted by the forum's moderators--claiming to be offering for sale a 20 gigabyte stolen database from Mt. Gox, including the personal details of all its users and even scans of their passports. \"This document will never be elsewhere published by us,\" wrote the user, who went by the name nanashi____. \"Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure.\" The hacker asked for a price of 100 bitcoins for the database, about $63,600 at current exchange rates. '\n\nI've reached out to nanashi____ via an email address he or she provided, and I'll update this post if I hear back.\n\nI couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the \"lying\" that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins--that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.\n\nBut as Bitcoin experts pore over the hacked files, they may yet offer clues to the mystery around Mt. Gox's fate. The Bitcoin community has been puzzled by the apparent lack of movement of Mt. Gox's bitcoins since the company declared bankruptcy last month. Despite stating that it lost 850,000 bitcoins in total in its bankruptcy filing, Bitcoin experts haven't seen the movement of those coins in the Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.\n\nModerators on the Bitcoin subforum on Reddit deleted the hackers' post a few hours after it first appeared, stating that posting stolen content violated the forum's etiquette rules. But users on the forum didn't hesitate to draw their own conclusions: the top post on the forum Sunday afternoon read \"Mt.

As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.\n\n\"Bitcoin works really well,\" said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. \"All this craziness around Bitcoin isn\u2019t around Bitcoin itself. It\u2019s around the people.\"\n\nBitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.\n\n\"It\u2019s completely Wild West,\" said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. \"There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing.\"\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.\n\nBut criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as \"hot wallets.\" Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.\n\nThe most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.\n\nMt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.\n\n\"The (Bitcoin) system and protocol itself was and is still sound,\" Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. \"The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry.\"\n\nFlexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick \u2014 once popular against ATMs \u2014 of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.\n\nHobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. \"Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what happened.\"\n\nAmid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.\n\nThe currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.\n\nPresented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted \u2014 after asking for lunch \u2014 when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man\u2019s relatives.\n\nRising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency\u2019s stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.\n\nBitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a \"block chain,\" that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.\n\nThe block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins \u2014 rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 without finally and definitively revealing his identity.", "126": "Those of you fortunate enough to live near London's Tech City can get your hands on some Bitcoin more easily than ever before, thanks to a newly-installed Bitcoin cash machine. It's in good company, joining Seattle and Austin, which were the first cities to host pop-up Bitcoin ATMs last month.\n\nThe cash machine can be found inside the Old Shoreditch Cafe and Bar, and lets people top-up their Bitcoin wallets easily by scanning the QR code from their Bitcoin wallet, where they can insert up to \u00a31,000 in cash, and bam! Instant Bitcoin. Sadly it doesn't work the other way around, as the cafe's owner, Joel Raziel, has decided against letting people use the machine to swap their Bitcoins for real cash.\n\nThe machine has apparently been a big success, with one nutter man coming all the way from Manchester for the chance to use the machine. Raziel hopes that the machine will catch on in other parts of the country, and it's probably not the worst thing that Shoreditch can offer the world, all things considered. But with Bitcoin's mysterious founder being outed, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsing, and the Winklevoss twins using it to pay Richard Branson for a galactic flight (virtually killing it with their uncoolness), we're not too confident this ATM will last past summer.

Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.Yellen has said US regulators, including the Treasury, are watching the Bitcoin sector for potential money laundering and other criminal uses of the digital currency.MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 percent of global Bitcoin transactions, last week sought bankruptcy protection and admitted that it lost half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency.Suga said Friday that Japanese officials were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.This week, an alleged theft of $600,000 worth of the currency by hackers forced a Canada-based online business serving Bitcoin traders and investors to shut down.In more misfortune linked with the troubled currency, Singapore police on Thursday said they were investigating the \"unnatural\"death of a 28-year-old American boss of a Bitcoin exchange.Autumn Radtke, chief executive of Singapore-based First Meta, was found dead on February 26, but no foul play was suspected, police said.Also on Thursday, Newsweek claimed it had found the true identity of the mysterious person or group behind the Bitcoin revolution -- \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", a 64-year-old, Japanese-American physicist and model train enthusiast.Nakamoto has denied being involved in Bitcoin.The Bitcoin Foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm Newsweek's story.After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $650 level.", "128": "A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.\n\nIn its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered - or more often, not covered - by existing law.\n\nThe issue took on new prominence in Japan on Feb. 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.\n\nBitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, \"we have not grasped the situation in its entirety.\"\n\nThe authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.\n\nFewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox's 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.\n\n\"It's not money,\" said Finance Minister Taro Aso. \"Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?\" he asked at a regular news conference. \"Opinions are divided.\"\n\nThe government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.\n\nBut, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.\n\nRegarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether with bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it notes.\n\nThe 6-page document is the government's official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.", "129": "Bitcoin has spurred interest in virtual currencies, which have the ability to revolutionize our world. But governments and regulators will have the last word on bitcoin\u2019s future prospects.\n\nAfter a year of wild price swings\u2013from $13.50 per coin in January 2013 to $1,242 in November and now back to around $500\u2013and the recent closure of Mt. Gox in Japan, until recently bitcoin\u2019s largest exchange, the bitcoin currency system looks far too volatile to become a universal currency any time soon. However, some economists and venture capitalists believe that a digital monetary system has enough practical advantages that sooner or later, your money may be even more virtual than it is now. What is the future of bitcoin?\n\nInvented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of an unknown cryptographer, bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer payment system that enables people to make transactions without any recourse to a government-issued currency.\n\nBut like the ones and zeros that make up the binary language of the digital world, the views of what that future might look like tend to run toward extremes. On the con side, science fiction writer and economic blogger Charles Stross imagines that a bitcoin economy would starve government services by reducing government\u2019s ability to tax, make it easier to trade all kinds of illegal things, and in the end, make \u201ca sub-Saharan kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia\u201d.\n\nBitcoin boosters, on the other hand, see it as a key technology in building a more prosperous world in which capital moves with less friction, individuals are completely free to make their own economic choices, and money is no longer a government monopoly. As one bitcoin site puts it, \u201cNo individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Pluses and Minuses\n\nIf the advantages and the disadvantages sound quite similar, that\u2019s no accident. Many of bitcoin\u2019s most committed supporters have a Libertarian bent, and argue that apart from a few limited functions, the world could be run better if people were left largely to their own devices.\n\nA world dominated by a digital, non-state currency, would be \u201ca world of strong privacy,\u201d says David D. Friedman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California and son of the late free market economist Milton Friedman.\n\nStrong privacy would share many of the characteristics of the old Swiss bank system that enabled people to hold assets anonymously\u2013a good thing say, if you\u2019re trying to escape from the Nazis, but not so good if you\u2019re a citizen in a developing country trying to find your country\u2019s vanished oil revenues.\n\nTaxation would be more difficult in a world of strong privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tax something you can\u2019t see,\u201d Friedman says. It would also be a lot more difficult to watch what people are doing.\n\nOne possible preview of the dark side of that future came in November, when the US Justice Department disclosed the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, a kind of underworld eBay, in San Francisco. Prosecutors allege that the secret website had made it possible for people to buy and sell drugs, arms, and a variety of illicit services, all with bitcoins.\n\nIt would also make it more difficult for governments to clamp down on organizations for ideological reasons. Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the technology policy program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says a virtual currency would also make it a lot harder for governments stop organizations they don\u2019t like. Wikileaks, for instance, was starved of funds because the US government made it impossible for people to donate money to the controversial group.\n\nBitcoin could lead to considerable disruption in the financial world as well. For example, bitcoin could be a boon for migrant workers, who now must spend a considerable part of their income simply sending their hard-earned money home. Migrant workers send more than $500 billion home a year, according to World Bank figures, and currently pay high fees on those remittances: a 2010 United Nations report noted that they pay as much as $18 on a $200 transfer by Western Union or the other two leading operators.\n\nHowever, as radical as some of these changes might sound, Dourado argues that people have overlooked even more revolutionary implications of bitcoin. \u201cI think bitcoin is actually a kind of base-layer protocol in the same way that TCP/IP is for the internet,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is programmable money,\u201d Dourado explains. As a ledger-based system, a bitcoin could be attached to some real property. For example, a single bitcoin might be tied to a title deed, making it possible to buy a car without ever meeting the seller. Or it might be programmed to perform an if-then statement, he says, making it possible to create Kickstarter-like but entirely decentralized markets.\n\nDourado\u2019s view isn\u2019t unique. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, has argued in the New York Times that bitcoin is at a similar stage of development to the personal computer in 1975 or the internet in 1993, and represents \u201ca sweeping vista of opportunity\u201d.\n\nAndreessen and number of other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are already trying to stake claims in that sweeping vista. In 2013, venture capitalists invested $74 million in 40 bitcoin-related ventures, $50 million of that in the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights, a venture capital data analytics firm.\n\nBigger players may be trying to get in on this virtual gold rush as well. In December, eBay filed a patent application for something that sounds a lot like electronic money and could be sent by one person to another, \u201ca Gift Token\u2026 that can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product.\u201d Tokens could also be limited geographically, according to the application, to a particular city or region.\n\nNot-so-Brave New World\n\nBut whether bitcoin itself is part of that digital monetary future remains to be seen. Enough legal problems have already cropped up that the new currency could end up being the Napster of digital money\u2013the pioneer that paves the way for a more government-friendly alternative. It has been especially difficult for bitcoin in China.\n\n\n\nGovernment officials in Europe and elsewhere won\u2019t sit back forever if the use of digital money grows, predicts Robert Pargac, Director of Global Investigations and Compliance for Navigant Consulting in New York. Should the value of bitcoins remain volatile, regulators could ultimately classify them as a type of commodity, he says.\n\n\u201cIf [bitcoin proponents] really want a secretive, anonymous, free-floating market-driven virtual currency that\u2019s not regulated, that\u2019s simply not going to happen,\u201d says Pargac. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be good for the consumer, it won\u2019t be good for the economy and regulators and law enforcement will not permit it. They will find it and they will close it down.\u201d", "130": "Japan has become perhaps the world\u2019s most important locale for bitcoin, the digital currency that was supposed to liberate its users from the tyranny of geography\u2014and its government is playing catch-up.\n\nThis week the creator of bitcoin has been allegedly unmasked as a Japanese-born Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who was \u201cdescended from samurai and the son of a buddhist priest,\u201d according to Newsweek. The media circus around Nakamoto, who has denied Newsweek\u2019s claims, comes as the bitcoin world is still reeling from the failure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which went from being the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange to an ignoble bankruptcy last week.\n\nIt was the failure of Mt. Gox that finally spurred prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government to issue its first major proclamation about bitcoin on March 7, and it\u2019s fair to say that Japan\u2019s stance is still a work in progress.\n\nChief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that bitcoin would be treated as a commodity, not as a currency, and \u201cas a matter of common sense\u201d it would be \u201cnatural\u201d for the government to tax bitcoin transactions. But the government also said it was still gathering information on bitcoin\u2014including an attempt to determine the total volume and value of bitcoins in circulation. The total number of Japanese bitcoin owners is also not clear.\n\n\u201cWe are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do,\u201d Suga added.\n\nJapan\u2019s financial institutions have also been grappling with how to deal with bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mizuho Bank, which handled wire transfers and other business from Mt. Gox, repeatedly asked the exchange to shut down its account (paywall) because of an \u201cunmanageable volume of money transfers,\u201d many of them between Mt. Gox and its international customers.\n\nThe Japanese government issued a statement earlier this week that it does not prohibit financial firms from investing funds in bitcoin, but they are banned from exchanging between bitcoins and conventional currencies.\n\nAt least a few Japanese bitcoin owners are still optimistic despite the events of the last few weeks. Keiichi Hida of the Japan Digital Money Association, who lost\u00a5100,000 ($980) when Mt. Gox failed, told Reuters, \u201cWe should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cI think then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant.\u201d", "131": "The virtual currency known as Bitcoin is likely here to stay. Not in its current form, not after its many problems were cast in stark relief by the collapse of Mt. Gox, formerly the world\u2019s largest bitcoin bank. It famously lost all $500 million-plus worth of the Bitcoins its clients had on deposit when hackers attacked its website. The spectacular blowout at the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox on Feb. 28, the site had been plagued for months by abrupt shutdowns and other technical woes, was preceded weeks earlier by the arrest of BitInstant founder Charles Shrem, whose Bitcoin bank is accused of facilitating drug transactions on Silk Road, a notorious and now-defunct Internet black market for illicit drug sales.\n\nVirtual currency is here to stay, says David Olive, whether it exists as a Bitcoin or in some other form. ( MINDY SCHAUER, / MCT )\n\nVIDEO The nuts and bolts of Bitcoin\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAnd the demise of Mt. Gox has been followed by a robbery, by hackers, of an estimated $600,000 (U.S.) worth of Bitcoins from the Alberta Bitcoin bank Flexcoin. It also came to light this week that Autumn Radtke, 28-year-old CEO of Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange First Meta, had died of \u201cunnatural\u201d causes on the day Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy. Bitcoin, which holds the promise of becoming the world\u2019s first global currency, is for now easily mocked. It is just four years old. It is almost wholly unregulated. It is backed neither by central banks nor national treasuries. And there is no Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. or its equivalent elsewhere to make good on, for instance, the half-billion-dollars worth of Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. By April of last year, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions had reached 70,000, remarkable for a currency that debuted in 2009. But the estimated total value of Bitcoin transactions was a mere $2 billion \u2014 not even a rounding error in a global economy of $72 trillion. The value of Bitcoins has been hugely volatile, even by the standards of the most volatile commodities. In the first four months of last year, the value of a Bitcoin gyrated wildly, from $13 to $266, before suddenly plunging more than 60 per cent. Yet by November of last year, the Bitcoin\u2019s value had recovered to set a record high of more than $1,200, before stumbling to its current value of $525 or so in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox debacle. Rank speculation is behind that volatility, giving the not-ready-for-prime-time currency a reputation in \u201cproper\u201d circles of \u201cTrading tulips in real time,\u201d the comparison with 18th-century Tulipmania to the Bitcoin phenomenon used by Art Cashin, a veteran broker at the giant Swiss-based traditional bank UBS AG.\n\nAnd yet, and yet. Few merchants price their goods in Bitcoins \u2014 how could they, given their volatility? \u2014 but a surprisingly large number of online merchants now accept Bitcoins as payment. Such merchants are protected by firms like Utah\u2019s BitPay, which collects the Bitcoins owed to its 4,500 merchants and other clients, and forwards to them conventional cash, taking on itself the risk of Bitcoin value volatility. To be sure, the Bitcoin exists in the same cultish ethos as gold, whose most zealous adulators believe today\u2019s \u201cfiat\u201d money, as they deride the stuff printed and backed by governments, could become worthless by government whim. Mind you, it\u2019s the same rapture felt by the early evangelists of the PC and later the Internet, who turned out to be so close to the mark in their forecasts that this new century is defined as the Information Age.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nBitcoins have so far existed at the margins of mainstream economics. And so it hasn\u2019t been readily apparent, as perhaps it should be, that some form of global economic currency is the inevitable next step in a globally interconnected financial system in which millions of transactions and trillions of dollars each day have long taken place in pixels, not cash. Electronic banking as a Main Street reality made its advent about a decade ago and e-commerce has followed, adopted by an increasing number of vendors as varied as florists, apparel merchants and car dealerships. Why not an electronic currency, recognized worldwide, to fill out what\u2019s already an overwhelmingly electronic financial world? The early champions of Bitcoin are a diverse group. They include the major institutional investor Fortress Investment Group, which manages $62 billion in conventional investments; venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a heavy investor in Bitcoin-related startups who is still best-known for having helped pioneer Netscape, the first reliable Internet browser; and the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, Bitcoin venture investors last seen being outfoxed by Mark Zuckerberg in the Facebook docudrama The Social Network. A motley crew, possibly. But also arguing in Bitcoin\u2019s defence is Robert Shiller. The Yale economist was among the few to predict the dot-com collapse in the late 1990s, and among the fewer still to warn of the unprecedented U.S. housing collapse that triggered the Great Recession. \u201cSomething good can arise from [Bitcoin\u2019s] innovations \u2014 even if the results are very different from its current form,\u201d Shiller wrote in a New York Times essay on the heels of the Mt. Gox implosion, when there were obvious doubts about the nascent currency\u2019s future. \u201cElectronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management.\u201d To this point, the Bitcoin has had a Wild West feel to it. But regulators in Europe, Japan and the U.S. are moving quickly in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox collapse to rein in Bitcoin trading, requiring Bitcoin banks and trading houses to make detailed records of trades and report high-value transactions just as conventional financial institutions are required to do. The improvements in financial-transaction activity that Bitcoin has identified are undeniably attractive. You can access your Bitcoin account with your 12-character password using your smartphone or other computing device from anywhere on the planet at any time of day. And there are no transaction costs. Commercial banks make most of their profits from transaction fees \u2014 you\u2019ve likely noticed it can cost you $21.50 to withdraw $20 from an ATM. It\u2019s estimated that payments and other banking transactions will generate $1.1 trillion a year in a decade\u2019s time, about double the current amount. That\u2019s a lot of honey to attract techies who can design a new payments system that strips out the speculators and standardizes payments across today\u2019s multitude of national currencies. Indeed, the durability of peer-to-peer Internet sharing of music and movies is a comparison often made to the inevitability of electronic currency that removes the middleman and his cut. Cameron Winklevoss claims that \u201cTo shut down Bitcoin, you\u2019d have to shut down the Internet.\u201d Well, no. But if a means can be perfected of curbing the proliferation of banking fees, one would have some difficulty silencing the clamour for that kind of progress.\n\nRead more about:", "132": "NEW YORK (PIX11) \u2014 After another fatality along Metro-North Railroad tracks, the agency\u2019s new safety protocols are being reviewed and questioned.\n\nMetro-North says James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, died at Mt.

Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife. The thing is, the FTC hadn't received the letter yet, and Sanchez didn't post the letter on her website until a month later -- but backdated it for good measure.\n\nAnother letter, supposedly written by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also appeared on Ackman's anti-Herbalife website before the senator's press release. Markey's letter to the FTC and Securities and Exchange Commission caused Herbalife's stock to drop by 14 percent.\n\nAckman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife \u2014 including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn. The other firm is run by a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Robert Walker.\n\nBut wait, there's more!

In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the products outside the network.\n\nAckman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists, data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.\n\nIn October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.\n\nThe group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton, specializes in Latino outreach.\n\nAckman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities. Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens, which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife, echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month that it does not target members of minorities or low income communities.\n\nThe battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's fate.\n\nIn the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut down illegal businesses before.\n\nSEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has previously probed whether statements made about a business are \"materially false or misleading, including statements regarding the compensation levels.\"\n\nAckman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.\n\nAckman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent in the last year.

ATU, however, is circulating a list of 130 reported incidents dating to May 2010 that it says have been intentionally hidden from the public.\n\nOperations managers at the transit agency say most of the cases \u2013 dozens of incidents of riders spitting on drivers, for example \u2013 don\u2019t meet the legal definition of assault and many reports were later found to be unsubstantiated.\n\n\u201cThe ATU leadership\u2019s accusations are inaccurate and the document (supplied by the union) contains just initial information inputted by a controller or dispatcher,\u201d said Roberta Altstadt, a TriMet spokeswoman, in an email.\n\nFair or not, the ATU\u2019s \u201clist of invisible assaults,\u201d which is it says it plans to make public, is demonstrative of how the union is taking its fight to keep its generous health-care benefits to the people. The public, said Bruce Hansen, ATU 757 president, needs to know about the on-the-job hazards that operators face every day.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason that we need the (health care) benefits that we have fought for,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cFailing to record theses assaults goes to show how TriMet tries to deceive the public, whether its with operator assaults or wages.\u201d\n\nOf course, not all of the \u201creported assaults\u201d on documents shared with The Oregonian involve weapons or flying fists. In fact, the average person would probably dismiss many of them \u2013 thrown cups of coffee, spitting and a snowball thrown through an open driver\u2019s window \u2013 as small potatoes.\n\n<a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7866985/\">Do you thinking spitting at bus driver should be considered assault?</a>\n\nBut ATU claims bus drivers consider them attacks that make it hard for them to safely ferry passengers in the Portland metro area, while destroying morale on the job.\n\nWhat's more, Hansen said, TriMet needs to start taking spit attacks more seriously, especially since some diseases can be transmitted by saliva if it gets in a driver's eye or mouth.\n\nUnder Oregon law, spitting on a law enforcement or corrections officer is classified as assault. But the statute doesn't apply to other public employees.\n\n\n\nHansen said other incidents on the list clearly cross a line that TriMet isn\u2019t willing to acknowledge. In one case, a driver reported that she asked a man who was vomiting at the back of a bus to step off. A woman traveling with the man reportedly responded by shoving the driver and throwing paper towels drenched with vomit at her.\n\n\u201cThat one just disgusted me when I saw it,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nAltstadt said the agency takes reports of menacing or physical attacks against its drivers seriously. But TriMet, she said, doesn\u2019t determine definitions of crimes. Police analysts, guided by the FBI\u2019s Uniformed Crime Reporting, define many of the initial calls on the list don't meet the definition of assault -- even if they're found to be true.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpitting \u2013 even in the face \u2013 is generally categorized as harassment but may be categorized as an assault by the PPB crime records specialist depending on the full details of the incident,\u201d she said.\n\nIn countless cases, Altstadt said, harassment, assaults and concerns about weapons on the transit system turn out to be baseless.\n\nAs an example, Altstadt recalled a recent report from a train operator who said a rider spotted an elderly woman in a trailing car who apparently had a \u201cshotgun.\u201d In the end, it turned out to be a cane.\n\n\u201cOur staff looks into each security related incident -- again, crime or not -- to see how security might be improved,\u201d Altstadt said. \u201cWe are also transparent about reported crimes on our system.\u201d\n\nOn the long list of incidents being circulated by the ATU to the media, the most common type is passengers spitting at drivers. (Not surprisingly, most reported confrontations result from bus drivers simply asking free-loaders to pay their fare.)\n\nWhether or not you believe the next contract with TriMet union workers should maintain the most generous public-employee health benefits in Oregon, the ATU list serves as a reminder that your bus driver deserves a big \u201cthank you\u201d during the evening commute.\n\nOf course, you might want to think twice about trying to hug him or her. One of the reported assaults was an unwanted kiss.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete list of reported incidents -- which TriMet says are largely unverified initial calls -- broken down by type from May 2010 to the end of 2013:\n\nSpitting: 65 reported.\n\nPunch, hit, slap, shove, grab: 48.\n\nAssault with fluid (coffee, soda, water, beer): 8.\n\nFinger or fingernail poke: 4.\n\nStabbing: 3.\n\nAssault with bicycle: 2.\n\nAssault with wallet or purse: 2.\n\nSnow ball: 1.\n\nVomit assault: 1.\n\nFlying rock: 1.\n\nHit by car: 1.\n\nStick: 1.\n\nTrash can: 1.\n\nBrushed arm: 1.\n\nAssault by bus door: 1.\n\nCoins: 1.\n\n\u201cPatted on head by rider\u201d: 1.\n\n-- Joseph Rose\n\n\n\n\n\n", "154": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \ufffd Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.\n\nNearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise \ufffd the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released today by the American Public Transportation Association.\n\nTransit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession.

As public transportation becomes more popular, and as cities spend more money on expanding it, transit systems are opening earlier and closing later.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when you said, \u2018I want to live near a good school district,\u2019\u201d Moss says. \u201cToday, people want to live near a good transit connection.\u201d\n\nMoss is referring to young people especially, who are ever less likely to own cars.\n\nFeatured in: Marketplace Morning Report for Monday, March 10, 2014", "162": "We\u2019ve recently covered the news that more people are foregoing car ownership than ever before, so it would make sense that public transit is becoming more and more popular at the same time. Now there\u2019s data to prove it.\n\nThe American Public Transportation Association\u2019s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.\n\nThis time around high gas prices aren\u2019t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times:\n\n\u201cNow gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,\u201d Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.\u201d\n\nFrom 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association\u2019s data.\n\nCities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at \u201coff-peak\u201d times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported. Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.\n\nThese are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.", "163": "More Americans boarded public buses, trains and subways in 2013 than at any time since the suburbs began booming nearly 60 years ago, found a study published Monday by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).\n\nNearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise \u2014 the highest total since 1956. While the number of national vehicle miles traveled on roads increased 0.3 percent, public transportation use in 2013 increased by 1.1 percent, according to the study.\n\n\u201cAs the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,\u201d Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of the Grand Rapids\u2019 transit authority in Michigan, said in a press release.\n\n\u201cPublic transportation systems nationwide \u2014 in small, medium, and large communities \u2014 saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers.\u201d\n\nExpanding bus and train networks and increased service helped spur the growth, as did the nation's urban shift, the report found. Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent, outpacing both population growth and the number of vehicle miles traveled on roads.\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities,\u201d said Michael Melaniphy, APTA president. \"People are making a fundamental shift to having options\" aside from a car in how they get around, he added. \"This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip.\"\n\nThe economic recovery is another driver behind the increase in transit ridership. Nearly 60 percent of trips taken on public transportation in 2013 were for work commutes, the study found.\n\nTransit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.\n\nHeavy rail (subways and elevated trains) ridership saw the biggest jump with 2.8 percent nationally in 2013. Increased service during peak hours in Miami accounted for the bulk of the jump, increasing local usage by 10.6 percent. Commuter rails also became more popular as ridership increased 2.1 percent nationally. A new rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 2012, registered more than double the number of passengers compared to last year. Light rail systems, such as modern streetcars, trolleys and heritage trolleys, usage increased 1.6 percent, according to the study.\n\nNationally, bus ridership remained stable, declining by 0.1 percent. But in cities with a population of below 100,000, the number of passengers increased by 3.8 percent.\n\nDemand-response ridership, a flexible mode of public transit that doesn\u2019t follow fixed routes or schedules, such as shared taxi or minibuses that pickup and deposit passengers along the way, increased by 0.5 percent in 2013.\n\nOverall, the sprawling city of Houston had a large ridership gain. So did Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.\n\nTransit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.\n\n\"People want to work and live along transit lines,\" Melaniphy said. \"Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.\"\n\nAl Jazeera and The Associated Press", "164": "A Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train pulls away from the Rockridge station in Oakland.

Chinese exports plunged tanked by a shocking 18.1% leading to a 23 billion dollar trade deficit. The markets are trying to adjust to a shaky new Lunar New Year. Oh sure some blame the holiday but after getting one China company default it is possible that China is headed towards a very hard landing.\n\nThe reason why this is so shocking is just one month ago China trade expanded by 10.6%. We saw copper imports were soaring. Still China Copper Imports were up January through February was up 41.2% but in February fell 29%. It looks like copper buyers loaded up on supply fearing what traders\n\nChina\u2019s consumer prices rose 2% in February at their slowest rate in 13 months.

Producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month by dropping 2 percent, slightly above forecasts for a 1.9 percent drop leading to more concerns that China is having a hard time keeping things together.\n\nAdd to that Japan revised down its growth estimate for the final three months of last year after announcing a record current account deficit for January. Japan\u2019s Cabinet Office said both private and public demand was lower than its earlier estimate.\n\nReuters is reporting that armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorized sale of oil from a rebel-held port. A North Korean-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, docked on Saturday at the port of Es Sider and local daily al-Wasat said it had loaded $36 million of crude oil. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the military will bomb the 37,000-tonne vessel if it tries to leave.\n\nOfficials said on Sunday that the navy and pro-government militias had dispatched boats to stop it from getting out. The rebels said any attack on the tanker would be \u201ca declaration of war.\u201d The escalating conflict over the country\u2019s oil wealth is a sign of mounting chaos in Libya, where the government has failed to rein in fighters who helped oust veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and who now defy state authority.\n\nThe protesters, who also include former soldiers and ex-oil guards led by a former anti-Gaddafi commander, Ibrahim Jathran, have seized three eastern ports in the OPEC member country. The Defense Ministry issued orders to the chief of staff, air force and navy to deal with the tanker. \u201cThe order authorizes the use of force and puts the responsibility for any resulting damage on the ship owner,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cSeveral navy boats have been dispatched. Now the tanker\u2019s movements are under complete control and nobody can move it,\u201d said Culture Minister Habib al-Amin, who acts as informal government spokesman. \u201cThe tanker will stay where it is. \u201cAll efforts are being undertaken to stop and seize the tanker, if necessary by a (military) strike, if it does not follow orders,\u201d he said, adding that state prosecutors would treat the loading of the crude as smuggling. There was no sign of any immediate military action, but Libyan news websites showed some small boats close to a tanker which they said was the Morning Glory. Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled him.\n\nWell at least the break in the price of oil may break gas prices that have been on the rise. Trilby Lundberg reported that the average U.S. price per gallon for regular gasoline is now almost $3.51, the highest since last September. Diesel fuel prices also rose, increasing by 2.58 cents from two weeks earlier to an average $4.0323 per gallon. The blame goes to higher \u201cethanol\u201d prices, stemming in part from the unrest in Ukraine. Corn is a major export for the Ukraine and a rally in Corn and a drought in Brazil have grains hopping. Corn is pulling back a bit. According to the survey, the lowest average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in the U.S. is $3.18 in Jackson, Mississippi.

Lenders would take control of the Melville, New York-based company under a \"pre-packaged\" Chapter 11 reorganization, which Sbarro on Monday said could allow it to made a \"quick exit\" from bankruptcy before May 7. Sbarro expects to cut its debt load by more than 80 percent, and said nearly all its lenders support its restructuring, which requires court approval. The company will invite other buyers to submit better offers. Founded in 1956, Sbarro had tried to boost sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor \"fast casual\" chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. But an \"unprecedented decline in mall traffic\" and an \"unsustainable\" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing. \"Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model,\" said Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York. \"Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order.\" The company said it recently closed more than 180 money-losing restaurants, and expects to shed about 50 more locations. It said it now has 799 restaurants in over 40 countries, employing more than 2,700 people. Sbarro said the bankruptcy does not affect the 582 restaurants owned by franchisees. Last month, the company announced plans to close 155 of its 400 company-owned restaurants in North America. Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy. It expanded in the New York City area before launching in 1967 its typical restaurant format, which includes an open kitchen and lets customers serve themselves. NECESSARY STEP Sbarro and 33 affiliates filed for protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The company reported assets of $175.4 million and liabilities of $165.2 million. It plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization. Advisers include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

I'm not 100 percent sure,\" Juan Pablo admitted to Nikki, who nodded her head in reply but seemed upset by the news.\n\n\n\n\"But at the same time, I am 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot -- a lot. So, Nikki, would you accept my final rose?\" Juan Pablo asked her.\n\n\n\nNikki, again, nodded her head. After hesitating for a moment, she replied, \"Absolutely,\" and kissed him. Juan Pablo thanked her for accepting his last rose and then jokingly told her not to get cranky since it was so hot outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n's eighteenth-season finale began with the remaining two bachelorettes, Nikki and Clare, meeting Juan Pablo's family in Saint Lucia.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo met up with his mother and father, brother, sister, cousin, niece and his four-year-old daughter Camila. Clare met his family first, and Juan Pablo told the cameras he liked her a lot, their connection was \"on fire\" and she had many qualities he liked.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo just wondered how she'd interact with his family and whether she'd fit in with them. Clare was nervous but hoped Juan Pablo would see an amazing connection between herself and his family. She thought Juan Pablo was so hot with his daughter and it was obvious they loved each other very much.\n\n\n\nClare thought Juan Pablo's family was wonderful, kind and welcoming. Clare told Juan Pablo's relatives she sincerely looked forward to having many children. Clare then asked his mother Nelly whether Juan Pablo has any personality traits he probably wouldn't share with or admit to her, and the mother said he's \"hyperactive\" and \"sometimes very rude.\"\n\n\n\nSomehow, Clare said her feelings for Juan Pablo were reconfirmed after that conversation.\n\n\n\nClare then assured Juan Pablo's cousin Rodolfo she wouldn't run if she encountered any problems with the Bachelor. She said if Juan Pablo proposed to her, it'd be the best day of her life. Rodolfo basically told his cousin that Clare was \"begging\" to marry and have kids with him.\n\nFOLLOW REALITY TV WORLD ON THE ALL-NEW GOOGLE NEWS!\n\nReality TV World is now available on the all-new Google News app and website.

Clare could envision being a part of that family forever, and she said Juan Pablo had stolen her heart.\n\n\n\nLater on, Nikki met Juan Pablo's family and she truly wanted to make a good impression on them. Nikki said it was a fun, whirlwind of an experience and she learned a lot about herself throughout the journey. She felt blessed to have \"met someone really special.\"\n\n\n\nNikki told Juan Pablo's father Saul that the Bachelor wouldn't be who he is today if he hadn't been a father and she loved who he is because of that. Juan Pablo's dad said he's \"not an easy guy,\" suggesting he's a little self-centered and very focused on particular things he wants in life.\n\n\n\nNikki said she knew Juan Pablo was stubborn but she was ready to be with all of him as a person. Juan Pablo's mom also told Nikki her son was a very simple guy who watched TV a lot with his family and daughter. As much as Juan Pablo apparently loves relaxing and watching sports, Nikki said she loved Juan Pablo and was sure he's the guy she had been looking for.\n\n\n\nRodolfo explained to Nikki that while he believed Juan Pablo was a great guy, he knew that the Bachelor ran at any sign of trouble. Juan Pablo apparently walks away and leaves when things get rough in a relationship.\n\n\n\nAfter meeting both girls, Rodrigo thought both girls would be \"a good choice\" for Juan Pablo, who could see a future with both women.\n\n\n\n\"Can I keep both?\" Juan Pablo asked in a confessional.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his final one-on-one date with Clare. He knew there was potential with both women and didn't know what to do. He had a big decision to make. The pair got a beautiful view of Saint Lucia via a helicopter ride. Clare was falling more in love with each passing moment, and Juan Pablo said she was \"sexy, hot and cute.\"\n\n\n\nThe couple then landed at Commerette Point and things suddenly took a drastic turn for the worst.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\"He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear, that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing. I don't even want to repeat it. It was insulting, it was offensive, and it just made me feel awful. Every single woman deserves to be treated with respect. I'm not just an object. Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"\n\n\n\nClare continued, \"I'm so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next. I thought that this was going to be one of the most romantic moments of my life, but it wasn't. Knowing that this was or could be our last date ever, if he can't tell me that he knows me and this relationship goes further than a physical connection, I'm out of here.\"\n\n\n\nThat night, at The Landing hotel, Clare thought about what happened that day when no cameras were on the couple and they didn't have microphones recording their every word.\n\n\n\n\"He leaned over and then he said, 'I feel like we don't know each other. You don't know me. I don't know you.' He chooses not to say something romantic but that he loved hooking up with me. What he said and the words he used, I cant even repeat it,\" Clare said in a confessional.\n\n\n\nClare admitted she felt like she was going down the road of her past relationships again in which the men didn't see more than the physical and didn't really care to have more going on between them than the physical relationship. Clare said she went on the show for love, \"not just a hookup.\"\n\n\n\nClare then invited Juan Pablo to her hotel room to talk and denied him a kiss when he walked in. Juan Pablo seemed like he had no idea what was going on. asked Clare to remind him what he had said wrong in the helicopter, and when Clare mentioned he had brought up things about what happened when they were alone, the Bachelor jumped on the conversation and noted, \"What happens in private stays in private.\"\n\n\n\nClare explained to him how he had said they had good chemistry but didn't know each other well enough. Juan Pablo insisted she misunderstood what he said. Clare noted that what she wants in a relationship is way beyond just the physical.\n\n\n\n\"I don't need the physical anymore,\" Juan Pablo interjected.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo told Clare to her face that there were parts of her that he liked and parts he didn't like and she probably felt the same way about him -- that maybe there were \"many parts\" she wouldn't know and like about him. Clare was taken aback by that, but Juan Pablo said he was just trying to be honest with her. Juan Pablo said it was hard to figure out how he felt given his situation.\n\n\n\nClare told the cameras she could deal with honesty but it just felt like the end. She explained that if Juan Pablo wasn't sure about his feelings for her, she'd be out, because she thought she had a lot to offer a man.\n\n\n\nClare was just confused because she thought they were on the same page prior to the helicopter incident. She was uncertain whether Juan Pablo even wanted to learn more about her and get to know her. She was getting prepared to book a ticket home from Saint Lucia depending on his answers.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo argued that her \"no kissing rule\" earlier in the season in South Korea was the best thing he ever heard, however, he jokingly said she went back on her word and that wasn't his fault. Juan Pablo tried to convince her that he could see himself with her and it was more than just a physical attraction.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\"That's a good question because a proposal for me and my daughter is huge, and I've been thinking for a week already. 'Am I ready?' is my question. 'Do I know the person as much as I know I would love to know somebody?'\" Juan Pablo explained.\n\n\n\nClare told him that's what she wanted to hear. She wanted to hear more than, \"I like kissing you, I like kissing you.\" Juan Pablo said he wanted her there and she was \"special\" to him. He could see them having a baby or two within a couple months if they ended up together, and he assured her that he \"honestly\" felt great with her. Clare was convinced at that point they had \"a lot more\" going on than she feared.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo talked to Clare about what things may be like four months down the road and how they'd deal with being apart while the show aired. Clare seemed to take that as a sure sign he'd pick her in the end.\n\n\n\n\"We had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one. I just know it and I feel really good about that. I like that girl a lot,\" Juan Pablo said in a confessional.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want a rose, I want forever,\" Clare said.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his one-on-one date with Nikki. He knew that Nikki was in love with him, but he needed to figure out his own feelings. Nikki loved him so much but admitted the one thing missing from her fairytale was hearing how Juan Pablo felt about her in return, as she believed he was a \"cautious\" man who was afraid to get hurt.\n\n\n\nNikki then confronted Juan Pablo about how she believed he might be \"a little guarded\" and maybe \"scared to open up.\" star immediately rejected that notion.\n\n\n\n\"When I feel it, I will open up. So, I'm not, I'm not guarded,\" Juan Pablo told her.\n\n\n\nNikki was a little worried about whether Juan Pablo loved her, yet he made her feel very comfortable. She didn't see him having their type of connection with anyone else. Nikki said she'd be \"heartbroken\" if that day was her last day ever with Juan Pablo, but she was trying not to stress it.\n\n\n\nWhen she asked what life would be like after all their fancy dates were over, Juan Pablo said there would be a lot of TV watching -- such as sports -- and he'd do that alone often times. Nikki didn't seem overly alarmed by that statement.\n\n\n\nThat night, the couple talked some more and she needed to hear him say, \"I love you.\" The pair acknowledged how their journey was almost over and Nikki told him the idea of that was a little scary because she was \"head over heels in love with him.\"\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nNikki then gave Juan Pablo a heartfelt, emotional card that he read aloud, once again expressing her love and admiration for him. In response, Juan Pablo kissed her multiple times yet said nothing, and she seemed very sad and unsatisfied. When he left, she broke down into tears on the couch.\n\n\n\nWhen it became time for the season's final Rose Ceremony, both women felt confident they'd end up as Juan Pablo's fiancee. They were looking forward to starting a life with him and ending their fairytales on a high note. Clare was picturing a ring on her left hand, while Nikki noted, \"I know it's me. He can't have what he has with me with anyone else.\"\n\n\n\nClare was the first woman to meet\n\n\n\nClare trusted Juan Pablo and knew everything was going to be okay, because he had always promised her that. Clare acknowledged her deceased father would be very proud of her for opening up, and she didn't think Juan Pablo had any doubts about their relationship when examining their last conversation.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo had little to say at first, so Clare expressed how -- despite all her previous questions and concerns -- she believed in Juan Pablo and knew they had something special.\n\n\n\nAfter telling Clare they had some ups and downs, fixed their issues, and she was still there because he wanted her there, Juan Pablo broke the bad news.\n\n\n\n\"You are unbelievable, such an amazing woman. Um, I wish the earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever. I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along, and I've been very honest since the beginning to everybody that, at some point, some people are going to go home. I have to follow what I think is best for me, and I have to say goodbye to you,\" Juan Pablo told Clare.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo tried to wrap his arms around Clare and embrace her, but she coldly rejected the gesture.\n\n\n\n\"This entire time, I stuck around because I believed in you. The other night on our last date, when we spent our last hour together, I needed that reassurance, and I gave you that opportunity right then because I've been scared to death. And for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento, that you can see yourself if we got together and had our babies -- I wanted to do it because I believed in us. I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you are,\" Clare calmly said with tears in her eyes.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo tried to interrupt her, but Clare snapped, \"I'm not done.\"\n\n\n\n\"And [\n\n\n\n\"Do you know how I feel? Do you know when I made my decision?\" Juan Pablo asked the bachelorette.\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me,\" Clare said as she walked away. \"I lost respect for you, because I'll tell you what, I thought I knew what kind of man you are. What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,\" Clare said.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo just kept repeating \"okay\" throughout her speech as if he didn't really care about anything she was saying.\n\n\n\n\"Oof, I'm glad I didn't pick her,\" Juan Pablo said after she left. \"Oof.\"\n\n\n\nIn her final words, Clare repeated some of the statements she had already made to Juan Pablo. She truly had faith in him and so it was very disappointing. She never ran even when she wanted to and felt weak.\n\n\n\n\"It's easy to just kiss and show your feelings. But don't tell me you 'love f-cking me.' Don't tell me that,\" Clare told the cameras.\n\n\n\n\"That, to me, is not a man... Don't tell me how much your family loved me. Just don't say anything. Don't say anything. I know it's about following your heart. I know it's about standing up for what you want... But right now, it just hurts my heart. Where is the man that makes me feel like I'm worth it, the man who would fight for me? Where is that man who would fight for me?\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo, according to\n\n\n\nAfterward, Chris walked Nikki to Juan Pablo once she arrived at the quiet beach. She wondered whether the day might not go as she had planned, but she knew there was a great chance she'd end up engaged and she really wanted that.\n\n\n\nNikki couldn't imagine what Juan Pablo was going through and couldn't wait to hear everything she had been waiting for him to say. Nikki wanted to hear that he loved her and she was anticipating it would be the best day of her life.\n\n\n\nOnce they were face to face, Nikki thanked Juan Pablo for everything and said their experience had been amazing and he was an amazing person. She said she wanted to be a part of his family and his life. Nikki noted she never felt that way before about anyone and she didn't expect to feel that way, but she was glad she did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.\n\n\n\n\"I can't imagine spending my life without you. I don't want it to stop and I don't think it will. I love you,\" Nikki told Juan Pablo.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo had tears in his eyes and took a deep breath. He told Nikki that he loved so many things about her -- how she cared about other people, her honesty, her ability to be a good stepmom to Camila, and how every time with her was a perfect time.\n\n\n\nHowever, Juan Pablo reiterated how her father had demanded he only propose if he was completely 100 percent sure of Nikki and the decision he was making. It then became very apparent that Juan Pablo was not certain he wanted to be engaged to his final bachelorette. That's when he gave Nikki his final rose.\n\n\n\nDuring : After the Final Rose special, Clare admitted to\n\n\n\nClare explained her heart was open and her guard was down, which is why she didn't leave him. She thought he was serious about marriage but got the closure she needed by unloading on Juan Pablo the day of the finale. Clare didn't care to see him again in person because she didn't want to be fed anymore \"B-S.\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo then sat in the hotseat and told Chris he did what he felt was right for him and things worked out the way they were supposed to. He said he didn't know what he was going to do that day of the finale yet he had no regrets about Clare. Juan Pablo also said he was \"being himself\" in the helicopter with Clare when she complained he had made \"offensive\" comments.\n\n\n\nNikki then got onstage and said she's still in love with Juan Pablo and things are going great between them. Juan Pablo apparently has yet to say, \"I love you,\" back, but Nikki explained his actions speak louder than words. She admitted it's been a struggle that Juan Pablo opts out of saying, \"I love you,\" but at the same time, she was sure he was invested in their relationship and dedicated to making it work.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo explained he was looking forward to no longer having to hide their relationship, as things were hush-hush over the last four months since filming concluded. He noted they're now happy and free and he feels \"fantastic\" about Nikki. After Chris kept probing Juan Pablo to open up about Nikki more, the host just came out with the question everyone was wondering.\n\n\n\n\"So you love her?\" Chris asked Juan Pablo very bluntly.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that question to you. I don't get it. I don't get it,\" Juan Pablo replied.\n\n\n\n\"People don't understand that this is real life. When you're with somebody, you don't say you love her or not if you're there or not... Whenever you feel you love someone, you [say it]... We are done with the show. We are so done and very happy that we had the opportunity to be part of it and that we met each other through it. I appreciate the opportunity... It's been tough. You guys have been boxing with me... It hasn't been easy.\"\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo said he's just been honest with people all along, and Nikki is okay with everything because she realized they had \"a real relationship.\" They kept repeating how happy they are and Nikki said only time will tell if Juan Pablo falls in love with her.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo gave no answers about what's next for them but admitted there had been a \"drastic change of plans\" after he learned something from the show's producers about two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nWhile Juan Pablo declined to elaborate further, his comments appeared to refer to prior reports that he had been expecting to follow the footsteps of former Bachelor\n\n\n\n\"Another season of has come to an end. Not going to lie, I'm okay moving on,\" Chris said later on.\n\n\n\nThe special concluded with Chris confirming Andi is the next ette star. She's \"speechless\" about the opportunity and definitely \"looking to find that great love.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you fall in love, don't be afraid to say that,\" Chris told Andi in a sarcastic tone, clearly taking a shot at Juan Pablo.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW REALITY TV WORLD ON GOOGLE NEWS star Juan Pablo Galavis picked Nikki Ferrell as his final bachelorette -- but didn't propose marriage or reveal his love to her -- during Monday night's finale broadcast of the eighteenth season of the ABC reality dating show.Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, MO, received Juan Pablo's final rose and the phrase, \"I like you a lot,\" from star.\"Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket, but I'm not going to use it. I'm not 100 percent sure,\" Juan Pablo admitted to Nikki, who nodded her head in reply but seemed upset by the news.\"But at the same time, I am 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot -- a lot. So, Nikki, would you accept my final rose?\" Juan Pablo asked her.Nikki, again, nodded her head. After hesitating for a moment, she replied, \"Absolutely,\" and kissed him. Juan Pablo thanked her for accepting his last rose and then jokingly told her not to get cranky since it was so hot outside. Clare Crawley , a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, CA, finished as the heartbroken yet angry runner-up.'s eighteenth-season finale began with the remaining two bachelorettes, Nikki and Clare, meeting Juan Pablo's family in Saint Lucia.Juan Pablo met up with his mother and father, brother, sister, cousin, niece and his four-year-old daughter Camila. Clare met his family first, and Juan Pablo told the cameras he liked her a lot, their connection was \"on fire\" and she had many qualities he liked.Juan Pablo just wondered how she'd interact with his family and whether she'd fit in with them. Clare was nervous but hoped Juan Pablo would see an amazing connection between herself and his family. She thought Juan Pablo was so hot with his daughter and it was obvious they loved each other very much.Clare thought Juan Pablo's family was wonderful, kind and welcoming. Clare told Juan Pablo's relatives she sincerely looked forward to having many children. Clare then asked his mother Nelly whether Juan Pablo has any personality traits he probably wouldn't share with or admit to her, and the mother said he's \"hyperactive\" and \"sometimes very rude.\"Somehow, Clare said her feelings for Juan Pablo were reconfirmed after that conversation.Clare then assured Juan Pablo's cousin Rodolfo she wouldn't run if she encountered any problems with the Bachelor. She said if Juan Pablo proposed to her, it'd be the best day of her life. Rodolfo basically told his cousin that Clare was \"begging\" to marry and have kids with him.Rodolfo told him to go \"all in\" if he felt he had found a wife, and Juan Pablo's brother Rodrigo thought Clare was super sincere and down to earth, a perfect fit for him. Clare could envision being a part of that family forever, and she said Juan Pablo had stolen her heart.Later on, Nikki met Juan Pablo's family and she truly wanted to make a good impression on them. Nikki said it was a fun, whirlwind of an experience and she learned a lot about herself throughout the journey. She felt blessed to have \"met someone really special.\"Nikki told Juan Pablo's father Saul that the Bachelor wouldn't be who he is today if he hadn't been a father and she loved who he is because of that. Juan Pablo's dad said he's \"not an easy guy,\" suggesting he's a little self-centered and very focused on particular things he wants in life.Nikki said she knew Juan Pablo was stubborn but she was ready to be with all of him as a person. Juan Pablo's mom also told Nikki her son was a very simple guy who watched TV a lot with his family and daughter. As much as Juan Pablo apparently loves relaxing and watching sports, Nikki said she loved Juan Pablo and was sure he's the guy she had been looking for.Rodolfo explained to Nikki that while he believed Juan Pablo was a great guy, he knew that the Bachelor ran at any sign of trouble. Juan Pablo apparently walks away and leaves when things get rough in a relationship.After meeting both girls, Rodrigo thought both girls would be \"a good choice\" for Juan Pablo, who could see a future with both women.\"Can I keep both?\" Juan Pablo asked in a confessional.The next day, Juan Pablo embarked on his final one-on-one date with Clare. He knew there was potential with both women and didn't know what to do. He had a big decision to make. The pair got a beautiful view of Saint Lucia via a helicopter ride. Clare was falling more in love with each passing moment, and Juan Pablo said she was \"sexy, hot and cute.\"The couple then landed at Commerette Point and things suddenly took a drastic turn for the worst.\"So as the helicopter's landing, Juan Pablo and I have a rare moment together with no cameras, nobody there with us -- except the pilot -- and Juan Pablo leaned over and whispered something to me. But what I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. I'm just shocked. It's just something that he said in that moment to me, I almost don't have words for it -- how I feel right now,\" Clare told the cameras.\"He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear, that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing. I don't even want to repeat it. It was insulting, it was offensive, and it just made me feel awful. Every single woman deserves to be treated with respect. I'm not just an object. Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"Clare continued, \"I'm so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next. I thought that this was going to be one of the most romantic moments of my life, but it wasn't. Knowing that this was or could be our last date ever, if he can't tell me that he knows me and this relationship goes further than a physical connection, I'm out of here.\"That night, at The Landing hotel, Clare thought about what happened that day when no cameras were on the couple and they didn't have microphones recording their every word.\"He leaned over and then he said, 'I feel like we don't know each other. You don't know me. I don't know you.' He chooses not to say something romantic but that he loved hooking up with me. What he said and the words he used, I cant even repeat it,\" Clare said in a confessional.Clare admitted she felt like she was going down the road of her past relationships again in which the men didn't see more than the physical and didn't really care to have more going on between them than the physical relationship. Clare said she went on the show for love, \"not just a hookup.\"Clare then invited Juan Pablo to her hotel room to talk and denied him a kiss when he walked in. Juan Pablo seemed like he had no idea what was going on. asked Clare to remind him what he had said wrong in the helicopter, and when Clare mentioned he had brought up things about what happened when they were alone, the Bachelor jumped on the conversation and noted, \"What happens in private stays in private.\"Clare explained to him how he had said they had good chemistry but didn't know each other well enough.

Clare was taken aback by that, but Juan Pablo said he was just trying to be honest with her. Juan Pablo said it was hard to figure out how he felt given his situation.Clare told the cameras she could deal with honesty but it just felt like the end. She explained that if Juan Pablo wasn't sure about his feelings for her, she'd be out, because she thought she had a lot to offer a man.Clare was just confused because she thought they were on the same page prior to the helicopter incident.

Not going to lie, I'm okay moving on,\" Chris said later on.The special concluded with Chris confirming Andi is the next ette star. She's \"speechless\" about the opportunity and definitely \"looking to find that great love.\"\"If you fall in love, don't be afraid to say that,\" Chris told Andi in a sarcastic tone, clearly taking a shot at Juan Pablo.

But not this time around!\n\nClare Crowley has had enough of Juan Pablo Galavis. After he sent her home during the season 18 finale of The Bachelor, she realized he wasn\u2019t at all who she wanted. So, when Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to see him, she flat out said no.\n\nClare Crawley Refuses To See Juan Pablo\n\nWe\u2019ve got to say \u2014 go Clare! When Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to bring out Juan Pablo, she admitted that she had thought about that.[hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25702266\u2033][hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25661214\u2033]\n\n\u201cLooking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me, because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think so many women can relate to that where you want to have hope, and you give it chance after chance, and it was so liberating to be able to stand there and say, \u2018this is exactly how I feel\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s not okay.\u2019 To be able to stand there, to be able to say every word and how I felt, and get it all out there that day in St. Lucia \u2014 that was my closure.

And although the dress was fitted, it still managed to look flowing, which is a credit to the 26-year-old winner\u2019s rocking bod and extremely long, graceful legs.\n\nEven though Juan Pablo didn\u2019t propose to Nikki in the end of the show, she still won him over more than any of the other ladies \u2014 which is not surprising, considering how stunning she is!

Did he propose?\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nGalavis ended up picking Nikki over Clare but did NOT propose to her. Check out 5 highlights from the two-hour episode (also check out PHOTOS).\n\n1. The women meet Juan Pablo's family\n\nThe finale was set in beautiful St. Lucia, the scene of a past episode. Clare and Nikki each got a chance to meet Galavis' parents and cousin Rodolfo. The women seem enamored by watching Galavis interact with his daughter. Clare gushes to his family about how she can't wait to be a mother and wants four children.\n\n\"I could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo's family forever,\" she later says.\n\nAs for Nikki, she says she's nervous because she knows Galavis' family is really important to him. She had met his parents and daughter in a previous episode.\n\nNikki rattles off all the places they've visited during the season. Galavis' daughter seems bored.\n\nGalavis loves to talk about how honest he is. Honestly must run in his family -- key words Galavis' mother used to describe him include \"hyperactive -- super hyperactive\" and sometimes \"very rude.\"\n\n\"He's not an easy guy,\" Galavis' dad says about his son, while speaking to Nikki. \"I'm telling you because he's vocalized in what he wants. He's always very specific in what he wants. He thinks he [knows] the truth in everything.\"\n\n\"Juan Pablo ... I mean I love the guy -- he's a really great guy -- but sometimes, when things are getting rough, he'll walk away from the relationship,\" Rodolfo tells Nikki.\n\nI feel like we would fight well together,\" Nikki jokes.\n\n2. WHAT did Juan Pablo Galavis tell Clare?\n\nGalavis goes on a final date with each of the contestants. Clare says that during theirs, while they were in a helicopter, he told her something off-camera \"that no woman wants to hear.\"\n\n\"[He said] that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing I don't even want to repeat,\" she said. \"It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.\"\n\n\"I'm not just an object,\" she added. \"Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.\"\n\nClare, who, by the way, is the contestant Galavis famously frolicked with in the ocean during a past date (nothing more than PG-13 was shown on TV), later confronts Galavis about it. They start a very serious conversation, during which he stroked her leg, and she tells him she wants their relationship to be more than just physical. He tells her they have more than just a physical attraction. \"I like what I have seen during the entire adventure,\" he says.\n\n\"'Am I ready?' is my question,\" Galavis said. \"'Do I know the person?'\"\n\nClare's anger over his past offensive remarks appears to melt away. She is already daydreaming about that ring. (Heck, she's practically daydreaming about hanging out at the jewelry store, picking out bridal necklaces, after dropping off the ring to be resized because that's what happens a LOT when men pick out rings.)\n\n\"That's what I want to hear,\" she says. \"That's the kind of stuff I want to hear. I wanna hear about more than like, 'I like kissing you, I like kissing you.' I know it gets tough after this. I know it's gonna be hard after this. If I am gonna be with somebody, I want them to know that they want to be with me.\"\n\nGot all that? Who said relationships are complicated?\n\n3. Love letter\n\nNikki, by contrast, seems far less dramatic than Clare, and a lot more pensive and possibly naive.\n\n\"I'm in love with this guy,\" she says. \"I want forever with him.\"\n\nHe reads a mushy handwritten letter she wrote to him (flashback: \"The Babysitter's Club,\" Kristy), makes out with her a bit more and then leaves. She sits on a coach, crying.\n\nFYI to single women: Alpha-males LOVE love letters.*\n\n4. Clare finally stands up for herself because ...\n\nSeriously, Clare is so over the mysterious offensive comment and is ready to get engaged. Babies. She's probably ready for babies. She stands in front of Galavis in a one-shoulder teal gown on a beach, holding his hand, waiting.\n\n\"I wish ... I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,\" he says. \"... I have to say goodbye to you.\"\n\nUh oh.\n\nThen she lets him have it.\n\n\"I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you and I thought I knew what kind of man you were,\" she says.\n\nGalavis graciously offers to tell her the precise moment he decided not to choose her. She finally stands up for herself and declines.\n\n\"Doesn't matter to me,\" she says. \"I lost respect for you. I'll tell you what. I thought I knew what kind of man you were. What you just made me go though ... I would never want my children having a father like you.\"\n\nAfter she walks away, Galavis says: \"Whew. I'm glad I didn't pick her.\"\n\n5. Thanks DAD!!!\n\nHost Chris Harrison, who is standing in front of a live studio audience partially populated by former \"Bachelor\" and \"Bachelorette\" couples as well as current eliminated contestants, reveals that Galavis DID pick out a diamond engagement ring. It was designed by Neil Lane, which follows \"Bachelor\" and \"Bachelorette\" tradition. Will Nikki get it?\n\nDressed in a cobalt blue gown with a thigh-high slit, she walks up to Galavis.\n\n\"I can't wait to tell my mom, like, 'Mom, I'm engaged,\" she is heard narrating.\n\nTo Galavis, she says he is an amazing person and that she has waited a long time for this \"once-of-a-lifetime\" moment and that she cannot imagine spending her life without him.\n\n\"I love you,\" she says.\n\n\"Whew,\" he says. \"Just know that I love so many things about you.\"\n\nUh oh.\n\nGalavis told her that when her father told him (in a previous episode) that he should only propose to Nikki if he was absolutely sure about it, that made him \"think a lot.\"\n\n\"And honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not gonna use it,\" Galavis says, twisting the knife he just stabbed in Nikki's heart. 'Uh uh. I'm not 100 percent sure that I wanna propose to you. At the same time, I'm 100 percent sure that I just don't wanna let you go.\"\n\nThen, the final blow.\n\n\"I like you a lot,\" he continues. \"A lot.\"\n\nAnd he gives her a consolation prize -- hint -- she's got a collection of them.\n\nGalavis gave Nikki a rose.\n\n\"Nikki will you accept my final rose?\" he asks.\n\nShe nods. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nIgnoring the naked, chilly feeling on her ring finger, she makes out with him a bit while clutching the rose. Think she'll keep it in a flower press with the words \"Worst consolation prize ever\" scrawled on it?\n\n\"The Bachelor: After The Final Rose\"\n\nClare declined invitation to confront Juan Pablo Galavis\n\n\n\nDuring the live \"After The Final Rose\" segment, which aired after the finale, Harrison offered Clare the chance to confront Galavis about his rejection of her, in front of the eager studio audience.\n\n\n\n\"Looking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before and I think so many women can relate to that, where you want to have hope, you give it chance after chance,\" she says.\n\n\n\nClare says that moment gave her closure.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more B.S.,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThat's too bad, because it would have made for entertaining TV, Clare.\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis talks about rejecting Clare\n\n\n\n\"To me, it was very hard to say to people and honestly, at the end of the day, I made the decision that I thought was good for me,\" he says. \"It is what it is.\" Regarding Clare, he says: \"We had rollercoasters and we lived through out and it worked out the way it worked out.\"\n\n\n\nHe refused to reveal what he told Clare during their date, which she found offensive.\n\n\n\n\"People have private conversations,\" he says. \"From my mouth, nothing is gonna come out. It's something that is personal.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have nothing bad to talk about Clare,\" he adds. \"She was great -- she was there for a reason.\"\n\nNikki: He hasn't said 'I love you' (RUN! RUN AWAY!)\n\n\n\n\"We've been really happy,\" she tells Harrison, cheerfully. \"It's been great.\"\n\n\n\n\"Has he told you he loves you?\" he asks.\n\n\n\n\"Not exactly,\" she replies. \"I know that he does. I've never told someone I love them first so it's been a struggle. If he wasn't invested in this relationship and making this work, he wouldn't be with me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not gonna force it,\" she adds. \"It's on his time and I'm happy in a relationship and I know he is too, so I feel like that should matter more than anything.\"\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis humiliates his non-fiancee on national television\n\n\n\nGalavis then joins her on the couch. Harrison asks them how they are doing.\n\n\n\n\"I think we're doing great,\" he says.\n\n\n\nI feel fantastic about this woman,\" he adds, saying that it's time for them to continue their private relationship.\n\n\n\n\"Chris I feel great, like I said,\" he says. \"So I'm very honest to her and I keep things to ourselves and I show her how I feel about her and she's happy with that.\"\n\n\n\nNikki remains silent, smiling politely as Galavis drones on about how it's been \"tough\" and then scolds Harrison for interrupting him earlier in the show.\n\n\n\nSean Lowe, the star of season 17 of \"The Bachelor\" who recently wed Catherine Giudici, who won, offers his opinion on the whole situation.\n\n\n\n\"When I'm in love, I want that person to know it,\" he says (brags?), adding: \"To each their own.\"\n\nHow long is Nikki going to remain in a relationship with Juan Pablo Galavis?\n\n\n\nWhen asked this by Harrison, Nikki replies: \"As long as it feels right, I'll give it that length of time. Once it doesn't feel right, I think I' m gonna be out. But it feels right.\" \"We have plans,\" Galavis adds. \"Now we're gonna figure it out in our private life.\"\n\nAs he has said many times: Ay-ay-ay.\n\nAlso on \"The Bachelor: After The Final Rose,\" the new star of the upcoming season of \"The Bachelorette\" was revealed.

Vote in our poll, below.", "204": "If tonight\u2019s Twitter reaction is any indication, Juan Pablo Galavis has effectively sealed his fate as The Bachelor\u2018s most despised contestant ever.\n\nWe had to do our own background research to provide you the background, so here goes: Galavis had previously drawn outrage for comments about a potential gay Bachelor being \u201ctoo hard to watch\u201d because homosexuals tend to be \u201cmore pervert.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince then, his tenure with the show has been marred by battles with executive producers over those comments, and his general on-air behavior. But his actions in tonight\u2019s finale took home the prize for odiousness, according to the internet.\n\nApparently Galavis\u2019 selection between the top two choices to receive a proposal for marriage (What even is this show?) ended in an incredibly awkward fashion: One girl went home in tears, while the winner was given a non-proposal, told he \u201cliked\u201d her, and offered a rose as consolation of some sort.\n\nFlash forward to the live, in-studio conversation between Galavis, the winner Nikki Ferrell, and host Chris Harrison. Galavis accused his host of repeatedly interrupting him, while refusing to go anywhere near saying he \u201cloves\u201d Ferrell, even though the 26-year-old woman has said multiple times that she has fallen \u201cin love\u201d with him. The audience boos, previous Bachelors chime in to rebuke Galavis \u2014 the whole thing is bizarre, even from an outsider perspective.\n\nIf you need any further proof of how much this man is now despised, just look at the tweets here.

He chose Ferrell over rival finalist Clare Crawley, who had strong words for him after being rejected in the final rose ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the reunion show after the telecast, Ferrell said she was relieved that the show was over. She said she's still in a relationship with Galavis, something they've struggled to keep secret.\n\nShe also revealed that while she loves him, he's never told her that he loves her back. He also declined a multiple opportunities to tell Nikki that he loved her during the reunion show.\n\nFerrell said that Juan Pablo's actions speak louder than words.\n\n\"If he wasn't invested in the relationship, he wouldn't be with me,\" she said.\n\nDuring their home visit to Kansas City, Galavis and Ferrell visited Oklahoma Joe's BBQ and a bar at Kansas City's Power and Light District.\n\nFerrell and Galavis didn't reveal what their next plans were or whether they planned to continue to live in separate cities. Galavis said he wanted to keep the future details of their relationship private.\n\nFerrell's friends gathered at a home in Westwood, Kan., to watch the finale.\n\n\"It's very strange,\" said friend Carol McGinness. \"At the beginning of this before she went, a group of got together and gave her some advice and just kind of celebrated this journey she was going on, and so finally getting to the end and being able to have open conversations with her and talk about it and be excited with her in a whole different way is really exciting.\"\n\nAlertMe", "206": "Warning: Massive Bachelor season 18 spoilers ahead! If you haven't yet seen the March 10 season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis' season of the Bachelor, don't continue reading!\n\nIn what will surely be one of the most contested, debated Bachelor seasons ever \u2014 so many tears! \u2014 season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis gave out his final rose to one, er, lucky lady. In the end, the polarizing 32-year-old Venezuelan-born hunk's final choice was between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. So which \"lucky\" lady got the final rose? Let's recap!\n\nPHOTOS: Juan Pablo's bachelorettes\n\nThe action begins in St. Lucia, with both Clare, 32, and Nikki, 26, meeting Juan Pablo's straight-talking family. Clare's up first, and she wastes no time before telling Juan Pablo's mom, Nelly, that she's in love with her son. Nelly, in turn, answers honestly when Clare asks if Juan Pablo has any ticks she should know about. \"He's hyperactive,\" she replies. \"He sometimes is very rude.\" Juan Pablo's cousin Rodolfo has some harsh truths for Clare, too, telling her that the man she's in love with is the kind of guy who will walk away when things \"get rough.\" None of this changes Clare's feelings, though; she maintains that it'll be \"the best day of [her] life\" if Juan Pablo proposes.\n\nNikki gets more of the same from Juan Pablo's family. \"He's not an easy guy,\" Juan Pablo's father warns her. \"It's always about what he wants.\" To drive the point home, Nelly tells Nikki that the fantasies she has of their life together \u2014 game nights and family beach trips \u2014 are just that. \"You feel he is the kind of guy you want?\" Nelly asks. \"You're sure?\" Nikki insists she is, but it's kind of hard to believe, given that even Juan Pablo's family doesn't seem to like him all that much.\n\nPHOTOS: Bachelor proposals, promise rings and breakups\n\nMoving on to the final one-on-one dates! Clare's up first again, and she happily joins Juan Pablo on a helicopter ride over St. Lucia. Somewhere between takeoff and landing, though, the \"happily\" part goes away. Once on solid ground again, Clare reveals Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear that she can't bear to even repeat. \"What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth, and I'm shocked, she says. \"He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he doesn't know me and some sexual thing I don't want to repeat. It was insulting and it was offensive\u2026Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man I thought he was.\"\n\nLater that night, in her hotel room, she confronts Juan Pablo about what he said to her. He deflects any blame from himself and tries to gloss over the situation by saying that he's just struggling with the decision he has to make between her and Nikki. He also assures Clare that she's special to him, and even goes so far as to say that if they end up together, they'll have a baby in no time. \"Now it's like I know it's definitely a lot more than physical attraction between us,\" she says in a confessional, apparently satisfied with his explanation. \"Tonight, I know that he wants me here.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Failed reality TV romances\n\nAh, but what about tomorrow? Nikki's final one-on-one date is up next, and she and Juan Pablo can't keep their hands off each other. There's a lot of making out \u2014 but what Nikki really wants is for Juan Pablo to tell her he loves her. \"I'm in love with this guy,\" she gushes. \"I want forever with him. I do!\"\n\nThe question, of course, is whether he wants the same thing with her. Fortunately, she doesn't have to wait long to find out. After a brief commercial break, the camera zooms in on Juan Pablo at the final rose ceremony, where he's waiting to meet Clare. He feeds her some platitudes about how \"unbelievable\" and \"amazing\" she is, and then cuts to the chase: \"I wish the earth sucked me today, because this is the hardest decision.\" Clare is heartbroken \u2014 but more than that, she's angry, and she rejects Juan Pablo's goodbye hug. \"I've saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,\" she says bitterly. \"What you just made me go through \u2014 I would never want my children having a father like you.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Bachelor stars' scandalous pasts\n\nJuan Pablo's response? \"Whoo! I'm glad I didn't pick her.\"\n\nSo how does he feel about the woman he did pick? Lukewarm, apparently. Though he \"chooses\" Nikki at the final rose ceremony, he's not quite ready to tell her he loves her. \"I love how much you care about other people,\" he begins. \"I love your honesty, so much\u2026I can see you as a good stepmom for Camila.\" That said, he's not ready to see her as a good wife for himself. \"I have a ring in my pocket, but I'm not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you,\" he confesses. \"But I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot.\"\n\nGood enough! \"Nikki, will you accept my final rose?\" he asks. \"Absolutely,\" she replies.\n\nEnd scene!

Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?\n\n\n\nWhen host Chris Harrison announced on The Bachelorette\u2019s \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice.\n\nUnlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.\n\n\n\n\"You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time,\" Harrison tells TVGuide.com\n\n\n\nHeading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its \"Juan-uary\" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a three-year ratings high for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo infamously said in an interview that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were \"more pervert.\" The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo posted an apology, but the dust never really settled.\n\n\n\nA couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's late-night swim with Clare, which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer Sharleen exited just before hometown dates saying, \"There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me.\"\n\n\n\nDuring fantasy suite week, Andi also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show.\n\n\n\n\"I've done more interviews \u2014 random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times \u2014 about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera,\" Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the \"Women Tell All\" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star.\n\n\n\nBut has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star Sean Lowe, who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant Catherine on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of Ben Flajnik\u2019s Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of \u201cThe Voice\u201d are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.)\n\nSo, is Juan Pablo truly a \"bad\" Bachelor? \"I don't know how you answer that,\" Harrison says. \"Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.\n\n\n\n\"We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion,\" Harrison continues. \"Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. \"We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera,\" Harrison says. \"We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was.\"\n\n\n\nSo, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? \"I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor,\" Harrison says. \"It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next.\"\n\n\n\nThe Bachelor's three-hour finale airs on Monday at 8/7c on ABC.", "208": "Talk about a dig \u2014 literally.

After Andi Dorfman went off on him after the over night dates, she took to Instagram to actually mock him wiping something off her face.\n\n\n\nThen she captioned it with, \u201cees ok,\u201d mocking his accent.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no secret that he\u2019s not a favorite. \u201cThe reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous,\u201d an insider told the magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s always actively looking for money and work.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the diss HollywoodLifers?

Perhaps that will come later.\n\nNikki told El Bachelor how much she loved him and he replied by thanking her and telling her that there are many things that he loves about her.\n\nHe then recalled how her father told him to be 100 percent sure before issuing a proposal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I\u2019m 100 percent sure that I don\u2019t want to let you go,\u201d he told her, adding, \u201cI like you a lot. A lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?\u201d\n\nShe nodded and said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nHis decision left Clare Crawley, 32, the sensitive hairstylist from Sacramento, out in the cold \u2014 and very, very bitter.\n\nAfter breaking the bad news to Clare (\u201cI have to say goodbye to you\u201d), he moved in for a hug, but she fended him off \u2014 a move that drew cheers from the in-studio crowd watching a feed of the finale.\n\n\u201cI saved this moment for the man of my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you were.\u201d\n\nThen she drove in the final dagger, hissing, \u201cI lost respect for you. \u2026 What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you.\u201d More cheers.\n\nAfter Clare stormed off, El Bachelor breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cHooo. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her.\u201d\n\nClassy guy.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Clare admitted that she was \u201cfalling in love\u201d and said she could envision herself as part of J Pab\u2019s family \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nOr not.\n\nActually, there were bad signs for Clare during her final date with J Pab. On a helicopter ride, with the cameras off, she said he told her something \u201cinsulting and offensive\u201d that made her feel like an \u201cobject.\u201d It was a \u201csexual thing,\u201d she added. (Apparently about how he enjoyed hooking up with her).\n\nAlso on Monday, we learned who will be our next \u201cBachelorette.\u201d During the \u201cAfter the Rose\u201d special, it was announced that Andi Dorfman, the 26-year-old district attorney from Atlanta will be handing out the roses. She became a fan favorite after she told off J Pab and left the show.\n\nDorfman made the final 3, but decided to leave after her overnight date in St. Lucia, where J Pab told her she made it to this stage by \u201cdefault.\u201d\n\nLike we said, classy guy.\n\nJuan Pablo was deemed by many fans to be the \u201cworst\u201d Bachelor ever. During the turbulent season, he stirred controversy by making intolerant remarks about gay people, and he was occasionally rude and dismissive toward some of the women. Many fans considered himself too blunt, too complacent, too arrogant, and worst of all, too boring.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s finale, even some members of El Bachelor\u2019s family raised red flags about him. His brother, for one, spoke of how he tends to walk away from relationships when things get \u201crough.\u201d\n\nBut how do you feel? Do you think J Pab and Nikki have what it takes to form a lasting partnership? And do you believe she\u2019d be a good mother to his young daughter, Camila?

The Bachelor spoilers have long indicated that Juan Pablo doesn't ask his final female to marry him, and even more spoilers than that indicate that Juan Pablo and his lady haven't even survived through the After the Final Rose ceremony.\n\nAre the spoilers correct? Let's watch The Bachelor finale and find out...\n\nChris Harrison enters the live studio full of people eager to watch The Bachelor finale live. He calls it \"one of the most dramatic and surprising\" finales ever. Just like every other finale. Minus 5.\n\n\"The controversy around Juan Pablo is unlike anything we've ever seen before.\" Oh, REEEEEAAAALLLLLY, Chris Harrison. Really.\n\nJuan Pablo's entire family has been flown to St. Lucia where Nikki and Clare will meet them all. His sister even flew in from Venezuela.\n\nClare's going to meet the parents first. Juan Pablo says his physical attraction to Clare is \"on fire.\" Vomit. Minus 2.\n\nThe only redeeming thing about Juan Pablo at this point is his relationship with his daughter. The only thing.\n\nHis family finds out that Clare's mother is Mexican and everyone in her family speaks Spanish except for her. She loses points in their eyes with that. She totally does.\n\nJuan Pablo's mom sits down with Clare and Clare tells the Mama that she feels love for Juan Pablo. Then Mama says \"ask me anything\" like she's on Reddit.\n\nClare asks about his personality and Mama says he's hyperactive. That's...not personality? Minus 2.\n\nOhhh, there we go.\n\n\"He sometimes is very rude.\" TRUE STORY, MAMA. True story. Clare is EXCITED to learn that she's been RIGHT about him being RUDE. What kind of bizarro world does this woman live in?\n\nRodolfo, the cousin with the braces, says that sometimes Juan Pablo walks away in relationships when things get rough. Can Clare keep holding on if Juan Pablo is walking away?\n\nRodolfo and Juan Pablo chat and Rodolfo tells Juan Pablo that Clare is basically \"begging\" for an engagement and babies.\n\nAwww, Juan Pablo's dad tells Clare that he would love any children she brought to their family and that if Juan Pablo chooses her, she'll have a dad. It's pretty sweet. Plus 10.\n\nChris reminds us that this will be the most controversial finale in history and then asks how many people think Juan Pablo chooses Clare. About 5 people cheer.\n\nAnd now it's Nikki's turn to meet Juan Pablo's family again.\n\nThere he goes with Camila and his niece again! It's adorable! Why didn't ABC just give him a show hanging out with his daughter?? Plus 8.\n\nNikki's nervous to meet Juan Pablo's family again because this time she'll be hanging out with them.\n\nPapa talks to Nikki first and she says that Camila has made Juan Pablo who he is today. She wants a relationship with both Juan Pablo and Camila and Papa says it won't be easy. Juan Pablo isn't an easy guy. He's \"focalized\" on what he wants.\n\n\"He think he knew the truth of everything.\" Papa gets more points for speaking the REAL truth. Plus 12.\n\nIn her conversation with Mama, Nikki says \"love\" approximately 8 times in 2 minutes. Mama tells Nikki that Juan Pablo is a simple guy, happy to stay home and watch TV on the weekends.\n\nNikki talks to Rodolfo and tells him that she's in love with Juan Pablo. He's asking the tough questions, which explains why he's here. He wants to know, again, how Nikki would deal with Juan Pablo walking away or fighting.\n\n\"I think we would fight well,\" she says.\n\nIt's time for the final dates before Juan Pablo makes his decision. He doesn't know what he's going to do, so he starts by taking Clare on a date.\n\nShe comes running across a field toward him and they take a helicopter ride to see St. Lucia from the air. Or they would do that if they could ever stop kissing.\n\nShe's \"on cloud 9.\" BAAARF. Minus 10. Juan Pablo says she's \"sexy, she's cute, she kisses...hot...aye aye aye...\" Baaaaaarrrrrf. Minus 12.\n\nAs the helicopter is landing, Juan Pablo leans over with no cameras or other people around and whispers in Clare's ear something that she says \"no woman wants to hear.\"\n\nHe says that he really doesn't know her and then says something \"sexual\" that she \"really doesn't even want to repeat.\" It's offensive and insulting and she's \"not just an object.\"\n\nHe said \"I feel like we don't know each other.\" And that he loved hooking up with her, but not in those words. She won't repeat the words he used.\n\nShe won't kiss him when he walks into her apartment and instead just asks him to sit. Plus 7\n\nShe's so awkward when she says \"I want to talk to you\" like she's trying to smile and NOT be mad when she apparently really should be mad. It's weird.\n\nHe says that he didn't mean \"I don't know you at all.\" What he MEANT was that he doesn't know her enough. He doesn't know either of them enough.\n\nHe says there are parts of her he likes and probably parts of her he doesn't like because he doesn't know those parts yet. She doesn't take that well, but he kind of has a point. He turns the tables and says there are probably lots of things she doesn't know about him and won't like either.\n\nClare's ready to walk if Juan Pablo is only in it with her for their chemistry.\n\nHe tells her that the best thing she ever did was instill the \"no kissing\" rule that lasted from Los Angeles to South Korea, so approximately one week. Minus 3.\n\nJuan Pablo lists the things he does like about Clare and then tells her he has spent a week thinking about whether or not he can actually propose to either of them because it's about more than just him.\n\nHe smooth talks his way back into her heart. She goes ahead and talks about marriage. Minus 15.\n\nNow it's time for Nikki's final date. Will Juan Pablo whisper sweet inappropriate nothings in her ear?\n\nShe walks up in a bikini ready to hop on a boat with Juan Pablo for the day. She's looking for openness and sharing and probably isn't going to get it. She'll get \"honesty\" though.\n\nNikki tells Juan Pablo that he's guarded and he says \"no, I'm not guarded.\" Minus 8. No one would blame him if he was.\n\n\"What's going to happen when you don't have private islands anymore,\" Nikki asks. \"I'll have a bed and a TV,\" he replies. Oh, okay then.\n\nShe really, really wants him to tell her that he loves her. Until he tells her he loves her, she won't be able to settle down for this date. He doesn't do much to reassure her other than telling her it's going to be okay. But she \"wants forever with him.\"\n\nShe gives him a picture of the two of them and a sweet, heartfelt letter. He kisses her on the forehead and then says he'll see her tomorrow.\n\nOUCH. Minus 18.\n\nAfter he leaves she sits down on her couch and has a good cry.\n\nThe day has come when Juan Pablo has to make his final choice. The girls are getting dressed in their finest and Juan Pablo looks dapper in a navy suit.\n\nOh, look. Posed shots of the women on balconies looking out over the ocean! Minus 2.\n\nBoth women are certain Juan Pablo is going to propose to them. Clare closes her eyes as she rides on a boat and gets her perfectly curled hair completely windblown.\n\n\"It has to be me!\" they both say! But it can only be one of them.\n\nClare gets off her boat first and Chris Harrison escorts her to see Juan Pablo. She says there were times she wanted to bolt and times that scared her to death. But she's standing there right now because they have something special and she believes in him.\n\nJuan Pablo remembers the first time he saw Clare, when she got out of the limo with the fake belly and says she's there because he wanted her to be there. She's \"unbelievable...such an amazing woman.\"\n\nThen he says \"I wish the earth sucked me today.\" (Not gonna lie. I laughed at that.)\n\nHe sends her home as gently as he can and goes in for a hug but she puts her hands up and stops him. She tells him that she gave him an out two nights ago and he didn't take it.\n\n\"You had every opportunity to tell me how you feel,\" she says. \"Do you know how I feel?\" he replies. \"Do you know when I made my decision?\"\n\n\"I don't care.\" And then she says she'd never want a man like him to be the father of her children and walks away.\n\n\"I'm glad I didn't pick her\" he says, after she's out of earshot. OMG! Minus 75. (But we're all glad you didn't pick her, too.)\n\nNow Juan Pablo waits for Nikki with his Neil Lane diamond engagement ring. (It's gorgeous.) She treks across the sand in her high heels and Chris Harrison escorts her in.\n\nShe's excited for the possibility that she's getting engaged, last night's tears a distant memory.\n\nNikki starts by thanking him for the experiences, but she should really be thanking ABC. She wants him to be a part of her life and wants to be a part of his. Nikki can't imagine spending her life without him.\n\n\"Nikki, I love so many things about you...\" NOT THE SAME, JUAN PABLO. Minus 25\n\nHe recalls a conversation with her dad and says he isn't 100% sure that he wants to propose but he is 100% sure that he doesn't want to let her go.\n\nHe gives her a rose instead of a ring.\n\nThat's a respectable move coming from just about anyone other than Juan Pablo.\n\nAnd now it's time for the After the Final Rose live chat.\n\n\"Why was 'I like you a lot' enough for Nikki,\" Chris Harrison asks. Hopefully we'll find out at some point in the next hour.\n\nFirst we have to talk to Clare. Watching everything back for the first time was hard and brought back the sting of the day Juan Pablo sent her home.\n\nClare is a compulsive lip-licker and I would really like to hand her a tube of Chapstick while also knowing what lipstick she's wearing that it doesn't wipe off with all the lip-licking she does when she's nervous. minus 2\n\nShe admits she should have left after he offended her in the helicopter in St. Lucia but she trusted that this was the real deal.\n\nChris asks if she'd like to confront Juan Pablo and she talks about how laying all of her emotions on the line when she left in St. Lucia was all the closure she needed. She doesn't want to sit on the couch and get fed \"anymore BS.\" Plus 48.\n\nKelly leans over to whisper something to Sharleen. What did she say!?!?\n\nJuan Pablo finally makes his way out and Chris asks him about Clare. He just says he made the decision he had to make for himself.\n\nChris asks him if he has any regrets about the way things went down on the show and Juan Pablo starts rambling on about how many hours he spent on the show for it to be boiled down to 20 hours of programming and he enjoyed getting to know the women.\n\nChris tries to steer him back to the topic and Juan Pablo goes \"can I talk?\"\n\nMy eyes just did this: O_O\n\nWhen Chris asks him about the helicopter, Juan Pablo says he won't say anything bad about Clare and that what happened in the helicopter stays in the helicopter. He also doesn't know why he should have any regrets.\n\nJuan Pablo leaves the stage and Nikki comes out to sit with Chris. Her hair is looking great. Apparently she and Juan Pablo are still dating and she's still in love with him. But she still doesn't know if he's in love with her. Minus 10.\n\nShe's not going to force him to say \"I love you.\" According to her, they're both happy in their relationship.\n\nJuan Pablo joins Nikki on the stage and she immediately cozies up to him. They've kept their relationship secret for 4 months and now they can go out in public.\n\nChris asks Juan Pablo if he has a big surprise for the night and Juan Pablo says that he doesn't. He talked to the executives and no, he doesn't have any surprises.\n\nChris presses him about the love issue and says she told the world she loves Juan Pablo but he won't say it back. And he won't. He refuses to publicly profess his love.\n\nI can't decide if I like that he won't buckle to Chris Harrison's pressure or don't like it.\n\nSean gives him the side-eye.\n\nJuan Pablo is heated. HEATED. He keeps getting interrupted and doesn't like it and keeps shutting Chris down. There might be flames bursting out of both of their ears right now.\n\nChris asks Sean to speak about his experience. Sean was okay giving up his privacy in a way that Juan Pablo isn't comfortable. Sean couldn't wait to tell Catherine he loved her, but acknowledges that different people work in different ways. Plus 2? I think?\n\nChris is just hung up on being able to say that Nikki and Juan Pablo are in love. Nikki says this is a real relationship and they're taking it very seriously. Juan Pablo says time will tell for the two of them.\n\nFinally, they acknowledge that the end result is what matters and they're happy. Two weeks ago their plans changed so now they're starting their future together in a public relationship. Chris keeps pressing Juan Pablo on what the plans are but Juan Pablo won't tell him. Minus 4\n\nCatherine says this show is about love and tells Juan Pablo not to slap the hand that fed him. Chris tries to host-splain it to Juan Pablo and again pushes the love issue. He says he'd never seen the show before and Sharleen leans over to whisper into Kat's ear.\n\nChris congratulates them and then tells us it's time to meet the new Bachelorette.\n\nANDI DORFMAN!\n\nShe believes she's going to find the love of her life on a reality dating show! Minus 12.\n\nChris makes fun of Juan Pablo by asking Andi if she knows this is going to be on television and giving her a pass to express her emotions on this journey.\n\nAnd with that another season of The Bachelor is done!

Ever?\n\nIt all came down to this on ABC's The Bachelor Season 18 Episode 11, the epic season finale, followed of course by the After the Final Rose special.\n\nWe came into this evening with just two women remaining on this \"journey.\" Would Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become the future Mrs. Juan Pablo Galavis?\n\nThat was the question on everyone's mind heading into the final rose ceremony when, as predicted, Juan Pablo chose one woman and rejected the other.\n\nSo who won the final rose? Did he propose? And are they even together?\n\nTurns out The Bachelor spoilers were pretty spot on here in 2014.\n\nNot only was the longtime speculation regarding the winner accurate, so were the details surrounding this weird season and how the aftermath played out.\n\nSo who won and who lost (and/or dodged a bullet)? Read on ...\n\nNikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis left St. Lucia as a couple!\n\nThat's right, she got the rose, but El Bachelor didn't propose.\n\nClare Crawley got the heave ho, and Nikki won. But that's it.\n\nAnd yet a lot was revealed on the season finale. Namely:\n\nHe told Nikki he had the ring in his pocket, but he's \"not gonna use it\" 'cause he's \"not 100 percent\" sure he wants to marry her, but \"I like you a lot.\"\n\nSomehow, this was still enough for her to accept the final rose anyway.\n\nHe told Clare that he liked f--king her (?!) at least, or something along those lines that's so offensive she won't even repeat it on the program.\n\nShe can't even bear to look at the guy on the big reunion show tonight.\n\nJuan Pablo has no regrets about the way he handled this whatsoever.\n\nHis big \"surprise\" was that they are still together!

LOLOLOLOLOL View Poll \u00bb\n\nJuan Pablo: The worst Bachelor ever?", "214": "It has been an explosive and dramatic season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Juan Pablo narrowed it down to two women \u2013 Nikki and Clare \u2013 but on Monday only one will remain. Who will Juan Pablo choose to be with? Will Juan Pablo propose? And did he truly come on the show to find love?\n\nMeet The Parents\n\nThe season finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d kicked off in St. Lucia with Clare meeting Juan Pablo\u2019s family for the first time \u2026 and it set off a couple of red flags. At the beginning of their meeting things seemed to be going smoothly with Clare talking about kids and how she can\u2019t wait to be a mother. But it went south when Juan Pablo\u2019s mother told Clare that her son often comes off as rude when he\u2019s being \u201chonest.\u201d\n\nClare brushed off the warning and told his mother that she\u2019s \u201cdefinitely falling in love with him.\u201d But Juan Pablo\u2019s cousin, Rodolfo, also seemed to be hinting that there could be trouble for the pair down the line.\n\nAfter Clare met Juan Pablo\u2019s family it was Nikki\u2019s turn. Nikki initially met Juan Pablo\u2019s parents and his daughter Camila while in Miami, but their meeting was brief and no one had the opportunity to really grill each other. But just like Clare\u2019s meeting, Juan Pablo\u2019s family seemed to only have warnings for Nikki.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an easy guy,\u201d Juan Pablo\u2019s dad tried telling Nikki. \u201cIt\u2019s always very specific in what he wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy you want?\u201d his mom asked her. And when Nikki said yes and asked if Juan Pablo was ready for all of this, all his mother could reply was that she was \u201cpretty sure.\u201d\n\nClare\u2019s Final Date\n\nClare has one final date with Juan Pablo before the rose ceremony and she\u2019s ready to make it count. But events occur that leave her struggling with what to do next.\n\nGoing on a helicopter ride over the ocean, Juan Pablo and Clare are able to have a rare moment together without any cameras or microphones. And while Clare was hoping that he would use that time to whisper some \u201csweet, kind and loving words,\u201d the exact opposite allegedly came out.\n\n\u201cIt was just something that he said in that moment to me,\u201d Clare explained to the cameras after the fact. \u201cI almost don\u2019t have words for it, how I feel right now. He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he really doesn\u2019t know me, and some sexual thing I don\u2019t want to repeat. It was insulting, offensive and it just made me feel awful.\u201d\n\nClare continued that although she can\u2019t repeat it, Juan Pablo said something along the lines of that he didn\u2019t really know her but loved hooking up with her. His offensive comments left her wondering if all they had was a physical relationship, and desperate for answers before she could move any further.\n\nLater that night Clare had the opportunity to explain how she felt to Juan Pablo, and ask him how he truly feels. And while Juan Pablo beat around the bush, he did tell Clare that she\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d to him and that he feels \u201cgreat\u201d about her.\n\nClare drank the punch he was spewing and somehow got out of their conversation that there is more than just a physical attraction between them. \u201cTonight I know that he wants me here,\u201d she told the cameras.\n\nNikki\u2019s Final Date\n\nFor his final date with Nikki, Juan Pablo takes the pediatric nurse on a private yacht for some fun in the sun. Showing up in a bikini, Nikki is set on having Juan Pablo confess his feelings to her. But when Juan Pablo asks if she has any concerns, she doesn\u2019t bring it up.\n\nAfter their romantic date, Juan Pablo visits her at the room. And once again Nikki is desperate to hear that he loves her. But those words never come \u2013 even when Nikki gives him a photo and letter. In the letter Nikki thanks him for the once in a lifetime experience, telling him that she can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings them and that she loves him. And all Juan Pablo can do is thank her and kiss her cheek and forehead before leaving \u2026 leading her to cry after he closes the door.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s Decision With Clare\n\nThe camera shows a ring in Juan Pablo\u2019s hand \u2026 but will he use it? First up is Clare. Arriving by boat, \u201cBachelor\u201d host Chris Harrison walks her in to see Juan Pablo for the final time.\n\nJuan Pablo tells her that since he first saw her \u2013 with the fake belly \u2013 they have had their ups and downs. \u201cYou\u2019re here because I wanted you to be here,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou are unbelievable, such an amazing woman \u2026 I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along.\u201d\n\nHOWEVER, Juan Pablo says that he has to follow what he thinks is best for him. \u201cI will have to say goodbye,\u201d he tells her, going in to hug her. But Clare throws her hands up to put the kibosh on the hug.\n\n\u201cThis entire time I stuck around because I believed in you,\u201d she tells him angrily. \u201cAnd the other night on our last date when you came over and we spent our last hour together. I needed that reassurance and I gave you the opportunity right then\u2026 and for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento.\u201d\n\nJuan Pablo asks if she wants to know why he made his decision, but Clare tells him that it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cI lost respect for you,\u201d she says while walking away. \u201cI would never want my children having a father like you.\u201d\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Juan Pablo says, \u201cOof, glad I didn\u2019t pick her\u201d after she left.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s Decision With Nikki\n\nJuan Pablo has a ring in his hand as Nikki arrives on her boat. The 26-year-old believes that there is a good chance she\u2019ll be engaged by the end of the day \u2026 but will Juan Pablo use the ring to propose?\n\n\u201cI want you to be a part of my life,\u201d she tells him. \u201dI\u2019ve never felt like this before and I didn\u2019t expect to feel this way but I\u2019m really glad I do\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine spending my life without you. I don\u2019t want it to stop and I don\u2019t think it will. I love you.\u201d\n\nJuan Pablo responds that there are many things he loves about her and that\u2019s the reason why he wanted her here. \u201cI could see you as a good stepmom to Camila,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have the qualities.\u201d However Juan Pablo drops a bomb on her \u2013 after speaking with her dad during the hometown date, he\u2019s not 100 percent sure that he wants to propose.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I\u2019m not going to use it,\u201d Juan Pablo continues. \u201cI like you a lot, a lot. So Nikki \u2013 will you accept my final rose?\u201d\n\nAnd while Nikki\u2019s face dropped, she ultimately shakes her head yes and embraces him.", "215": "The March 10 finale of \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 was a roller coaster of emotions and in the end Juan sent Clare home. But Clare didn\u2019t walk away silently, she let Juan know exactly what she thought about him and it was intense!\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis dumped Clare Crawley on the finale of The Bachelor, and instead picked Nikki Ferrell. But the moment he tells her that she\u2019s not the one for him, she literally pushes him away and unleashes a fury of harsh criticisms.\n\n\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season Finale \u2014 Clare Crawley Slams Juan Pablo\n\nJuan told Clare that he didn\u2019t have strong enough feelings to propose and her eyes immediately welled up with tears. It was then that she started to walk away and then turned around and began to slam him.\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25661214\u2033]\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25699018\u2033]\n\nShe said that she was disgusted with what he whispered to her when they got off the helicopter and that she gave him every opportunity to tell her that she wasn\u2019t the one for him. Then she said that he wasn\u2019t genuine and she\u2019d never want to have children with him!\n\nWhen she got back on the boat to ride off into the sunset he said he was happy he didn\u2019t pick her. Wow, how rude!\n\nThe biggest shock was when he picked Nikki but didn\u2019t propose! He said he wasn\u2019t totally certain about her so he gave her a rose instead.\n\nThis entire season has been emotional and many people wonder if Juan was there for the right reasons.\n\nHollywoodLifers, were you surprised Juan sent Clare home?\n\n\u2014 Chloe Melas\n\nMore \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Coverage:", "216": "Season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has finally come to an end, and the winner is Nikki Ferrell but the pair did not get engaged. In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn\u2019t 100% sure. But he claimed he was 100% that he didn\u2019t want to let her go, meaning that Nikki uncomfortably accepted JP\u2019s final rose with him stating that he did not love her, but instead \u201cliked her a lot.\u201d In direct comparison so Juan Pablo\u2019s lack of emotions, before receiving the final rose from Juan Pablo, Nikki delved into a tender monologue professing how much she truly adored him and admitted that she does love him. Even though it\u2019s becoming more and more obvious that Juan Pablo did not come to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d to find a wife, and a stepmother to his daughter Camila, Nikki unfortunately did look truly in love. She was nervous and could barely breathe as Juan Pablo revealed that she would not be able to call her mom and say she was engaged because he was not \u201cgoing to use\u201d the enormous diamond engagement ring.\n\nAs for the Clare and Juan Pablo interaction in this finale episode, the most controversial \u201cBachelor\u201d shows once again that he is not to worlds most sensitive of leading men. When Clare arrives on the beach to meet with Juan Pablo, he does actually look nervous. While at first we thought that his nervousness was due to his genuine attraction for Clare, but now we are assuming it was more because he had led her on for too long and he was worried of her reaction. Clare\u2019s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki\u2019s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what\u2019s to come with Juan Pablo. When she first sees him, she speaks first revealing how she trusts him and believes him, but it seems Clare may have put her eggs in the wrong basket because Juan Pablo does not return her sentiments. Juan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it! Clare looks devastated and doesn\u2019t let him hug her as she turns to leave St. Lucia, but not first without telling him she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Juan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, \u201cWhew! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her,\u201d\n\nWe are thinking that Clare really dodged a bullet with this one, because Juan Pablo is really proving himself to be rather heartless. We truly wish Nikki good luck however just from the Final Rose Ceremony and Nikki\u2019s clearly deflated acceptance of the rose; we are assuming that the relationship won\u2019t last. Juan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d", "217": "Immediately following the season finale of The Bachelor 2014 where Juan Pablo does not present Nikki with the ring or a proposal but the final rose and the words \u201cI like you ALOT\u201d which is enough for her to accept the rose, Chris Harrison brings out Clare to first express her final thoughts and to determine whether or not there is anything she would like to talk to Juan Pablo about.\n\nClare, acting very mature and gathered from her rejection, states she should have followed her gut instinct and left but it was something she wanted so badly only to realize this bachelor is not the man she thought he was or even who he thinks he is. There is nothing left for her to say as the video of that final day is closure enough for her\u2026it is likely that comment he made after she left in addition to her standing up to him which she says was liberating.\n\nAfter the break, Juan Pablo enters the studio in the hot seat expressing relief and stating prayers for what is going on in Venezuela. At the \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d Juan Pablo did not have any regrets. Does he now have any? He is defensive trying to get the point \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d is the comment about Clare and he has no regrets about what he said in the helicopter and glosses over his final remarks to Clare during his goodbye and afterwards but it should be no surprise to the television audience. Juan Pablo has not really taken responsibility for anything adverse this season.\n\nNikki comes out to talk about where things stand with Juan Pablo. She confirms there is a relationship with the bachelor but there is still no confirmation about his feelings for her. For her, it is okay that his actions speak louder than the words she desires to hear. Chris Harrison makes a point about the fact the words have not yet been uttered on Juan Pablo\u2019s part. How long will she be willing to wait?\n\nWhat is Juan Pablo\u2019s surprise? Is he finally going to propose to Nikki or will he break it off with her on national television? It is Nikki onstage with her beloved Juan Pablo. Chris Harrison mentions he stated there is to be a big surprise to which Juan Pablo says it is that they are happy and can now be out in the open after months of waiting for this final show.\n\nChris keeps prying to get the bachelor to open up about his feelings which he continues to run around the bush. Chris asks \u201cDo you love her?\u201d which Juan Pablo remains unable to state the words. Juan tells Harrison he interrupts him as his defense starts to show once more. Shawn Lowe jumps in and states when he knew he was in love with Catherine, he could not wait to tell her with a comment of \u201cto each his own\u201d aimed at Juan Pablo along with the clarifier people handle things in different ways.\n\nChris Harrison does not know what he is looking at; it is a dating situation. Clare defends Juan Pablo and the fact others have been onstage and declared love not there \u2013 which is a great point \u2013 and the relationship they have is real and progressing at the pace they are comfortable. Should audiences judge with suspicion not knowing what is behind closed doors away from the microphones and cameras?\n\nHarrison asks Nikki how long she will wait for the words. She says she will remain as long as it feels right. The relationship changed drastically before \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d but it is not elaborated on and plans are to change beginning now but they are not expressed. Juan Pablo is extremely guarded, defensive, and demeaning to the public which is commented on by Catherine who says \u201cDon\u2019t slap the hand that feeds you.\u201d\n\nIt is confusing and Juan Pablo remains completely oblivious to the dynamics of reality television and delusional, according to Shawn, he is now done with the show and is going to move on with his private life.

And is there a newly engaged couple in the Bachelor family?\n\nJuan Pablo sent Clare home angry and gave the final rose to Nikki \u2013 but he didn\u2019t propose to anyone. Here\u2019s how it all went down:\n\nClare was the first to meet Juan Pablo\u2019s family in St. Lucia \u2013 and she earned their approval. His father Saul practically welcomed her to the family, saying, \u201cI love you\u201d in Spanish.\n\n\u201cJuan Pablo definitely has my heart.

And I was shocked,\u201d Clare said of Juan Pablo\u2019s private whisper when they landed. \u201cHe chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. \u2026 It was insulting.

Still, after brushing aside their doubts, they both doll up and make their walk with Chris Harrison to where the bachelor awaits.

Please do not read any further if you do not want to know what happened on tonight\u2019s show.\n\n******************************************************\n\nClare is the first to come out on \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d to talk to Chris Harrison. Watching the final episode brings back the sting of that day for her and the disappointment she felt in the helicopter after hearing the offensive sexual comment. Clare feels she wore \u201crose-colored glasses,\u201d but she was hopeful as she opened her heart. In hindsight, her gut tells her she should have left The Bachelor 2014 after that incident, but she wanted to hold onto that hope. He wasn\u2019t the man she thought he was, she tells Chris, but it was liberating for her to stand up for herself to him that last day in Saint Lucia. Chris asks if she wants to talk to Juan Pablo; no, she had her closure that day. She doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cfed anymore BS.\u201d Chris respects that. She has all the answers she needs.\n\nChris is going to get The Bachelor Juan Pablo\u2019s side of the story. JP feels relief that he\u2019s back in the real world, although he is upset about what is happening in Venezuela. Chris asks him about Clare. He says it was hard to say goodbye to her, but it was the best decision for him. Any regrets? He enjoyed spending time with the women, but he knows people will get hurt. Is he talking in circles again? Chris focuses him back on Clare. Juan Pablo says it was tough. Chris asks if he would have handled the comments in the helicopter any differently. He\u2019s always honest, he says. It\u2019s their relationship, and it\u2019s personal. He has no regrets about what he said. Dang, is he always right? Can\u2019t he just admit that his comments could be offensive?\n\nTime to talk about Nikki\u2019s experience and lack of a proposal on The Bachelor Season 18. Nikki says that there is still a relationship, and they are very happy. She still doesn\u2019t know if he is in love with her. He doesn\u2019t say it, but his actions show it. Is she being realistic or naive? She seems happy, though, as Juan Pablo is coming out next.\n\nJuan Pablo says they are doing great. He told her dad he wouldn\u2019t propose unless 100% sure, that they would give their relationship a test. Chris asks what his big surprise is. There\u2019s no surprise, JP says, but they are just going to continue their relationship. So no surprise? I feel cheated.\n\nHow do you feel about her, asks Chris. \u201cI feel great,\u201d says Juan Pablo. No \u201cL\u201d word, I guess. He won\u2019t answer the question. He goes on about how happy they are, and they\u2019re not on the show anymore. Then he mentions how Chris interrupted him last time and then says it again. Is anyone else tired of hearing how \u201chonest\u201d he is, how he uses it for an excuse to be rude? So you won\u2019t say you love her, asks Chris? Sean Lowe points out how he couldn\u2019t wait to tell Catherine how he felt about her once he knew he loved her, but to each his own. Looking in his eyes, it seems he wants to say more but is very tactful.\n\nChris Harrison says this is the time for Juan Pablo to express his feelings. Chris doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s looking at. He would like for JP to say that he\u2019s in love, but they can\u2019t seem to have a conversation. Chris feels the audience\u2019s frustration. I hear ya, Chris! Let\u2019s dance all around it, Juan Pablo! Nikki says their relationship is real and that time will tell. They\u2019re just taking it slow.\n\nBack from commercial. Chris sums up that Nikki is in love, he assumes that Juan Pablo is but won\u2019t say it, but they\u2019re happy. How long would she give him to fall in love with her? She will go until it feels right. Do they have plans? Yes, something changed drastically, says Juan Pablo. But of course he won\u2019t share it. What are they going to do next, asks Chris. They have plans, says JP. Sean says it\u2019s public being on the show, but he wants to keep it private. Sean shakes his head; it\u2019s not private after the show, he says. So do they have plans or not? JP won\u2019t say. An obviously frustrated Chris asks Catherine if she were sitting where Nikki is, would she be happy? Catherine says it\u2019s confusing.

El Bachelor \u2014 so named because he is the first-ever Latino to star on the ABC reality show \u2014 gave Nikki the last rose of the season. But because he's not 100 percent sure he wants to marry her, he didn't give her the diamond ring in his pocket.\n\nJuan Pablo sent Clare Crawley, the 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., packing.\n\nJuan Pablo \"broke up\" with Clare before giving the last rose to Nikki. Clare was understandably heartbroken and shocked. She said Juan Pablo is not the man she thought he was.\n\nShe wished that he hadn't strung her along this entire time if he had known his feelings for her weren't there. Earlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.\n\nAs Wetpaint reports, Clare apparently asked Juan Pablo if he loves her.\n\nHis response? \"I really loved f---ing you.\" Clare even repeated the phrase in her reaction to being dumped. That's pretty low, Juan Pablo.\n\nClare said she doesn't even care about his reasons for not choosing her. After she left, Juan Pablo said he was happy he did not choose her.\n\nNikki fully expected a proposal from Juan and seemed ready to accept it. Looks like her own dad's advice \u2014 that he shouldn't propose unless he's totally sure \u2014 really resonated with her man.\n\nIt's probably for the best. Do you think they'll actually end up tying the knot? Will Nikki be a good stepmom to Camila? Only time \u2014 or the hour-long special following the finale \u2014 will tell.\n\nUpdate following \"After the final rose\" special:\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki are still together, but there has been no proposal. Juan Pablo hasn't even said he loves her yet, even though he feels as if he's in love. He seems to have an issue with how public \"The Bachelor\" wants their relationship to be \u2014 does he know he was just on a TV show?\n\nAnd Andi, the district attorney from Atlanta, is the next \"Bachelorette.\" Everyone seemed happy to have the spotlight shift from the awkward Juan Pablo and Nikki to her bubbly, hopeful face. I thought Andi would have been smarter than to accept such an offer, but when you're desperate for love (and see a gigantic check waved in front of your face), I guess it's hard to resist.", "221": "After jet-setting around the globe and doling out dozens of roses, \"Bachelor\" Juan Pablo Galavis gave the last and final rose to 26-year-old pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell over 32-year-old hair stylist Clare Crawley.\n\nBut Juan Pablo did not propose to Nikki and didn't even declare his love for her.\n\n\"I'm not 100 percent sure,\" he told her of proposing. \"I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot.\"\n\n[Related: Is Juan Pablo Galavis the Worst 'Bachelor' Ever?]\n\nThough he had a Neil Lane diamond ring in his pocket, he didn't give it to her. Instead, Juan Pablo gave her the final rose \u2014 and Nikki accepted.\n\n\"We've been really happy, and it's been great,\" Nikki revealed on the \"After the Final Rose\" special. They are together and she's still in love. As to his feelings? \"I don't know.\"\n\nWhen Juan Pablo joined her in the hot seat, he said he was looking forward to starting a normal relationship with Nikki.\n\nHost Chris Harrison asked about a \"big surprise\" that Juan Pablo had planned \u2014 but the \"Bachelor\" denied any such thing (so, no live proposal). He also refused to say that he loves Nikki.\n\n\"This is real life. When you are with somebody, you don't say you love her or not,\" he said. \"It's something that you feel. We are happy right now.\"\n\nHe added, \"We are so done with the show.\"\n\n[Related: Who Is the New 'Bachelorette'?]\n\nNikki was a frontrunner all season, but her bond with Juan Pablo was cemented when she was the first woman to meet his adorable daughter, Camila. Their relationship continued to grow after he met her family in Kansas City.\n\nTheir romance has been unmarked by the drama that characterized Juan Pablo's relationship with the other finalist, Clare. While his chemistry with Clare was off the charts, they clashed after a late night swim that he called a \"mistake\" \u2014 leaving her in tears.\n\nThen, in the finale, things turned rocky again when Juan Pablo made an offensive, off-camera comment to Clare. She confronted him in the evening, asking if their relationship was entirely physical. He assured her that he liked many aspects of her personality and talked Clare off the ledge.\n\nBut when it came to proposal day, Juan Pablo said goodbye to Clare. Angry and hurt, she lashed out at him. \"I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,\" Clare said.\n\n[Related: The Oddest Odd Jobs of 'Bachelor' Contestants]\n\nShe also accused Juan Pablo of not being the man she thought he was. \"What you just made me go through, I would never want my children to have a father like you.\"\n\nAs Clare stomped away, Juan Pablo let out a sigh of relief. \"Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her,\" he breathed. (The live studio audience gasped in dismay.)\n\nWhen it was Nikki's turn, Juan Pablo let her know she was the last woman standing, but that he couldn't get down on one knee. She accepted the final rose anyway.\n\n\"It's OK,\" as Juan Pablo would say.", "222": "UPDATE: Nikki Ferrell wins The Bachelor and gets the final rose.

Watch the Final Rose live on TV Tag here.\n\nThe Bachelor 2014 finale will air tonight and fans will finally get to see who Juan Pablo Galavis will give the final rose to.\n\nWill the bachelor choose Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell?\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis is said to be one of the most controversial bachelors on the show due to the drama that has been caused behind the scenes of the ABC reality show.\n\nAccording to E!Online, producers and crew members of the show have never been so ready for the Bachelor to end. \"It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,\" an insider told E!\n\nAlthough viewers of the show do not know the final results of the show, there are reports that there have been lots of fighting between Juan Pablo and the winner.\n\n\"Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,\" a source said.\n\nThe Bachelor host Christ Harrison recently stated his opinion to TV Guide about the former soccer player. \"Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy. Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, 'OK' or 'perfect,' whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, 'Don't be sad,' and touches their hair.\"\n\nThe Bachelor star recently retweeted a fan's insensitive joke last week which sparked controversy. The joke read: \"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone!

Will there be more drama? Is there a twist the television audience does not see coming until it happens? This is what went down on the proposal episode of \u201cThe Bachelor 2014\u201d as a live studio audience watches with Chris Harrison~\n\nThe bachelorettes are to meet the family of Juan Pablo as they all remain in Saint Lucia following the dramatic leave by Andi who called the bachelor out for being insensitive and not really looking for love, but public adoration. As Nikki has already met Camilla and some of the family on a one-on-one date to a dance recital in Florida, Clare will be the first to be officially introduced as the possible Mrs. Galavis.\n\nAt the introduction, Camilla commands all-encompassing attention as children will in this situation which flowed over to dinner as she sat in his lap. His mother comes right out and asks Clare how she feels about Juan Pablo and how she thinks he feels about her. It is interesting his mother asks about the communication between them commenting on his rudeness that is honest without filter which is exactly how Andi called it.\n\nAs much as Juan Pablo has trigger phrases, so does Clare with her constant \u201c1000%.\u201d His cousin, Roldolfo, makes the remark to Juan Pablo Clare is \u201cbegging\u201d for marriage which is qualified as \u201cready.\u201d Juan Pablo does not get his communication skills from his father who is really gentleman.\n\nThe next day, Nikki meets the relatives as she arrives with flowers and a gift for Camilla who is once more attached to her father. Juan Pablo\u2019s father, Saul, is the first to talk to Nikki who comments on Juan Pablo\u2019s self-centeredness with focus on himself. Afterwards, she talks to his mother and states she would like to be a part of the family in addition to explaining how she would spend time with Camilla on the weekends. His mother believes he is ready for marriage but is a simple guy.\n\nRoldolfo grills Nikki on relationship dysfunction and whether or not she would walk away with arguments being constructive. As she leaves, Nikki receives unrequested kisses from the little girls and leaves the family liking both women. Is she the one? Will either, or both women, pick up on the hinting by his family that Juan Pablo may be destined to bachelorhood?\n\nThere are some alumnus in the audience, including Catherine Giudici (Mrs. Shawn Lowe) and Kelly Travis who both state the women are ignoring the red flags being cast by the family, but in support of the women, Catherine states that at this point, they are not really paying attention to what others are saying but concentrating on their own feelings and relationship with the bachelor. What are the shocking events that make this season more controversial than others besides Juan Pablo\u2019s \u201clost in translation\u201d blunders?\n\nThere is one final one-on-one date with each woman remaining and Juan Pablo is not 100% sure at this point which woman he will choose. The first date is with Clare Crawley. It begins with a helicopter ride around the island. He keeps focusing on Clare\u2019s attractiveness and not really her personality leaving one to wonder what is on his mind and when Clare states Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear when they land on a plateau which was other than sweet nothings she expected, makes one think.\n\nWhat was the whisper about? According to Clare, it was the fact he really doesn\u2019t know her and something intimate but not expressed in a way which makes her feel special\u2026in fact, she cannot repeat it! As they walk hand in hand on a small knoll, she lets the audience know the words were offensive and insulting. It is certain the audience has gotten the hint of what the statement was and one which has been coming for a while based on the kind of attraction he feels toward Clare especially since the sneaking into the ocean rendezvous in Vietnam.\n\nShe feels objectified but should it be surprising? Has she not kind of allowed him to go down that path? She lies on the bed in tears pondering whether his attraction is for a hookup or for marriage. His demeanor is the same as when Andi confronted him two weeks ago as Clare states she wants to talk to him. She asks him what he said in the helicopter and he wants her to remind him setting her on the hook to take the blame once again. He is so superficial and it looks as though Clare might actually be seeing it!\n\nJuan Pablo dances around the topic as Clare tries to get him to admit to his feelings about her one way or another. Clare stops him when he makes a statement that it is hard for him to make the decision of whether or not he knows someone enough to propose. Wow! She let him off the hook and it heads to the physical realm as she remains delusional about this being more than what it is. He plays the song they danced to on their first date when she states it should be their wedding song.\n\nIt is interesting to hear Shawn Lowe speak of Juan Pablo\u2019s tendency to talk in circles without ever really coming out an express honest feelings to anyone.\n\nThe next date is with Nikki. Will it go somewhat similar to the one with Clare? They take off on a catamaran. Nikki passes off the bachelor\u2019s aloofness as caution. The interaction looks forced and as they lie on the beach, Nikki asks what he will do without a private beach and he immediately states he will have a bed, a television, and his office where he can watch sports by himself. She immediately adds \u201cNot always by yourself\u201d once more indicating these women are receiving huge red flags they constantly disregard.\n\nAre these women that desperate for relationships? Are Andi and Sharleen the only two women mature enough to see past the superficial good looks and soothing accent? Juan Pablo goes to Nikki\u2019s room where she is hoping for an \u201cI love you.\u201d She looks confused as he states he is not certain. She gives him a picture of them together on horseback and a card about her feelings. He kisses her forehead but no words are uttered except \u201cI will see you tomorrow.\u201d Heartbreaking! The tears flow as Nikki breaks down.\n\nThe moment of truth has arrived. Both women are enroute to what they hope is the proposal of a lifetime. Nikki is dressed in a sapphire blue gown matching Juan Pablo\u2019s suit while Clare is dressed in an turquoise green dress. The launch arrives and it is\u2026Clare making the walk to Chris Harrison to Juan Pablo where she rattles on and on without him saying a word which is what he should be doing. He goes into a long drawn out rejection which gains the wrath of Clare which he takes in the same fashion as with Andi. As she walks off, she blasts him with \u201cI would never want my children to have a father like you!\u201d\n\nHe stands on the platform completely unfazed by the comment to state \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her!\u201d Seriously? How callous can one man really be? Clare has justification in stating he should never have told her the things he did to turn around and make statements like he did. Sharleen sits in the audience stunned by what she sees.\n\nWill Juan Pablo propose to Nikki? Will she accept if he does? As the show returns from a commercial break, Nikki arrives on the launch, greeted by Chris Harrison and sent to where the bachelor is waiting. As with Clare,, Nikki starts the conversation thanking him for her being at this moment in time feeling the way she does. He cannot say the words \u201cI love you\u201d instead it is how much her loves so many things about especially how honest she is but even though he has a ring in his pocket, he is not going to propose because he is not 100% positive he wants to propose to her but is 100% certain he does not want to let her go as he asks if she will accept the final rose which she does! Unbelievable!\n\nImage courtesy of ShareTV", "225": "Getty Images\n\nTonight, the compelling 18th season of The Bachelor airs and considering how the rest of Juan Pablo's journey has played out, it's sure to be a doozy. Will he pick Nikki? Will he choose Clare? WHAT WILL HAPPEN?! We're eagerly anticipating the episode, but before all of our most pressing questions are answered, here are 13 possible outcomes for tonight's season finale:\n\n1. Juan Pablo proposes to Clare and she accepts. The two live happily ever after with Clare's crazy eyes and JP's total jerkiness.\n\n2. Juan Pablo proposes to Nikki. She accepts. She texts all the rejected women saying \"I WON! HAHA,\" then dumps him.\n\nRelated: What It Felt Like to Watch the Bachelor Slut-Shame a Woman on National TV\n\n3. Juan Pablo proposes to one or both of the women, neither accepts. JP is left to \"swim in the ocean\" by himself, forever.\n\n4. Sharleen comes back because she's still not sure about how she feels. She sings him some opera; he touches her hair. They share some more alarmingly tonguey kisses. She decides she's still just not that into him and leaves again.\n\n5. Chris Harrison locks Juan Pablo in the fantasy suite, declares that this is his moment to shine, and crowns himself the next Bachelor.\n\nRelated: The Most Amazing Moments From 'The Bachelor: The Women Tell All'\n\n6.

Did Juan Pablo get engaged, who wins the Bachelor 2014 tonight, and is there an After the Final Rose engagement surprise? When you tune into tonight\u2019s Bachelor Final Results telecast, and sit back to learn who is the Bachelor 2014 winner, don\u2019t flip your remote control. Bachelor spoilers before tonight\u2019s telecast tell news that the Bachelor final results for March 10, 2014 may have a bigger surprise in the After the Final Rose telecast than in the Final Rose episode itself.\n\nDetails about who wins the Bachelor were revealed last winter. No, Juan Pablo did not get engaged. Yes, Nikki is allegedly the Bachelor 2014 winner. And finally, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together. RealitySteve spoilers claim that, early on in the season, it was clear that Nikki was headed to becoming the winner. But when Juan Pablo picks Nikki in the final minutes of the telecast, he delivers, at least to her, a shocker. According to RealitySteve, Juan Pablo picks Nikki but does not propose. There is no engagement during the final rose, claims RealitySteve, and there is no engagement in the weeks after that episode aired as well.\n\nSo are Juan Pablo and Nikki still together? RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together officially. But reports have claimed that Juan Pablo has been allegedly dating other women, prompting claims that Juan Pablo was cheating on Nikki. Nevertheless, coming into tonight\u2019s After the Final Rose, Juan Pablo is expected to tell ABC viewers that he is happy that he picked Nikki, and that he was reluctant to propose at that time.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 9\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 10\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 11\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 12\n\nBut what about this After the Final Rose Juan Pablo secret engagement?

So does the Juan Pablo secret engagement happen, does Juan Pablo and Nikki get engaged in the After the Final Rose tonight? RealitySteve claims to know that the alleged offer has been made but does not know if the alleged offer has been accepted. That will be revealed tonight.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nFor now, the big surprise may tonight be in the After the Final Rose telecast. But before the season started, RealitySteve said \u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, I think you\u2019re going to hear a lot of things come out about this season, whether it be on my site, or in the tabloids, or coming from some of his girls Twitter and Instagram accounts, that presents overwhelming evidence to the fact that this guy \u2026 was never interested in finding a wife\u201d. Juan Pablo has been called the worse Bachelor ever, even though his ratings have been strong.\n\nBut that could all change tonight with a possible surprise engagement. RealitySteve tweeted moments ago \u201cThe first 90 min of tonight\u2019s show is basically pointless. As is every finale.

So if you already think that this ending is wrong, there\u2019s nothing I can say or do to convince you otherwise. It is what it is.\u201d He adds \u201cOver the next three months, tabloids will run stories, people will email me saying they think I\u2019m wrong, people will have theories on why this happened or that happened. And to that, I\u2019ll take it all in and say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and just move on. Without giving up my sources and where I got this info, I can\u2019t convince anyone who doesn\u2019t want to believe it that this is the correct ending.\u201d\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nHe adds \u201cSome will choose to harp on last season being wrong, and some will choose to look at my track record over the long haul and know I had the previous 7 seasons correct.

Though almost every season has been dubbed \u201cthe most dramatic season ever,\u201d this season might actually take the cake over all others.\n\nWhether you hate or love the show, it is understandable that all viewers complain about current Bachelor Juan Pablo. Whether it is his annoying idioms, his lack of care, or his emotional detachment from everyone but his daughter, Camilia, it has been perhaps the craziest season ever.\n\nJuan Pablo announced what everyone in the world is thinking by taking to his Twitter account to write: \u201cThe day has COME\u2026 Finally TODAY the soap opera comes to an END\u2026.\u201d\n\nEven the bachelor himself agrees that the antics that have evolved over the season have been a little over the top and is looking forward to the end tonight as he chooses between two girls, Clare and Nikki.\n\nClare has been a frontrunner for most of the season, even though she started off the first episode faking a pregnancy when she stepped out of the limo sporting a fake baby bump in her flowing pink gown.\n\nThen there is Nikki, the blonde hair beauty has also been a front runner for most of the season, with Juan Pablo even going so far as to introducing Nikki to his daughter during one of the previous episodes.\n\nAnd the best catch of all? The girls absolutely cannot stand each other, made evident by their ongoing catfights that have ensued all throughout the season.\n\nWhile he has an undeniable connection with both, it will be difficult to guess which lady will end up with the final rose. Will Juan Pablo propose to either of his two contenders? Only tonight will tell in the epic season finale on ABC.", "228": "'The Bachelor' star Juan Pablo Galavis made another insensitive and ignorant remark. Get the scoop!\n\nThe Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis must love the taste of shoe leather, because he can't stop putting his foot in his mouth.\n\nThis time, Galavis' transgression went down on Twitter, where he retweeted an incredibly insensitive, ignorant and, frankly, unfunny joke from a fan.\n\nThe idiotic missive read, \"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don\u2019t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!\"\n\nAside from the obvious -- you know, that it's cruel and wrong to poke fun at the mentally challenged -- whoever came up with this brilliance is also clearly a hypocrite, because most people with an I.Q. in the triple-digits know that \"cupcake\" is one word.\n\nJust like he did when he said that homosexuals are \"more pervert, in a sense,\" Galavis defended himself the only way he knows how: By reminding the world that English isn't his first language. Except this time, Galavis also had the gall to say that his critics need to learn both culture and respect. The irony can be cut with a knife, folks:\n\n\"I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture\"\n\n\"Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES...\"\n\n\"People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...\"\n\n\"In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect\"\n\nWe're going to go out on a limb here and assume Nikki Ferrell is thrilled she didn't get a ring from this troll. On that note, since even bad things seem to be okay with Galavis as long as they're commonly used, by his logic, my going out to buy heroin with counterfeit cash right now would be totally cool, right?\n\nUgh. Take a seat, sir. In fact, rent out a soccer arena and take all the seats.", "229": "The Bachelor 2014 fans\u2013it\u2019s time for the grand finale of The Bachelor Season 18 as we will finally see who The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis chooses. The Bachelor Juan Pablo Spoilers may have already given you a hint\u2013if you\u2019ve read any. Will the bachelor choose Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley? Or neither? Stay tuned right here as we see who was sent home on The Bachelor 2014 during our live recap of tonight\u2019s episode.\n\n\u201cThe Women Tell All\u201d Special episode aired last week, and, boy, oh, boy, did the women of The Bachelor Season 18 really tell all! Many accused The Bachelor Juan Pablo of not really listening to them. Of course, \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d was the phrase that bachelorette Andi Dorfman got sick of hearing. The bachelor seemed nervous and tried to defend himself; at times I even felt sorry for him. Renee Oteri said she had real feelings for him, but she is now seeing someone! I was impressed that Sharleen Joynt defended him, saying that Juan Pablo did try to get to know her and did ask her questions about herself. Who knows? Maybe it depends on who he was really interested in?\n\nTonight, The Bachelor 2014 will answer all our questions. Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for. I\u2019m wondering if The Bachelor Juan Pablo will walk away from both Nikki and Clare. Or maybe he will pick one and then they will be broken up by \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d? What are your predictions?\n\nStay right here as we watch together during our live recap of The Bachelor Season 18\u2019s finale.\n\nWARNING: BACHELOR 2014 SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\nThis post contains The Bachelor Season 18 spoilers for tonight\u2019s show. Please do not read any further if you do not want to know what happened on The Bachelor 2014 tonight.\n\n******************************************************\n\nCurious about all the tears previewed on this final episode of The Bachelor 2014? So am I, as Chris Harrison enters the room to get us started. Of course it\u2019s \u201cone of the most dramatic and surprising finales,\u201d he tells us as always. He does say that The Bachelor Juan Pablo promises us a big surprise. And we will also address tonight whether Juan actually came to the show to find love. We shall soon see!\n\nTime for the girls to meet The Bachelor Juan Pablo\u2019s family in the beautiful Saint Lucia! Clare is excited as she hugs everyone and then meets daughter Camila. She loves watching them together; it makes him even sexier, she says. Clare feels right at home, as they ask her about all the kids she wants to have. She tells his Mom later that she loves him. His mom says her son is hyperactive and can be rude in his communication. Yep, says Clare, he made her cry when they had a disagreement, but they worked it out. The cousin reveals that sometimes JP walks away when things get rough; Clare says she hangs in there. Rodolfo feels she\u2019s sincere as she tears up; he thinks she\u2019s an angel. Hmmm . . . is that a stretch? Dear old dad likes how natural she is and he welcomes her to the family. He will be a dad to her: \u201cTe quiero!\u201d He already loves her? Pretty sweet guy! They love her, but how does The Bachelor Juan Pablo feel?\n\nTime for Nikki to meet the members of the family she hasn\u2019t already met. She talks about the amazing experience on The Bachelor Season 18 and how grateful she is. Nikki answers his dad\u2019s questions, saying that Camila has made Juan Pablo who he is today. His dad also tells her that his son is not easy; he is always sure in thinking that he makes the right decisions. Papa feels that Nikki is mature enough to manage his son, and he gives her a big ole smooch! Nikki tells his mom that she\u2019s in love with Juan Pablo. Mama, too, says that her son isn\u2019t easy, but she thinks that he \u201cmight\u201d be ready. Red flag, anyone?\n\nCousin warns her, too, just as he did with Clare, that JP walks away sometimes during fights. Nikki doesn\u2019t seem to mind. The family thinks she\u2019s strong. But is she their favorite? The Bachelor Juan Pablo wants to keep both, he says. Not an option, says Chris Harrison. Not an option.\n\nChris polls the audience. Views are mixed, as some think it will end badly. A male fan thinks it will end well\u2013with Nikki, who seems more comfortable than Clare does. Some of the women are doubtful since even the family isn\u2019t too confident about Juan Pablo. Kelly, from this season, is concerned about the family\u2019s warnings. Catherine Lowe likes Juan Pablo as a person, but he seems complacent with the situation. And there were red flags; there were no red flags when she met Sean\u2019s family.\n\nChris says the last date with Clare is nothing like we\u2019ve ever seen before, so what does that mean? The Bachelor Juan Pablo talks about how difficult his decision will be, as Clare runs up to him. On the helicopter, they make out for a bit. All he can talk about is how sexy and what a good kisser she is. Right before they land\u2013without cameras, Clare reveals that JP whispered something to her. She\u2019s shocked! Huh? He said something that no woman knows to hear\u2013some sexual thing. She said it was offensive and didn\u2019t want to repeat what he said, but it was something about \u201chooking up\u201d with her. She\u2019s \u201coutta here\u201d if he can\u2019t tell her that he really knows her and their relationship goes beyond a \u201cphysical connection.\u201d\n\nClare plans to find out the truth this evening. Sorry, no besito, Juan Pablo, this girl wants to talk. Clare reminds him of the things they have done in private and that he said to her in the helicopter. He had told her that they didn\u2019t know each other; he now claims that he meant that they don\u2019t know each other well enough. He says that there may be other things they don\u2019t like about each other, and he was just being honest when he whispered in her ear. I can see why Clare is confused, can\u2019t you?\n\nHe does say he loves a lot of things about her, and their relationship is more than just physical. Is he ready, Clare asks? He isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s ready to propose, but if it\u2019s her, he can see them having a baby in a little over a year. By the end of the night, Clare feels good about him wanting her there. They finish the night listening to their song from their first date.\n\nBack in the studio audience, Sharleen says that scene was painful to watch, as Juan Pablo patronized Clare, and she ignored her intuition. Sean Lowe agrees, feeling that the bachelor was talking in circles. For sure!\n\nTime for Nikki\u2019s final date. Will she have doubts, too? Nikki shows up scantily clad, as usual. She, too, does want to hear how The Bachelor Juan Pablo feels about her. He denies to her that he\u2019s \u201cguarded,\u201d and they change the subject. Nikki is bit worried about him being able to open up, but, then again, she also feels so comfortable with him. Will she, too, ignore that nagging voice in her head?\n\nNikki wants to find out during their evening how Juan Pablo feels about her. They talk about how it\u2019s almost over. Nikki admits to being nervous. Juan Pablo says it\u2019s all going \u201cto be okay.\u201d Okay, can we think of something original to say? Nikki gives him a gift\u2013a framed picture with a note from her heart. She says she has never felt this way before. She gets a thank you and kisses but no declaration of love. She looks disappointed and sits down to cry after he leaves. Aw, poor girl.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the last day of The Bachelor Season 18. Funny, they didn\u2019t show The Bachelor picking out a ring, even though he\u2019s holding one. Both Nikki and Clare are talking about their fairy tale endings, knowing that the relationship is right. Well, it can\u2019t be right for both of you, ladies, even though you both feel that.\n\nJuan Pablo seems nervous to me, as Clare is the first to arrive on a boat to be met by Chris Harrison. She reminisces about her dad and is hopeful for what is to come. She speaks first and tells him how she trusts and believes in him. He then talks about their ups and downs and how they fixed them. She is an amazing woman, he says, but he has to say goodbye. She looks terribly hurt and doesn\u2019t allow him to hug her. (I hear clapping from the studio audience.) She tells him that she needed reassurance that last night. She said that she gave him every opportunity to tell her that it wasn\u2019t her instead of telling her he could see them together and having babies together. She says she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Clapping ensues! She meets up with Chris, who hugs and comforts her.\n\n\u201cWhew! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pick her,\u201d says The Bachelor Juan Pablo. OMG! Are you kidding me? How heartless! Oh, poor Nikki, if he does choose you! But will he?\n\nNikki thanks The Bachelor Juan Pablo for everything. He\u2019s amazing, as is his family, and she wants them to be a part of each other\u2019s lives. Juan Pablo loves her honesty and how she cares about people. She would be a good step-mom for Camila. He recalls Nikki\u2019s dad telling him to be 100% sure if he proposes, but, even with the ring in his pocket, he is not 100% sure. He is, though, 100% sure that he doesn\u2019t want to let her go. He likes (I don\u2019t hear \u201cloves\u201d) her a lot and gives her a rose to accept. She does. So what does this mean?\n\nWe\u2019ll see on the \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d Special\u2013right now! Juan Pablo, Nikki, and Clare will all be there!\n\nJoin us tonight on Gossip & Gab for The Bachelor 2014 Recap. Let\u2019s watch together and find out who got eliminated on The Bachelor Season 18!

ABC\n\nSeason 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has been a wild ride for Juan Pablo, but tonight it all comes to an end with the Final Rose Ceremony. After starting the dating competition with 27 women, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down the contestant to two women, and tonight he will give one of these lucky ladies the final rose and possibly even an engagement ring alongside it. So will it be for Juan Pablo, either Clare, the 32-year old hairstylists from Sacramento, California or Nikki, the 26-year old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri. Only time will tell, but both of the women have made serious impact on the Latino single father. So much so that Juan Pablo even introduced his daughter Camila to Nikki while the pair were in Miami.\n\nBut does the family introduction mean that Nikki is the winner of season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and Juan Pablo\u2019s heart? Most likely yes- multiple spoiler reports claim that tonight Nikki goes home with the final rose while Clare only goes home with her bags packed. But the one thing we have heard over and over again is that Juan Pablo didn\u2019t actually propose to Nikki, something that according to Wetpaint, ABC wasn\u2019t too happy about. So even though there is a winner in tonight\u2019s \u201cBachelor\u201d finale, there will most likely be no ring! However, I wouldn\u2019t full rule out Clare just yet. In a deleted scene from tonight\u2019s episode Clare and JP are seen relaxing sweetly together, when the romantic bachelor begins to play a special song for Clare, the moment between the pair is so sweet and tender that she actually starts crying. Then the couple go on to discuss playing the song at their wedding\u2026.hmm certainly sounds like she still has a shot at that final rose.\n\nNo matter who walks away with Juan Pablo and the final rose on the season 18 finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d you know it will be an entertaining one! That's why you must watch the finale tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. or if you can\u2019t watch live on the TV be sure to tune in and watch \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d finale online available via live stream after the live airing on WatchABC.com!", "231": "\n\nLOS ANGELES (LALATE) \u2013 Will After the Final Rose 2014 tonight on The Bachelor feature a Juan Pablo Nikki Ferrell engagement, does Juan Pablo propose to Nikki on ATFR tonight, and will there be surprise Bachelor results tonight March 10, 2014 on ABC? RealitySteve\u2019s Bachelor spoilers claim that Juan Pablo does not propose to Bachelor 2014 winner Nikki Ferrell in tonight\u2019s finale episode. You allegedly won\u2019t see a Juan Pablo engagement during the final taped episode tonight. But RealitySteve tells news that Juan Pablo might propose to Nikki Ferrell on the After the Final Rose telecast, and there might be a surprise engagement.\n\n\n\nAfter the Final Rose telecasts usually deal with subjects like \u201care they still together\u201d,\u201d are they still dating\u201d, and of course \u201care they still engaged\u201d. But RealitySteve recently revealed a shocker about tonight\u2019s telecast. \u201cAccording to my sources, there is a \u2026. offer on the table for Juan Pablo to propose to Nikki on the After the Final Rose show.\u201d\n\nStrangely, RealitySteve tells news that he knows that the alleged offer to Juan Pablo was made but does not know if it was accepted by Juan Pablo. \u201cThat fact absolutely cannot be changed. As for what happens at the live ATFR, I don\u2019t know. I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR.\u201d But he adds \u201cWill he propose? Well, the\u2026. offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting.\u201d\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nTonight\u2019s After the Finale Rose could leave more questions than answers. \u201cI\u2019m sure people will have their thoughts regarding the finale, the ATFR show, and what the future holds.\u201d But Bachelor spoilers have yet to indicate if an engagement has been in the works. Juan Pablo has allegedly been dating other women since the season wrapped filming. So why would consider to propose tonight? \u201cDoes it mean it will for sure happen? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 9\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 10\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 11\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 12\n\nRealitySteve does not indicate how he knows that an alleged offer was made.

Namely, RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo during the season, and in the finale, never wanted to propose to Nikki or any other contestant. \u201cRegardless of if he proposes on the live show or not, the point is\u2026 He\u2019s never going to marry Nikki. Nothing has changed with this guy since the very beginning. He doesn\u2019t want to be married to her, he never wanted to be married to her\u201d. Yet, is he correct?\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 4\n\nBut is the possibly out there? RealitySteve claims so, alleging \u201cJust wanted to give you a heads up since that\u2019s now a possibility at the ATFR. Regardless, he will never marry Nikki in your lifetime or mine, so, I would put zero stock into it if he does propose.

Speculation as to whether or not Galavis is going to propose and to whom abounds, but the former soccer player is right to be nervous. Evil contestant Claire Crawley hasn't been entirely truthful about her restraining order past. Spoilers: Claire's dubious double-dealing with men has got her into a lot of hot water at least once before.\n\nJuan Pablo was dealt quite an unexpected blow, when two of his favorite ladies decided he wasn't for them, instead of the other way around.\n\nThe rejections have fueled intense speculation that Juan Pablo will probably not propose to either one of tonight's finalists.\n\nWhile it isn't at all clear who Juan Pablo is leaning towards, it's pretty certain that the ladies from the show don't want to see cruel Claire Crawley win.\n\nA show insider tells Star that Crawley worked hard at making sure she alienated every single woman and the show:\n\n\"From dominating Juan Pablo's time, even during group dates, to unfairly sneaking away for an unscheduled midnight swim with him in the ocean, Claire clearly was the gal that the other women loved to hate this season.\n\n\"She tried to play innocent afterwards but it didn't wash.\"\n\nNot surprisingly this isn't the first time that Ms. Crawley has got on the bad side of a lady by acting sketchy around a man.\n\nBack in August of 1999 Claire had to turn to Sacramento County according to Star to protect her against a group of women that were looking to settle a few scores.\n\nIn the order of protection filed by Claire, she alleges that ladies called her \"a f***ing sl*t\" a well as threating her physical person:\n\n\"Claire claimed that Jennifer, sometimes accompanied by a group of friend, has 'threatened to physically harm me', and had stated she would 'hunt me down and beat the s**t out of me.\"\n\nOne can only surmise since Claire hasn't learned her lesson, Jennifer never was able to catch up with her.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Classical Art, All rights reserved.

RealitySteve Bachelor 2014 spoilers claim that Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo are still together, they are still dating 2014, but that they do not get engaged in the finale episode tonight on ABC. The question is whether Juan Pablo will propose to Nikki on After the Final Rose.\n\nNikki and Juan Pablo were together, and dating, right after tonight\u2019s episode was filmed. But there might not be anything more to that. RealitySteve tells viewers that false tabloid reports have been heating up this month. RealitySteve suggests in his spoilers that are not any real surprises tonight. The episode was filmed without much drama. Juan Pablo didn\u2019t choose Clare. And while Nikki was expecting a ring, she does not get one. \u201cThe overnight date portion of this season took place at or near Sugar Beach, which was where the rose ceremony was. Then for the final rose ceremony which took place Tuesday, November 12th, I originally reported it was going to be at The Landings resort.\u201d RealitySteve adds \u201cThat was mistaken. The final rose ceremony took place at or near the Cap Maison Hotel. Both Clare and Nikki showed up, he didn\u2019t send one home early or anything like that. And in the end.

He asserts that Juan Pablo allegedly never wanted to propose to any of the women in this case. \u201cHowever, for Juan Pablo, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more about him never wanting to propose to any of these girls in the first place before he even started this journey.\u201d\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nBut the vacuum of confusion remains on the future of Nikki and Juan Pablo.

The buzz on Twitter is that he\u2019s the \"worst 'Bachelor' ever.\" The women on the show didn\u2019t like him. Even the show\u2019s producers are totally over him.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Related: Juan Pablo Has Some Not-So-Nice Thoughts About a Gay 'Bachelor']\n\n\"Everyone is definitely ready for Juan Pablo's season to be over. Producers felt like they were putting out fires left and right with him, starting with the gay comments,\" an inside source told Yahoo TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He used the 'second language' excuse a lot, no one is really buying it. Two girls chose to leave in the top six. When has that ever happened before? That should be indicative of what we were working with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[Related: 'The Bachelor': Was That the Awkwardest Kiss Ever?!]\n\nHow far Juan Pablo has fallen! When he was chosen to be the \"Bachelor\" in August after vying for Desiree Hartsock\u2019s heart on \"The Bachelorette,\" his adoring public couldn\u2019t stop gushing over his abs, his sexy accent, and his tender love for his daughter. At the \"Men Tell All\" taping, female audience members screamed \"JUAN PABLO\" so loudly, they could practically be heard in the next state.\n\n\n\nFast forward half a year, and he's generating comments like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo is honestly the worst bachelor they have ever chosen; he has noo personality, he's rude, & he has bad taste In girls #sendHIMhome \u2014 Abby Martinson (@abbymmsugar013) February 26, 2014\n\nLet me speak for every woman in the United States, Juan Pablo is the absolute worst bachelor. \u2014 Regan Brickman (@ReganBrickman) February 26, 2014\n\nSpoiler alert, Juan Pablo falls in love with himself.

Juan Pablo is really the worst. \u2014 Gillian Smith (@gillyheartsyou) March 4, 2014\n\nIt all began early in the season, when Juan Pablo made remarks against having a gay \"Bachelor.\" He apologized for the derogatory comments, but they ignited a controversy that the show still hasn\u2019t escaped.\n\n\n\nThen he displayed hypocritical behavior \u2014 sometimes he would hold off on kissing women out of \"respect\" for his young daughter, Camila, while other times he would make out with one contestant in front of the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Related: A 'Bachelor' Finalist Leaves After Disaster Fantasy Suite Date]\n\nThe most egregious example was when he \"slut-shamed\" finalist Clare, who asked him to join her for a late-night swim in the ocean. The next day, he essentially blamed her for putting him in a situation that was \"disrespectful\" to his daughter.\n\n\n\nAnd, as our source noted, two of the top six women left early by their choice. Andi Dorfman departed after a \"disaster\" fantasy suite date. She accused Juan Pablo of being self-absorbed and never asking her questions about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent \"Women Tell All\" episode confirmed that hardly anybody seems to consider Juan Pablo a good catch. They eviscerated him for using the \"language barrier\" and his daughter as excuses for his conflicting, hurtful behavior.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether to congratulate or feel bad for whichever of the final two women, Nikki or Clare, wins... if you can even call it winning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Bachelor\" finale airs Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. on ABC.", "235": "Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis will bestow his final rose to one of the two remaining contestants on ABC's \"The Bachelor\" tonight. While I'm guilty of getting sucked into the reality show, some weeks (especially this season) the show's biggest draw is the excuse it provides to invite friends over and mix a few cocktails while watching. That inspired me to find some rose-themed cocktails for tonight's season finale.\n\nRose syrup is a extra-sweet variation on simple syrup that's infused with rose petals. It can add a mild floral taste and light pink hue to a drink, depending on how much you use. It's also quite easy to make at home \u2013 just boil sugar and water, then simmer lightly with rose petals and let it infuse for a couple hours.\n\nYou can use rose syrup as a sweetener in myriad cocktails. In fact, it adds a nice touch to even standard recipes like margaritas (see my version below). That's the beauty of infused simple syrups \u2013 they're an easy way to add a fresh touch to otherwise familiar drinks.\n\nBelow are three rose syrup cocktails perfect for sipping while seeing who Juan Pablo picks \u2013 or on any other occasion, for that matter.", "236": "Tonight, on ABC\u2019s The Bachelor, either Clare Crawley (a 32-year-old hairstylist) or Nikki Ferrell (her 26-year-old pediatric nurse adversary) will accept a final rose from Juan Pablo Galavis. Both women are blonde, petite, eager to please, and \u201cready for real love\u201d; both have spent ten weeks enduring tears, group dates, and countless bikini-clad make-outs on international beaches in order to reach this moment.\n\nBut \u2014 regardless of whom Juan Pablo selects as rose recipient and future bride \u2014 neither will actually win, and that\u2019s because Juan Pablo is the worst. The only winners here are viewers: It turns out having a terrible bachelor makes The Bachelor much more interesting.\n\nThroughout The Bachelor\u2019s 18 seasons, the contestants have tended to be objectionable only in their homogeny: Typically the men are low-budget Disney princes \u2014 all doofy, affable, white bros with square jaws, whose top interests include making out and not wearing shirts. This season, ABC selected a \u201cfan favorite\u201d from season nine of The Bachelorette. Juan Pablo is a 32-year-old American-born Venezuelan former professional soccer player with a faux-hawk, a six-pack, an accent, and a young daughter. He\u2019s the show\u2019s first single father and first \u201cminority.\u201d\n\nHe also turned out to be a PR disaster. First he raised eyebrows after he declared that there should not be a gay Bachelor, using the word \u201cpervert\u201d in his explanation. Then, he slut-shamed a contestant (the finalist Clare) after their illicit on-camera sexual encounter. Most recently, he mocked the mentally disabled in a tweet. (\u201c\u2019Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy!\u201d) For these offenses, he\u2019s been vilified on social media and celebrity-news outlets. ABC had to release a statement apologizing for his \u201ccareless, thoughtless and insensitive\u201d comments, and he\u2019s already lost his post-Bachelor gig on Dancing With the Stars.\n\nYet Juan Pablo\u2019s unpleasantness goes beyond those obvious debacles. On the show, he\u2019s creepy, manipulative, inattentive, and disingenuous; once, he took a woman on a date to some kind of EDM rave. He speaks to grown women with the same cadence he probably uses with his kindergarten-age daughter. He barely asks the women questions about themselves, and if they display any genuine emotion or bring up \u201crelationship issues,\u201d he turns into a vacant, blinky toddler. He responds to such overtures with a patronizing \u201cokay, okay\u201d or perhaps \u201cyou\u2019ve been doing some thinking,\u201d then proceeds to initiate a make-out.\n\nAnd while The Bach has always involved a strong undercurrent of Madonna-whore complex, Juan Pablo has made it more apparent than ever before. On group dates he\u2019ll dry-hump one woman in a hot tub while the others look on, then turn around and tell other women he won\u2019t kiss them because he has a daughter and must be careful. Fatherhood \u2014 the very thing that must have made him look like an appealingly domestic Bachelor candidate \u2014 has actually made him seem even more despicable, since his child is most often treated as currency to help him get what he wants out of women.\n\nAfter the slut-shaming incident, Willa Paskin, writing for Slate, declared that the episode exposed the show\u2019s weird attitudes toward sex. She wrote: \u201cThe Bachelor continues to present itself as romantic, out to find a good man a life partner, a soul mate, a true love \u2014 all while behaving like a pimp.\u201d As Paskin points out, Juan Pablo\u2019s antics have made the show\u2019s strangeness fascinatingly apparent.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, though, it\u2019s given the show\u2019s women the chance to reveal themselves in ways the women of previous seasons have not. The franchise has consistently portrayed women as googly-eyed idiots willing to swallow bland bromides while tearing each other down. This season, the women (and the viewers) are calling bullshit, and it\u2019s miraculous. As a result, we\u2019re finally seeing defiant, distinct personalities, not just the 21-year-old pharmaceutical sales reps who don\u2019t know any better than to get caught up in a highly choreographed, department-of-tourism-friendly, margarita-drenched fairytale . Everyone knows what early-date infatuation looks like, but what about disillusionment? Or indignation? Or righteous refusal to put up with a total buffoon?\n\nTake, for example, Sharleen Joynt, a 29-year-old opera singer from Germany who was sophisticated, sexually experienced, and relatable. When she chose to leave the show of her own volition, she commented on why she and Juan Pablo hadn\u2019t forged a connection: \u201cI wish I was more dumb,\u201d she said in her farewell monologue.\n\nAnother contestant, Andi Dorfman, preemptively dumped Juan Pablo: She couldn\u2019t abide his general shallowness after their overnight date in Saint Lucia. For the uninitiated, an overnight date includes an invitation to the Fantasy Suite \u2014 where the final contestants get the chance to spend a one-on-one night in a hotel room with the bachelor and without cameras, for a night of \u201cwhatever.\u201d Historically, the contestant will walk out the next day glowing with post-coital bliss, jabbering on about having the best night of their life and how they have never felt more complete or connected or certain that this man (who is scheduled to hump two more women in succession in that same suite) is THE ONE.\n\nDorfman, a feisty 26-year-old assistant D.A. from Atlanta, emerged from the suite with a forced smile, a chilly peck, and declared it \u201cthe worst date she had ever been on.\u201d She added that Juan Pablo had spent a considerable amount of time bragging about his previous night with Clare. Subsequently, after Dorfman was informed that she had \u201cbarely made it to the final round,\u201d she told JP he was an asshole and left the show. Twitter erupted in support.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Joynt and Dorfman, though: It was all of this season\u2019s women. The \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d episode is normally framed as a chance for jilted lovers to air their drama and feuds with each other. But last week\u2019s episode marked the first time in the history of the show that the women were more like a support group, with the man as a recipient of seething hatred. (In part, this was probably a way for the producers to address the anti\u2013Juan Pablo sentiment on social media.) Among their complaints: that it was \u201cobvious he didn\u2019t care about me,\u201d that he played blatant favorites, that he neglected some women and was, in general, a selfish prick. With a common enemy, the contestants were unified: \u201cWe came here for a husband; he came here to find a girlfriend,\u201d one contestant said. And, in an unexpected twist, the women even began defending each other, e.g., collectively reassuring single mother Renee that Juan Pablo respected her. They formed a weird sisterhood of those who had survived a brief encounter with Juan Pablo.\n\nIt almost made you feel bad for the guy, who sat sweating, blinking vacantly, unable to really defend himself without looking like an even bigger jerk. Almost. Because finally, after 27 seasons of the artifice, sunsets, and evening gowns, viewers got to see what actually happens when The Bachelor is vulnerable and exposed \u2014 it wasn\u2019t pretty, but it sure made for good television.", "237": "Tonight\u2019s finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d will finally conclude the sad chronicle of Juan Pablo on season 18 of ABC\u2019s hugely popular series. Even though we haven\u2019t yet watched the final rose ceremony, multiple spoilers reports claim that this season\u2019s front runner did not end up winning Juan Pablo\u2019s heart, instead Nikki Ferrell home the final rose. So why after several one on one dates, steamy make outs and, of course, their infamous moonlight ocean dip did Juan Pablo not choose Clare Crawley as the season 18 winner? Well because there are many more factors at play involved in choosing the final lady then just the amount of time JP and Clare spent together.\n\nThe main reason as to why Clare will not win Juan Pablo\u2019s heart is mainly because Clare was too smart for her good, and unfortunately treated the dating competition as just that\u2014 a competition. Clare knew exactly how to get Juan Pablo\u2019s attention, not because he was actively seeking her out, but more due to the fact that Clare knew how to put himself on his radar at every opportunity. Some simple examples of Clare\u2019s tactics include her refusal to eat the octopus and then only tasting it \u201cfor him,\u201d or the more well known and controversial ocean swim that led to Clare and Juan Pablo engaging in the earliest intimate night in the history of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Even though Clare was on the receiving end of most of Juan Pablo\u2019s attention, she never really got to know him instead continually one-upped her fellow contestants.\n\nEven when they attempted to further their relationship, it was all based on psychical attraction rather than an emotional connection. Like Sharleen who notably eliminated herself from season 18, Juan Pablo and Clare have a serious magnetism to each other but it seems like that wasn\u2019t enough for JP to choose to spend the rest of his life with her. More over the most important piece of evidence indicating that Nikki will receive JP\u2019s final rose instead of Clare, is Camila. Juan Pablo introduced his young daughter to Nikki in Miami, and that is most likely the most important clue into telling us whom JP truly cares for.", "238": "\n\nLOS ANGELES (LALATE) \u2013 Who win the Bachelor 2014? Last fall, RealitySteve\u2019s Bachelor 2014 spoilers announced who Juan Pablo picks. Final results for The Bachelor tonight March 10, 2014 reveal if the Bachelor 2014 winner is in fact just as RealitySteve predicted, and if Juan Pablo makes his pick consistent with months of RealitySteve spoilers.\n\nTonight the mystery over who wins the Bachelor 2014 is resolved. And if Reality Steve\u2019s spoilers are correct, tonight ABC viewers will watch the Bachelor 2014 name Nikki Ferrell as your winner. The question remains, however, what happens thereafter. Details about why Juan Pablo picks Nikki, how he picks Nikki, and more important, what happened to Juan Pablo and Nikki after filming ended, remain uncertain.\n\nRealitySteve tells news today 3/10/14 that viewers should ignore tabloid reports about Juan Pablo. Does Juan Pablo live with his parents, is Juan Pablo broke, and does Juan Pablo deliver an engagement to Nikki in the finale tonight? For several seasons, tabloids have historically delivered fake spoilers in advance of the finale. These \u201cfaux spoilers\u201d, as LALATE called them last year, involve tabloids telling readers that they have juicy spoilers about the season finale, when in fact the tabloids know that the spoilers are actually untrue.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 4\n\nSteve says Juan Pablo picks Nikki, Juan Pablo does not propose to Nikki, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still not engaged, but that they are still together. However, RealitySteve has been telling readers allot lately that \u201cit means nothing.\u201d But has not yet clarified what he means. For example, on Monday he tweeted \u201cAs four tonight spoiler, nothing has changed since St. Lucia. Ignore the tabloid reports. Juan Pablo. & Nikki still together, even though it means nothing.\u201d\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nBut could RealitySteve be wrong? He has been wrong before. Last season on the Bachelorette, it appeared in the penultimate episode that RealitySteve\u2019s spoilers were going to be wrong. Reaction heated Twitter the night of that episode. But RealitySteve defended his predictions. In the end, his Bachelorette spoilers were wrong. And yet, Steve has never truly told viewers how, where and why those spoilers turned out to be wrong, very wrong.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 9\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 10\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 11\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 12\n\nAlong with tonight\u2019s episode have come other predictions about the finale\u2019s editing. \u201cABC is gonna have to do one h\u2013ll of a spin/editing job this season. First, knowing that the spoilers are out there, they\u2019ll edit the show to throw people off in any way they can\u201d, Steve told news. But that has not exactly happened.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nSteve adds that \u201cAnd secondly, to convince America this guy is sincere \u2026 let\u2019s just say the light isn\u2019t even on upstairs and nobody\u2019s home.\u201d Steve did correctly predict backlash about Juan Pablo this season. So far Juan Pablo has appeared on several magazine covers being called the worse Bachelor ever. That type of reaction was predicted by RealitySteve last winter. \u201cBut this notion that this is the best Bachelor they\u2019ve ever had and what a great season it\u2019s going to be is all propaganda.

While it was known to the general public that Juan Pablo was no Sean Lowe, aka sweet, smart and oh so marketable, E! News just revealed that there would be no future partnership between ABC and Juan Pablo. The celebrity news outlet claims that the show\u2019s producers, who were first thrilled with the idea of the first Latino bachelor, are know counting down the moments until season 18 comes to a close. Juan Pablo will of course have his fair share of late night talk show appearances, but a source told E!

Many news outlets are speculating that on tonight\u2019s finale episode, JP does not propose to Nikki, but he does at least give her the final rose, so despite the lack of engagement, there is some sort of a commitment between the pair.

There was his \"swim in the ocean\" in Vietnam with Clare and subsequent shaming of her about it, the voluntary departures of Sharleen and Andi and the latter's revelations about what kind of a guy Juan Pablo really is (according to her: self-absorbed, negative and prone to dismissing others' feelings with an \"It's OK\").

Whom will he choose? Will the two women, sworn enemies, utter a single word to each other? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s certainly been a crazy season. Here are our favorite moments from this season of El Bachelor:\n\nBaby bump alert!\n\nWhen Clare arrived at the opening-night ceremony wearing a prosthetic baby bump. Gentlemen, when a woman shows up for a first date pretending to be pregnant, you can\u2019t say you haven\u2019t been warned about any manner of crazy that ensues. Points awarded to Clare for truly bizarre humor, though.\n\nMeet Lucy: the \u201cfree spirit\u201d\n\nContestant Lucy \u2014 whose occupation was listed as \u201cFree Spirit\u201d \u2014 and her inability to keep her clothes on. Whether she was happily strolling down the street nude to promote animal adoption or flashing everyone in the pool, Kate Upton BFF Lucy Aragon seemed far more interested in having fun than in pursuing any great love connection with blond, bland Juan Pablo. For this, Free Spirit Lucy, we salute you.\n\nThe Vietnamese Beach Incident (a.k.a. Juan Pablo slut-shames Clare)\n\nGetting caught up in the spontaneity of a moment, Clare knocked on JP\u2019s door and invited him for a midnight swim; he happily accepted, and there was a wild makeout session in the water. We didn\u2019t hear any complaints until the following day, when JP announced that the hookup had been a mistake \u2014 he has a 4-year-old daughter, after all. Clare was ashamed; tears flowed, and \u201cI have a 4-year-old daughter\u201d was firmly established as JP\u2019s favorite convenient excuse (followed closely by \u201cEnglish is my second language\u201d).\n\nAndi\u2019s dad\n\nHy Dorfman became the toast of Bachelor Nation during the show\u2019s \u201cHometown Visits\u201d episode, wherein Juan Pablo visited four contestants and their respective families. When asked if he would give his blessing to Juan Pablo and Andi, Hy turned the question on Juan Pablo, asking him how he would feel if his own daughter came to him with a man who was dating several other women. \u201cIf I seemed over-protective on the show, it is because I am protecting the most spectacular, special, amazing daughter in the world,\u201d Hy tweeted after the show. The best part? If Andi Dorfman becomes the next Bachelorette, as has been widely speculated, we\u2019ll get to see more of Hy.\n\nChris Harrison\u2019s barely concealed disdain for Juan Pablo\n\nThe host\u2019s normally jovial demeanor has been cool this season; it\u2019s clear from his flinty-eyed glances that he thinks Juan Pablo is a huge tool. In that estimation, he is far from alone; the hashtag \u201cWorstBachelorEver\u201d had plenty of entries on Twitter, and E! News published a recent story saying that Juan Pablo would not be cast on season 18 of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d (he was reportedly seriously being considered at one point). It didn\u2019t help when Juan Pablo said a gay \u201cBachelor\u201d doesn\u2019t belong on TV because gays are \u201cmore \u2018pervert\u2019 in a sense.\u201d He blamed it on the language barrier. Nice try.\n\nSharleen says bye-bye to \u2018The Bachelor\u2019\n\nProfessional opera singer Sharleen Joynt was a breath of fresh air on the show, a gorgeous, smart woman who, while physically attracted to Juan Pablo, felt she was missing that \u201ccerebral connection\u201d she needed. \u201cI wish I was a little dumber,\u201d she said, frustrated with her tendency to \u201coverthink\u201d situations (not a problem shared by Juan Pablo). She mystified many of the other women, who seemed truly baffled that Juan Pablo was intrigued by the brunette. (Ladies, a hint: It could have had something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t falling over herself to date him.) Sharleen eventually left of her own accord, a refreshing change from the usual tearful rose ceremony rejection with the guy calling all the shots.\n\nAndi dumps Juan Pablo and \u2018es okay\u2019\n\nFellow gorgeous smart woman Andi was another contestant to feel that Juan Pablo\u2019s charms were only surface level; after a night in the Fantasy Suite that was anything but fantastic, she elected to leave as well. Juan Pablo\u2019s response to this breakup? \u201cEs okay,\u201d he said, shrugging. And then, several more times throughout the farewell conversation: \u201cEs okay.\u201d We hope he\u2019s looked into copyrighting this phrase; while \u201cDWTS\u201d doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to pan out, there are always T-shirts and coffee mugs to be sold.", "247": "Poor Juan Pablo. Season 18 has been a rough one on him. He may be one of the better looking bachelors, but he\u2019s definitely one of the least liked \u2014 which means this season of \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 was one of the most explosive ever.\n\nDuring Juan Pablo\u2018s search for love, he encountered many (and we mean many) hilarious OMG moments. Somehow, we cut down the tons of crazy Bachelor moments down to six \u2014 and with the finale taking place March 10, we\u2019re reminding you of the best, worst, and just all-around awkward moments on season 18. Click through our gallery to relive each and every one.\n\n\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Craziest Moments\n\nWhile I\u2019ll let you click through the gallery of the best moments, I have to run down some of most shocking moments of the season that I still can\u2019t believe even happened. [hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25661214\u2033]\n\nThe best moment of the entire season was when Andi Dorfman told JuanPabs exactly what he needed to hear \u2014 it\u2019s not ok to only talk about yourself on every single date, it\u2019s not okay to just kiss when you\u2019re not talking about yourself, it\u2019s not okay to bring up your overnight date with Clare on your overnight date with Andi, and it\u2019s not ok to to tell someone they \u201cbarely\u201d made it this far. Oh, and most importantly, it\u2019s not ok to say \u201cees ok\u201d after every statement. Then she tells him she\u2019s over it. Even at the Women Tell All special, she said that she pretended to be asleep that night so the overnight date would be over. Ouch!\n\nHowever, Andi wasn\u2019t the first to leave voluntarily. Sharleen was a favorite of JP\u2019s all along, but since day one, she wasn\u2019t sure she was totally into it. While their sexual chemistry was apparently really good (and the kissing was really bad to watch) , she pretty much told Juan Pablo she couldn\u2019t see him as the Juan for her. She also told the cameras continually that pretty much, she was too smart for him. She actually said at one point, \u201cI wish I was dumber.\u201d\n\nThey definitely had a connection, as did Juan Pablo and Andi \u2014 but both the girls (in my opinion) took the right route and got out of there!\n\nNikki Rocks \u201970s Cowgirl Look\n\nOne more moment I\u2019ve got to mention is that outfit that Nikki Ferrell rocked before she spent the night with Juan Pablo. They went horse back riding, so she wore pants, and they swam in the ocean, so she paired the pants with a bikini top \u2014 sounds ok? Well, we have to mention that the pants looked like a uniform from Woodstock, as they were wide-leg and floral print, and the bikini top had tassels all over it . . . Maybe she was going for \u201970s cowgirl? The only thing more uncomfortable was that Juan Pablo told her if she wanted to just wear a thong, he\u2019d be fine with that. Ugh!\n\nHollywoodLifers \u2014 click through the gallery of all the craziest moments on this season of the Bachelor, and then let us know which was the most shocking! Do you plan on watching the finale?\n\n\u2014 Emily Longeretta\n\nFollow @EmilyLongeretta\n\nMore \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Coverage:", "248": "Season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is coming to a close on ABC on March 10, and needless to say the 2014 season has been a complete mess. Rumor has it that the producers and crew members have dubbed Juan Pablo \u201cthe worst bachelor ever,\u201d and in honor of that, we\u2019re looking back at his seven most controversial moments this season:\n\n1. Not Kissing Lauren \u2026 And Then Kissing Clare\n\nJuan Pablo started off the season by making and breaking some rules. In episode 4, Lauren tried to kiss the bachelor but was immediately shot down. Juan Pablo tried to console her, but Lauren ended up in tears.\n\n\u201cI know that you\u2019ve kissed other girls,\u201d she told him. But all Juan Pablo would tell her is that it\u2019s not an easy situation. He proceeded to tell the cameras that he\u2019s not on the show to kiss everybody \u2026 but then went on to kiss Clare shortly after.\n\n\u201cI know I said I\u2019m not going to kiss anybody,\u201d Juan Pablo explained to the cameras. \u201cBut she\u2019s sexy. She\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\n2. Juan Pablo\u2019s Anti-Gay Remarks\n\nWhile doing an interview to promote his season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d Juan Pablo made an extremely controversial comment about the possibility of a future gay bachelor. The 32-year-old reportedly told The TV Page\u2019s Sean Daly: \u201cI respect [gay people], but, honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good example for kids.\u201d \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star continued that he finds gay people to be \u201cmore \u2018pervert\u2019 in a sense,\u201d and that the show would be \u201ctoo hard to watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cBachelor\u201d host Chris Harrison later told the Hollywood Reporter that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Juan Pablo\u2019s comments and that they don\u2019t reflect his feelings or thoughts on the subject. Juan Pablo ended up being confronted by rejected bachelorette Kelly during the \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d special, and told her that they would discuss it after the show.\n\n3. Clare\u2019s Ocean Drama\n\nFrom the start of the season, Juan Pablo shared a steamy connection with Clare \u2013 and things escalated between the pair in episode 5. After a group date in Vietnam ended up with the two in his private pool, Clare decided to pay the single dad a visit in his hotel room \u2026 at 4 a.m. Asking him to jump in the ocean with her, Juan Pablo stripped off his shirt in a blink of an eye and ran after the 32-year-old California native. Clare told the cameras that the two \u201cjust went for it\u201d and that it was \u201cpure bliss \u2026 in every way.\u201d But Juan Pablo didn\u2019t feel the same way.\n\nThe next day he pulled her aside and told her that he made a mistake. However Clare stood by her actions, telling the cameras that \u201cthere was no misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n4. Sending Cassandra Home On Her Birthday\n\nJuan Pablo made a promise to single moms Cassandra and Renee that he would let them know immediately if he didn\u2019t feel a connection with them so that way they wouldn\u2019t be separated any longer from their children. And he did just that with Cassandra \u2026 on her 22nd birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard for me because you\u2019re so gorgeous, you\u2019re funny, you\u2019re so nice \u2026 I wish we were in the same chapter.\u201d\n\nIt may not have been \u201ccontroversial\u201d that he dumped her on her birthday, but \u201cBachelor\u201d fans did find it cruel.\n\n5. Sending Renee Home After Meeting Her Son In Hometown Dates\n\nAll season long Juan Pablo has called Renee and Cassandra his \u201cspecial ones\u201d because they are single moms. However after deciding to go on a Hometown date with Renee and meeting her son, he ended up dumping the 32-year-old. The move seemed hypocritical after he insisted throughout the season that he moved slow with her and was respectful of kissing her because he had her 8-year-old son, Ben, in mind. His decision to dump her after meeting Ben became even more controversial when he revealed a story about how Ben had been devastated over his mom\u2019s last breakup.\n\n6. The Fantasy Suite \u2018Nightmare\u2019 With Andi\n\nAndi made it into the top 3, but when time came for her and Juan Pablo to spend some time away from the cameras in the fantasy suite things began to fall apart. While Andi stayed the night in the suite, in the morning she told the cameras that she couldn\u2019t leave fast enough. According to the 26-year-old assistant district attorney, Juan Pablo spent the night \u201cname dropping\u201d and talking about his overnight date with Clare. She continued to tell the cameras that their evening was \u201cunbelievable\u201d and inappropriate\u201d due to his inability to filter. \u201cHe thinks that he could say whatever he wants to say,\u201d Andi explained, saying that it\u2019s \u201cjust offensive.\u201d\n\n7. The \u2018Default\u2019 Dilemma\n\nAndi chose to have a heart-to-heart with Juan Pablo about her decision to leave, and things proceeded to blow up. Juan Pablo told her everything was \u201cOK\u201d and that he respected her decision, but that wasn\u2019t what Andi wanted to hear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not OK,\u201d she fired back at him. \u201cI put myself out there \u2026 it bothers me when you say it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe bachelorette then brought up the fact that Juan Pablo allegedly told her that she made it into the top 3 by \u201cdefault.\u201d However Juan Pablo told her that he didn\u2019t say \u201cdefault\u201d because it\u2019s not in his vocabulary \u2026 instead he told her that he may have said \u201cyou barely made it here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe put words in my mouth by saying that I used the word \u2018default,\u2019\u201d Juan Pablo later wrote in his blog for People. \u201cIt was because of her comments in Atlanta about wanting badly to fall in love that I almost decided to bring Renee instead of her, but I followed my heart and feelings instead.\u201d\n\nThe season finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d airs on March 10 on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT.

Finally TODAY the soap opera comes to an END...\" Galavis tweeted on Monday.\n\nGalavis, a 32-year-old U.S.-born Venezuelan former soccer pro, has also stirred drama off-screen and is being touted as one of the most controversial \"Bachelor\" stars. Earlier this year, he was slammed over anti-gay comments, for which he later apologized, and recently drew fire over a retweet of an insensitive tweet mentioning a word meaning \"mentally disabled.\" He said on Twitter last week: \"He In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.\"\n\nCheck out 5 facts to know about tonight's three-hour LIVE \"Bachelor\" finale television event, which includes a two-hour finale and the subsequent special, \"After The Final Rose.\" The drama begins on ABC on Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n1. Who are the two finalists?\n\nContestant Andi exited the show on the last episode, during which she criticized Galavis' behavior, and also said on the \"Bachelor\" special \"Women Tell All\" that he was \"borderline narcissistic.\" The remaining two contestants are:\n\n\n\nClare (pictured left), a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, California\n\nNikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n2. What can we expect to see on \"The Bachelor\" finale?\n\nDuring the two-hour finale, which airs between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET, the two women will meet Galavis' family -- awkward! ABC is also promising a \"shocking outcome.\"\n\n3. Will the finale end with a proposal?\n\nThat's always the question. Galavis had told OTRC.com in January that in retrospect, he would not have agreed to star on the series. (Check out our exclusive interview with Juan Pablo Galavis).\n\n4. Special guests!\n\nPast stars of \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\" will be shown watching the three-hour season 18 finale event with a studio audience.

The reality TV star also visited a chapel two nights before the show\u2019s finale is set to air.\n\nPhoto credit: Juan Pablo Galavis/Twitter\n\nFar short of controversial comments, Juan Pablo Galavis hit Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch a boxing match just two nights before the The Bachelor finale airs. The opinionated single father apparently also visited a wedding chapel as a possible hint to how the hit dating show might end.\n\nGalavis decided to document his whole trip on Twitter. Mainly there to watch fellow countryman Jorge Linares of Venezuela take on Nihito Arakawa in a boxing match, Galavis also jokingly took a photo of the MGM wedding chapel.\n\nIn the photo, Galavis stands in front of the chapel smiling and pointing to the entrance, seemingly teasing fans with what might be a hint to how the show ends in the final episode.\n\nGalavis traveled with two pals who accompanied him to the fight and later to a dinner with 10 members of Linares\u2019 boxing team. The group ate at Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, staying at the eatery for more than two hours.\n\n\u201cIt was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter\u2019s team and a couple of older ladies with big hair,\u201d a source for People magazine said.\n\nCONGRATS to my BRO @JorgeLinares for that WIN tonight\u2026 pic.twitter.com/LovIklVxXl \u2014 Juan Pablo Galavis\u2122 (@JuanPaGalavis) March 9, 2014\n\n\n\nAfter the meal, Galavis and his two friends went to Beacher\u2019s Madhouse nightclub for a short visit. The 32-year-old The Bachelor star didn\u2019t drink anything, but he posed for photos with fans for about 30 minutes. Then the three friends took a stroll around the MGM Grand\u2019s casino where Galavis posed for more photos with anyone who would request it.\n\nAfter several recent controversial comments, Galavis has become a polarizing figure among The Bachelor fans. Some call him the worst Bachelor ever while others think he\u2019s just honest and possibly misunderstood because of his Spanish language barrier.\n\nAfter an eventful season, Galavis will choose between his two finalists, Clare and Nikki, on Monday night, and will most likely propose to one of them, given that it all goes well. However, as with many seasons before this one, several rumors have claimed that the current Bachelor does not propose to anyone at the end of the show.", "251": "The much-anticipated Season 18 finale of The Bachelor has been touted as the Most Dramatic Finale Ever, which brings up the question: Exactly how juicy would it have to be in order to top all the previous 17 finales? While Juan Pablo, Nikki, and Clare (and Andi) have created plenty of gossip to keep America occupied and guessing at how their quest for love will end, let\u2019s not forget the many men and women who have walked down this road before.\n\nAnd if their experiences are any indication, there will most likely be a proposal\u2026 but a wedding? Improbable.\n\nWhen the first season of The Bachelor aired in 2002, the dating game show ended with bachelor Alex Michel making a difficult decision in choosing between the final two contestants. While episode previews showed him picking out Harry Winston rings, he didn\u2019t actually propose.\n\nSince then, however, there\u2019s been a steady trend of proposals in recent years, with more than half of the seasons ending in proposals thus far.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In fact, only one of the final rose ceremony proposals resulted in a wedding, and that didn\u2019t happen until season 17 with Sean and Catherine. (Jason and Molly from season 13 got married as well, but he actually proposed to someone else on the show.)\n\nWatch the video above to see how it ended for some of the most notable couples from previous seasons of The Bachelor.

The evidence is a recently released deleted scene from season 18 of ABC\u2019s hugely popular dating series, and the two subjects in the scene are none other than Juan Pablo and Clare, and like the rest of this couple\u2019s alone time the moment captured on film is tender and romantic.\n\nThe competition has come down to just two women, Clare and Nikki, and tonight\u2019s finale episode will have Juan Pablo choosing one of them to marry while the other one just sent home with just her bags in tow. But way back before the competition was narrowed down so severely Juan Pablo and Clare made waves in the literal waves by becoming the first \u201cBachelor\u201d couple to how should we say this, take a \u201cdip in the ocean\u201d so early on in the competition. They were immediately attracted to each other from the gecko with the pair enjoying the first intimate one-on-one date for the season. During the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik. Like many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik\u2019s \u201cNo Better Lovers\u201d their song. Before listening to it in the tender moment that was deleted from the season, they have danced to it before during another one-on-one date.\n\nJuan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry. The pair does begin their signature make out, with a bit of candid lip-syncing in between, before Clare announcing, \u201cWe should just play it when we get married.\u201d While Juan Pablo does not immediately respond to her request for the wedding song, he does belt out a cute \u201cbaby\u201d right in tune with the song, so we are assuming he agrees.\n\nObviously we are basing our assumption of who Juan Pablo picks off of spoilers, and while the king of TV spoilers Reality Steve claims that JP ends up picking Nikki Ferrell in the final rose ceremony, this exclusive video is making us second guess. JP and Clare had an immediate connection, and the pair are obviously attracted to each other physically, what we thought was lacking was their emotional connection. However, after watching them relaxing together and then JP produce a romantic surprise for Clare, we are thinking that these two are more in love than we first assumed. Clare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.", "254": "The end of everything has to come eventually and tonight marks The Bachelor 2014 Finale and the end of us seeing The Bachelor Juan Pablo shirtless every week talking about his love of his daughter and himself, but the big question of the night is who gets the final rose from Juan Pablo tonight on The Bachelor Season 18 Finale? The Bachelor 2014 spoilers might have me believe that it is Nikki Ferrell that he proposes to, but I may believe somewhere in that crazy brain in my head that Clare Crawley still has a shot at taking home that diamond ring!\n\nTo me, this is a toss-up and not because I think both of the women are good for Juan Pablo, but because I think this whole season is a joke. You could see that last week on The Bachelor 2014 Women Tell All special and the women ganging up to attack Juan Pablo and not attack each other! They said it (and I agree with them), but they don\u2019t think Juan Pablo was genuine in his search for a wife and stepmother to his daughter Camila.\n\nSo, whoever does win The Bachelor 2014 tonight, do we think they will still be together a month from now, if they are ever still together today?

The two 16-year-olds, classmates of the victim, have been charged with homicide.\n\nCNN reported that police first became interested when they checked out a suspicious, unoccupied vehicle backed up to the treeline, according to a department statement. Officers went into the woods, and spotted two suspects running from the area.\n\nPolice then returned to the car, and the 16-year-olds walked up and answered the question that set off immediate suspicion among the officers.\n\nGet more details on this chilling crime and check out a video in the case here.\n\nDaughter, 13, allegedly lured mom into garage so boy, 15, could cut her throat: Should they be charged as adults?\n\nThere is so much more to this story than the few facts being reported as this hour \u2013 like what is going on with these two teens caught up in an alleged plot to kill the young girl\u2019s mother. But even the scarce details are shocking.\n\nIt comes out of Ocala, Florida, where police say a 13-year-old girl allegedly lured her mom into the family garage, where a boy, 15, allegedly waited to cut the mom\u2019s throat. All this, according to CNN.\n\nThe Marion County Sheriff's Office said the boy slit the woman\u2019s throat, then the husband, and father of the girl, heard commotion and went to check on the garage.\n\nThe boy allegedly put a knife to the dad\u2019s throat, as well.

That is yet to be determined, but we do have a sneak peek of The Bachelor 2014 finale for you to check out in our The Bachelor 2014 spoilers video below!\n\nLast week on The Bachelor Season 18, we took a week off from all the action during the taping of the season and had the Women Tell All special. The eliminated women on The Bachelor 2014 took to the stage to sit down with Bachelor host Chris Harrison to dish on things we didn\u2019t see. What didn\u2019t we see? Well, it seems like all of the women were not impressed with Juan Pablo and how he did not seem genuine in wanting to be there! Jilted exes? I would say the very least. It got harsh at times and I almost felt bad for Juan Pablo, which is hard for me to even type!\n\nTonight on The Bachelor 2014, his journey comes to an end and the final decision is made. Will it end in Juan Pablo getting down on one knee and proposing to his future wife? Which women (Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell) will go home with a broken heart?

But her time in the Fantasy Suite made her realize Juan Pablo knew absolutely nothing about her.\n\nNikki and JP went horseback riding.

But someone will win the final rose, FWIW.\n\nBarring a stunning development in which Juan pulls a Brad Womack and picks no one this evening either Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley will win Season 18.\n\nWe could actually see that happening, for sure, but The Bachelor spoilers indicate he does in fact choose someone. But who? And how? And does it last?\n\nFor those details, just read on, The Bachelor fans ...\n\nSo will Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become Juan Pablo's wife? We're going to go ahead and say no and no, based on what we know of this guy.\n\nThat said, Galavis does choose one woman over the other:\n\nNikki Ferrell will walk away as your winner this evening.\n\nThe most controversial and least popular Bachelor ever has been accused of not taking this so seriously, and according to Reality Steve, doesn't propose.\n\nAccording to inside sources, Galavis is still \"hurt\" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and \"doesn't necessarily find his soul mate with Clare and Nikki.\"\n\nIt is speculated that Juan Pablo and the winner \"left as a couple\" after the St. Lucia season finale, but there are no engagement or marriage plans. At all.\n\nSo are they still together, since that was October?\n\nRumors have suggested that when the After The Final Rose special airs tonight, we'll learn that they aren't even together after the \"journey\" we just watched.\n\nNot necessarily, the latest reports indicate.\n\nThey are still together as of the ATFR taping, and not only that, the producers are trying to convince Juan Pablo Galavis to propose on the broadcast!\n\nThink he will? We have serious doubts.\n\nThe Bachelor spoilers and predictions have been accurate this season, so we're still anticipating a very short lived relationship between Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell.\n\nStill, we've been wrong before, more than once, and until you watch The Bachelor online (or live), you'll ever know with 100 percent certainty what happens.\n\nUPDATE: It's over! Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis are a couple!\n\nThat's right, a couple. She got the rose, but he didn't propose.\n\nClare Crawley got the boot, and Nikki won. But that's it.\n\nA quick rundown on the season finale:\n\nHe told Nikki that he had a ring in his pocket, but he's \"not gonna use it\" because he's \"not 100 percent\" sure he wants to marry her, but \"I like you a lot.\"\n\nSomehow, she accepted the final rose anyway.\n\nHe told Clare something so offensive that she won't even repeat it on the program and she can't even bear the thought of talking to him again.\n\nHis big \"surprise\" was that they are still together!\n\nHe won't say \"I love you,\" but they're a couple.\n\nWe think. They don't seem to have any plans.\n\nHe seems like kind of a jerk to be honest.\n\nAs for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, we'll have to wait until the After the Final Rose special, and likely a long time beyond that, to find out ...\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki: Will it last?\n\nYes.

The fact that only Ferrell's family seemed to embrace Galavis is a point in her favor.\n\nBut Crawley, too, appears to have a strong hold on Galavis, as the duo was seen discussing their wedding song in one of the deleted episodes.\n\nIn the clip, Galavis is seen taking out his cell phone, making Crawley feel that he is going to take a selfie. But the bachelor plays Josh Krajcik's \"No Better Lovers,\" which immediately bring tears to Crawley's eyes.\n\n\"I love this song,\" Crawley says before kissing Galavis, who in turn comforts crying Crawley saying: \"We started like that. Don't cry.\"\n\nCrawley then tells him that they should play the song when they get married. The former Venezuelan soccer did not respond to the suggestion, instead just kissed her.\n\nLater, during a confessional interview, Crawley said that she became emotional as she was caught up in the moment.\n\n\"I am lost in the moment. That song is how I feel and how I felt.\"\n\n\"Juan Pablo has definitely helped to break down those walls that have been up around my heart,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Reality Steve, a blogger who said Ferrell would be crowned the winner much before the current season premiered on ABC, is sticking to his prediction. But he notes that there might not be an engagement when the show ends.\n\n\"Juan Pablo and Nikki left Saint Lucia as a couple, but not engaged. First time in 10 seasons, there hasn't been a proposal at the end,\" Steve writes in his blog. He also added that there is a monetary offer for Galavis to propose to Ferrell on the \"After the Final Rose\" show.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Steve's prediction will prove to be accurate.\n\nThe season finale of \"The Bachelor\" will be telecast on Monday at 8 pm on ABC.\n\n(Edited by Anu James)", "263": "\n\n\n\nSun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our NBC KIDS: Johnny Sequoyah, above, stars in Believe Monday night at 10, and Benjamin Stockham, right, stars in the sitcom About A Boy Tuesday at 9 p.m.Sun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our Smugmug site.\n\nThe Bachelor -- ABC, Monday, 8 p.m.\n\nWill Juan Pablo Galavis walk away with a wife?\n\nOr really, will ABC let him?\n\nThe show has set up Juan Pablo as too much of an idiotic, insensitive villain and endured too many feminist online think-pieces to allow its protagonist any modicum of satisfaction.\n\nMy hopeful prediction?

He said gay men tend to be more \"perverted\" as justification for why such a casting change may be inappropriate for ABC's show.During his season, Galavis was also known for sending his bachelorettes mixed signals -- prompting bachelorette Andi Dorfman to call him a \"rude, arrogant asshole\" after their \" disaster \" of a fantasy-suite date.The woman to receive Galavis' final rose also reportedly leaked a nude photo the former pro soccer player sent her recently, and news had surfaced in early January that Galavis is a deadbeat dad who owed his ex-girlfriend thousands of dollars in unpaid child-support payments for their four-year-old daughter Camila.All of the recent controversies reportedly led ABC to change its mind about wanting Galavis to be a member of Dancing with the Stars' eighteenth-season cast", "279": "Juan Pablo is in hot water again, however this time it\u2019s due to his antics with the women of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d JP, who has sky rocketed to fame as the first Latino \u201cBachelor\u201d finds himself at the center of another controversy when he retweeted a fan on Thursday that wrote a rather thoughtless joke on the social media site, the joke was poking fun at people who suffer from mental handicaps, and plainly was just insensitive. The joke, which to clarify was not written by Juan Pablo, but was retweeted to his Twitter profile read, \"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!\" After posting the tactless poem to his profile, Juan Pablo added \u201c\"JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT...\" however since the backlash his comment of intense laughter and praise has since been deleted.\n\nAfter receiving an angry barrage of messages via Twitter, Juan Pablo went back on the site in an effort to defend himself writing, \"I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK English and a LITTLE bit of Portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture.\" The star of ABC\u2019s hugely popular dating seris continued his rant stating, \"Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.\" What Juan Pablo is perhaps missing is that not only was his word choice offensive, the indication that all those with mental disability lack the competence to read and not feed themselves crayons is just completely outlandish. Juan Pablo needs a stern lesson in the way of the world, and even is defense of his tweet was lacking claiming the difference in language to be the major cause for concern. The implication and insensitive nature of the joke is offensive, in addition to his use of the r-word.\n\nJuan Pablo\u2019s apology/defense of this joke continued throughout the day with the singe dad also tweeting, \"Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture.\" His hastags may be the most telling pat of this apoplgy, which truly shine light on the issue of jokes of this nature. By urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor\u201d to \u201clearn culture\u201d Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people. Moreover the insistence to \u201copen your mind\u201d is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering. Do I think he intentionally meant to offend anyone? No-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance.", "280": "Juan Pablo Galavis\n\nIt's no secret there's been a ton of negativity surrounding this season of The Bachelor. But while fans, celebrity and otherwise, have shared their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo, it's also been one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history. Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?\n\nThe Bachelor: Where are they now?\n\nWhen host Chris Harrison announced on The Bachelorette's After the Final Rose special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice. Unlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on The Bachelorette without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.\n\n\"You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time,\" Harrison tells TVGuide.com. Prior to the announcement, TVGuide.com users certainly agreed with that sentiment, as Juan Pablo received 40 percent of nearly 10,000 votes cast about who should be the next Bachelor.\n\nThe Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy\n\nHeading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its \"Juan-uary\" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a three-year ratings high for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo infamously said in an interview that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were \"more pervert.\" The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo posted an apology, but the dust never really settled.\n\nA couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's late-night swim with Clare, which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer Sharleen exited just before hometown dates saying, \"There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me.\"\n\nDuring fantasy suite week, Andi also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show. \"I've done more interviews \u2014 random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times \u2014 about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera,\" Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the \"Women Tell All\" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star. (Even the majority of TVGuide.com users for the first time, when asked if Juan Pablo should choose Nikki or Clare, chose neither.)\n\nThe Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic Bachelorette\n\nBut has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star Sean Lowe, who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant Catherine on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of Ben Flajnik's Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of The Voice are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.)\n\n\n\nSo, is Juan Pablo truly a \"bad\" Bachelor? \"I don't know how you answer that,\" Harrison says. \"Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.\n\n\n\nBachelor's Chris Harrison breaks down hometowns, previews Andi's \"nightmare\" fantasy suite\n\n\"We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion,\" Harrison continues. \"Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve.\"\n\nDespite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. \"We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera,\" Harrison says. \"We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was.\"\n\nSo, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? \"I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor,\" Harrison says. \"It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next.\"\n\nThe Bachelor's three-hour finale airs on Monday at 8/7c on ABC. What did you think of this season?", "281": "After a dramatic season full of tears, breakups and crazy drunken meltdowns, Season 18 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is coming to a close. On Monday, Juan Pablo will be forced to choose between Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. And while viewers of the ABC series are dying to know who the single dad will choose, the main focus of the after-show will be on the next \u201cBachelorette.\u201d\n\nAs we previously reported, \u201cThe Bachelor\u2019s\u201d season finale will run three hours instead of the normal two. But the third and final hour of the show won\u2019t be dedicated to the final rose ceremony. Instead it will be the \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d special.\n\nAccording to a synopsis from ABC, \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d will feature a live sitdown with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they \u201cdiscuss his final two women of the season, Clare and Nikki.\u201d Juan Pablo will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the \u201cshocking outcome\u201d of the 2014 \u201cBachelor\u201d season.\n\nSpecial guests Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Juan Pablo\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d will be in the audience, along with former \u201cBachelor\u201d/ \u201cBachelorette\u201d success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried. And \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d will feature another mystery guest \u2013 the next \u201cBachelorette.\u201d\n\nWhile the new \u201cBachelorette\u2019s\u201d name has yet to be released, many \u201cBachelor\u201d viewers are speculating (and hoping) that Andi Dorfman will be named Juan Pablo\u2019s successor. Andi quickly became a fan favorite in season 18, despite being the last girl to land a one-on-one date. Making it past hometown dates, Andi\u2019s relationship with Juan Pablo went downhill after her overnight fantasy suite date with him turned into a nightmare. Andi accused Juan Pablo of \u201cname dropping,\u201d not listening to her, and telling her that she was in the final three by \u201cdefault.\u201d The pair had a nasty showdown in St. Lucia before Andi eliminated herself from the competition.\n\nAnd fans aren\u2019t the only ones of Team Andi for \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d Desiree Hartsock, who was \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in 2013, wrote on her blog that she believes the Atlanta woman will take the torch.\n\n\u201cAndi stayed true to how she felt about Juan the day she decided to go home and [stood by her story of] what happened in the fantasy suite,\u201d Des write. \u201cSince she has been a fan favorite throughout this season, I am speculating that she will be the next Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nDo you think Andi will be announced as the next \u201cBachelorette\u201d?

News.\n\nFans immediately took to social media, criticizing the star for the post, and the tweet has since been deleted.\n\nJuan Pablo caused a stir back in January when he told a reporter he didn\u2019t think a gay or bisexual Bachelor would set a good example for kids because gays were more, \u201cpervert, in a sense.\u201d\n\nThe reality star attempted to rectify the situation by blaming the comments on a language barrier, saying that the word \u201cpervert\u201d in Spanish is not as offensive. He used the same excuse this time around, blaming his latest tweet on cultural differences.\n\n\u201cIn Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD...

News, the \"Women Tell All\" special was pretty heavily edited and some of the juiciest drama was left out. During the special, which aired on Mar. 3, fans saw the ladies of \"The Bachelor\" rip into Juan Pablo but viewers got a much tamer version.\n\nDuring the show, several of the ladies called out Juan Pablo for not spending enough time with everyone and really getting to know them. A couple felt like he didn't take the show that seriously. He was also called out for his comments about not wanting a gay Bachelor.\n\nE! News was at the taping and dished on which parts was (for whatever reason) cut from the show. The most edited part of the \"Women Tell All\" was JP's conversation with Kelly about why a gay Bachelor wouldn't be a good idea. Kelly was really upset over the comments because she has two fathers.\n\n\"It was way more heated than what was televised, with Kelly and Juan Pablo fighting over what he said,\" E! wrote.\n\nHost Chris Harrison had to jump in, telling Kelly that she would be able to talk to JP more about it after the taping. The sit-down with the Bachelor himself was said to be heavily edited and was a lot more heated than what was aired. Some of the ladies told him he was \"narcissistic\" and \"not genuine.\"\n\nJuan Pablo reportedly didn't know the ladies were bashing him before he came out because he did not get to see them talking to Chris Harrison but after the taping ended there was no animosity between the ladies and JP. According to E! he hugged and kissed each lady on the cheek after the cameras were off.\n\nLast but not least is Sharleen. E!'s scoop on the opera singer is a little odd but reportedly she was \"a bit more frazzled during filming\" and Harrison had to tell her several times to calm down. She also freaked out a little bit when the AC kicked in at the studio.\n\nThe finale of \"The Bachelor\" airs on ABC Monday at 8 p.m.", "285": "The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis is biting back after several of his former contestants slammed him on the Women Tell All special that aired earlier this week.\n\nJuan Pablo Dating Mystery Woman?\n\nGalavis aired out all of his feelings and slammed many of the women on his People magazine blog Tuesday. He first reprimanded the contestants for not putting themselves in his shoes and considering how difficult it is to have to speak to and try to get to know so many women in such a short amount of time.\n\n\"It's very easy to speak when you only have to focus on one guy, but it's much harder when the guy has to get to know 27 women. It isn't easy to remember all of the conversations or the questions that I ask, but I always tried my best and I wish the women recognized that,\" he wrote.\n\n'Bachelor' Contestants Jealous of Clare?\n\nHe then revealed that he could tell many of the women he eliminated were \"nervous\" when they had conversations with him and knew it would be too hard for them to \"open up\" in that type of environment.\n\n\"The women I had a better connection and attraction with are the ones that I felt fit more into what I was looking for,\" he said.\n\nHe specifically called out Victoria for jumping into a conversation during the special and said she has other things to be concerned about.\n\n\"Ay, Victoria! During my talk with Kelly, Victoria really surprised me. Why did Victoria jump in the conversation? I believe she should have worried more about being sober on the show so she could get to know me rather than say something negative about me when she was there for only four days. Does she know me? Does she know when and where I learned English?\"\n\nHe went on to say that of all of the women on the Women Tell All special, Sharleen and Renee are the ones who know him best.

And I think we all kind of came here to find a husband.\"", "290": "CLE Center Legal Compass Events Webcasts Lawjobs Professional Announcements\n\nPremium Subscription With this subscription you will receive unlimited access to high quality, online, on-demand premium content from well-respected faculty in the legal industry.

And then I spend the next day trying to decipher layers of shrieking and coming up with ha-has while also somehow conveying to you, the reader, all of these idiots\u2019 imagined grievances.\n\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work.\n\nHowever, somewhat remarkably this season the women all seem to get along, with the notable exception of Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 and Nurse Nikki, our remaining contestants. And so, with no Ti-Polar or Villainess to take their rejection, embarrassment and disappointment out on, this season, the ladies have turned their attention to the real bad guy in the room: Juan \u201cIS OKAY\u201d Pablo.\n\nThis is remarkable! Sure, there have been \u201cWomen (and Men) Tell All\u201d specials where some of the contestants turn on the Bachelor (and Bachelorette), but those tend to be isolated incidents involving the contestants who were most recently eliminated and thought they really had a chance to win this thing. Those contestants tend to have developed actual feelings for our hero (or heroine) and were left hurt, humiliated and feeling used. But here, these women did not develop any feelings for Juan Pablo other than disillusionment and un poco disgust.\n\nHow did it come to this? Less than a year ago, Princess Desiree\u2019s \u201cMen Tell All\u201d special\u2019s audience was filled with women screaming for Juan Pablo \u2014 in a good way! \u2014 and a nation was excited to watch this sexy Venezuelan\u2019s \u201cjourney to find love.\u201d But now, having acquainted ourselves with this wishy-washy, homophobic narcissist with a raging madonna/whore complex, the contestants and the audience both have a little less amor for our Latin lover.\n\nAnd las mujeres, they are going to tell him all about it \u2026\n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t just pull out the knives for Juan Pablo right away. Instead, we begin the special with Dallas Sean and New Age Girl as a much-needed reminder that this show isn\u2019t a complete farce \u2014 see? sometimes they get married! and stay married! for a whole month! Of course, if New Age Girl\u2019s comments about their wedding night are to be taken seriously (Dallas Sean: \u201cThere were fireworks!\u201d New Age Girl: \u201cQuick fireworks.\u201d Chris Harrison: \u201c~nervous laughter~\u201d) there might not be much long-term hope for these two.\n\nOther things I learn from this complete waste of my time:\n\nLike most Bachelor contestants, Stingrays are attracted to waxed nipples and other dangly man bits. Dallas Sean and New Age Girl want to start trying for kids in a year or so. New Age Girl thinks 30 is old.\n\nOK, you two please to go away now, I do not want to think about your disappointing sex life ever again.\n\nAnd then there is some terrible Muppets synergy and NO. NO, ABC/DISNEY. I DIDN\u2019T LIKE IT WHEN YOU DID IT ON THE BACHELORETTE AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT LIKE IT HERE. STOP IT. LEAVE. PIGGY. ALONE.\n\nNow for what we all came for: Mujeres, telling \u201call.\u201d The women who were deemed memorable enough to be invited back include: CrazyEyes, Kylie, Nurse Ratched, Elise, Allison, Jacqueline Bisset, Chantal, Angry Kate McKinnon Character, Lauren S, Dirty Feet, Paula Abdul, Chelsie, Kat, Cesar Millan and Molly, Maria Callas, Momma and Abbie Carmichael. Somehow this is not all 25 women who have been eliminated (either by Juan Pablo or of their own conviction), although it seems impossible.\n\nChris Harrison begins by reminding the women that at one point they liked Juan Pablo. Remember that? When you wanted him to propose to you? The ladies all agree that yes, at the beginning they were attracted to him. Come on! He plays soccer! He has a face! He has that often unintelligible accent that disguises the deeply offensive things he\u2019s actually saying!\n\nChris Harrison then wonders if Juan Pablo is so attractive, why wasn\u2019t that enough? Abbie Carmichael has to explain to Chris Harrison likes he\u2019s a fifth grader that a pretty face isn\u2019t everything. Nurse Ratched adds that over the course of several weeks, she came to realize that their conversations weren\u2019t going anywhere, and one of the Laurens, the one who wasn\u2019t eliminated the first night after smearing massage oil all over Juan Pablo\u2019s suit, offers that the only thing Juan Pablo ever asked them was, \u201cWhat do you want to know about me?\u201d\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did.\n\nChris Harrison notes that Momma seemed to have a different relationship with Juan Pablo, why was that? Well, Captain Obvious, maybe it had something to do with the fact that they were both parents, a point that was relentlessly harped on in every episode. But Paula Abdul, who also has a child, notes that he never asked her any questions about herself like, \u201cwhat do you like on your pizza?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d You know, the sort of deeper personal things you should know about someone before you marry them. Alli adds that on one date he asked her where she saw herself in five years, only to then ask her on a subsequent date where she saw herself in three years.\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did!\n\nBut that\u2019s when Abbie Carmichael, of all people, steps in to defend Juan Pablo for being a narcissistic jerkhole. In the end, she thinks that Juan Pablo\u2019s motivation to be on the show was different from theirs: they all came looking for a husband, but maybe he only wants a girlfriend. A girlfriend who is only interested in listening to stories about Juan Pablo, and whose favorite pizza toppings are to remain a mystery for the ages.\n\nThe women then move onto their other issues with Juan Pablo, notably that he kept changing the rules on him. Cesar Millan notes \u2014 accurately \u2014 that Juan Pablo was all about making out with the ladies, except when he wasn\u2019t, in which case he\u2019d whip out the daughter card. Chris Harrison tries to defend Juan Pablo by claiming that parents in relationships have different priorities than non-parents, but that\u2019s nonsense, and he knows it.\n\nKat pipes up that she was irritated by how Juan Pablo constantly referred to Momma and Paula Abdul as his \u201clas especiales,\u201d which, fair enough! Paula Abdul adds to this that she gets why she and Momma were \u201cespecial,\u201d but what she doesn\u2019t get is why he treated the two of them differently from one another: why was he all about getting down with her, but telling Momma he wanted to wait? One of Las Especiales were being disrespected, but she\u2019s not sure which of them it was. PALABRA, GIRL. And Cesar Millan, who is getting more and more worked up by the momento is all, \u201cHE\u2019S A LYING LIAR IS WHAT HE IS.\u201d\n\nChris Harrison changes the topic again: how about that time he and Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 went \u201cswimming?\u201d The mujeres, who had no idea it even happened at the time, remark that they found Juan Pablo taking Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 to his hot tub during their group date FAR more disrespectful than Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 luring him out into the ocean. Todos de las mujeres then jump to the defense of Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1\u2019s honor: how DARE he slut shame her! HE\u2019S the slutty one! SHAME ON HIM.\n\nWell then!\n\nChris Harrison invites Maria Callas to the couch first, explaining that all his time trapped in this hellhole, he\u2019s never seen a relationship quite like Maria Callas\u2019 with Juan Pablo. But instead of explaining that this is because there has never been such a dramatic IQ discrepancy on this show before, the two talk in broad metaphors about roller coasters and things being black and white and how this show isn\u2019t \u201creal life.\u201d Chris Harrison attempts to lure Maria Callas into calling Juan Pablo stupid, reminding her that she was the one who said the cerebral connection was missing and that she wished that she was \u201cdumber.\u201d But Maria Callas never quite arrives there because she has manners and class. In fact, Maria Callas goes out of her way to defend Juan Pablo, assuring the skeptics amongst us that Juan Pablo was \u201ccurious\u201d and that their conversation wasn\u2019t \u201cnon-existent,\u201d which is almost positive!\n\n(This is when the 9-year-old wanders into the room, sees Maria Callas sitting on a couch talking about her \u201cphysical connection\u201d with Juan Pablo, and announces that he thought The Bachelor was \u201ca bunch of women jumping off cliffs and kissing.\u201d You\u2019re not wrong son, you\u2019re not wrong.)\n\nMomma is next on Chris Harrison\u2019s probing couch, and we learn absolutely nothing of interest about Juan Pablo. She had a connection with Juan Pablo because they are both parents (YES, WE KNOW.); She doesn\u2019t regret not telling him that she loved him (GOOD, SHE SHOULDN\u2019T.); She was a little irritated to see him kiss Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 20 seconds after practically having to beg him to kiss her (AS SHE SHOULD BE). The only thing of interest that we learn in this interview is that Momma is in a new relationship that she is reluctant to discuss lest she jinx it. (Actually, she\u2019s engaged! Mazel, Momma! Best wishes to both you and Ben!)\n\nNext up is Abbie Carmichael, Esq. who refused to play along and pretend that she was IN LURRRVE with Juan Pablo after the Fantasy Suite, instead choosing to call him a insensitive egomaniac to his face before dumping him.\n\nAbbie Carmichael explains that when they were first left alone in the Fantasy Suite, it was fine! They talked, they laughed a little, it was a relief to be alone and away from the cameras. But then, all Juan Pablo wanted to talk about was Juan Pablo: soccer and traveling and who he knows. Abbie Carmichael, who if she hasn\u2019t already been chosen to be the next Bachelorette is certainly not discouraging the idea, then makes a shrewd move and claims that Juan Pablo was being \u201cnegative\u201d about the whole process and not grateful for the opportunity he was given \u2014 implying, of course, that she has nothing but respect for the process of dating 25 people at once, and, if she were given the opportunity, she would only be positive about it, always. Well played, madam.\n\nAbbie Carmichael then explains that she thinks Juan Pablo thinks he\u2019s a great Bachelor and the crowd laughs. THIS IS HOW FAR YOU HAVE FALLEN, CHAMO: YOU\u2019VE LOST THE \u201cWOMEN TELL ALL\u201d AUDIENCE.\n\nAbbie Carmichael adds that Juan Pablo also made some disturbing comments about how she was barely still in the competition, and then had the gall to mention his overnight with Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1, who does that? That was the moment when Abbie Carmichael was done with Juan Pablo, and, really, who can blame her? And so she pretended to be asleep and willed dawn to arrive so that she could get away from this huev\u00f3n.\n\nAbbie Carmichael notes that while he was rude and inappropriate and made her feel cheap, she recognizes he didn\u2019t intend to do so \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t have a filter or any understanding of how words work. But what really chaps her hide is that when confronted with his rudeness, Juan Pablo defends himself by claiming he was just being honest, and \u201cis okay.\u201d NO IS OKAY, MARICO.\n\nChris Harrison asks Abbie Carmichael how she\u2019s holding up, and she assures him that she still believes that true love exists and that she will continue to search for it. In fact, she\u2019d be willing to take this \u201cjourney\u201d all over again, if Chris Harrison knows what she means.\n\nFinally, it is Juan Pablo\u2019s turn to come out and defend himself against these raving maenads. Chris Harrison begins by asking Juan Pablo that now, having had a chance to watch himself over the course of the season, does he have any regrets? \u201cNOPE!\u201d Juan Pablo insists, \u201cI\u2019ve been honest from day uno! Sometimes I am rude, yes, but I do not care! It is unimportant to me, your feelings, \u00bfcomprendes?\u201d\n\nThe first woman to confront Juan Pablo is the one who got drunk and tried to kiss him, but he wouldn\u2019t kiss her because he had completely forgotten she was even on the show, but then claimed that the actual reason he isn\u2019t kissing her was because Camila. And she\u2019s like, \u201cSo, yeah, what was up with that, dude? If you weren\u2019t into me, that\u2019s cool, but you didn\u2019t need to drag your daughter into it \u2014 especially when it didn\u2019t stop you from making out with 17 other ladies.\u201d But instead of answering that perfectly reasonable question (although really it was more of a point), Juan Pablo insists that he isn\u2019t letting Camila watch the show. IS OKAY. Well that\u2019s good? I guess? But that was not the pregunta?\n\nChris Harrison points out that while Juan Pablo was reluctant to kiss Momma, he was all over Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1, and Juan Pablo is all, \u201c\u00bfUh, s\u00ed? \u00a1Por supuesto!\u201d Juan Pablo then explains that Momma had told him a story about how her son was devastated by a breakup with her ex-boyfriend, and it made Juan Pablo realize that it he needed to be careful with Momma and her son and take his time.\n\nAt this, Paula Abdul challenges Juan Pablo\u2019s decision to have a hometown visit with Momma and his choice to meet Ben. If Juan Pablo knew Momma wasn\u2019t going to make it to the end \u2014 and let\u2019s be honest, he knew she wasn\u2019t going to make it to the end \u2014 why would he meet her child? Pero Juan Pablo, he no comprende \u2014 why, he introduces first dates to his hija all the time. What\u2019s the gran deal? IS OKAY!\n\nI mean, other than leading an endless parade of women through your daughter\u2019s life, and not giving her an example of a strong stable relationship and establishing the idea that no one ever sticks around in the end, I guess you\u2019ve got a point there, Juan Pablo! I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way!\n\nChantal would like to take exception to the very fact that Juan Pablo set Momma and Paula Abdul aside as Las Especiales in the first place, after all, they all had lives they left behind to be on the show. Juan Pablo argues (not incorrectly) that children are different from jobs or dogs or whatever, that these women left sons behind. Juan Pablo then ruins his argument by unnecessarily adding that it was different for him when he was on The Bachelorette, because Camila had her mother to take care of her. 1. No one was calling you a hypocrite for being on The Bachelorette, but 2. Don\u2019t Momma\u2019s and Paula Abdul\u2019s sons have fathers and grandparents in their lives, so really, it\u2019s not all that different from Camila being with her mother?\n\nCrazyEyes insists that leaving one\u2019s massage table and reflexology charts behind and leaving one\u2019s son behind IS the same thing, WHY WON\u2019T HE ACKNOWLEDGE IT, and Juan Pablo sighs that he knows, he knows, he has compassion, there were just a lot of people he had to get to know and remember, what is her name again?\n\nBut the ladies, they are RILLY RILLY MAD about this whole Las Especiales thing, and Alli demands that he quit saying that he was \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d when he was playing favorites. And look, while I like a good pile-on as much as the next person, don\u2019t any of these women realize that Las Especiales aren\u2019t in the final two and that the only \u201cspecial\u201d treatment that they ultimately received was that one was kept at arm\u2019s length for the majority of the proceedings and the other was sent packing on her birthday?\n\nSo Abbie Carmichael steps in to be the voice of reason, again, and points out that what he meant by \u201cLas Especiales\u201d is that they had to be treated with more care and sent home the moment he knew his relationship with them wasn\u2019t going anywhere. WHICH HE DID. Abbie Carmichael then turns to Juan Pablo and assures him that just because she defended him doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a jerk \u2014 he\u2019s totally a jerk \u2014 but he\u2019s not a jerk because of Momma and Paula Abdul. \u201cIS OKAY,\u201d Juan Pablo chirps.\n\nAbbie Carmichael then notes that one of the things that did bother her was the fact that while they all came here looking for a husband, Juan Pablo seldom used the word \u201cwife.\u201d Nor did he really take the time to get to know them as people, or to learn anything of substance about any of them. \u201cIS OKAY,\u201d Juan Pablo responds.\n\nJuan Pablo goes on to answer that this is just Abbie Carmichael\u2019s opinion \u2014 he learned everything he needed to about them: 1. How well his tongue fit in their mouths and 2. How good they were at listening to stories about Juan Pablo. What else did he need to know? IS OKAY!\n\nChris Harrison drags Maria Callas into the fray, who says that while she felt he took her seriously, she is hearing that the other ladies didn\u2019t have a similar experience. Whaddya gonna do? At this, Dirty Feet wails that the 27 of them just wanted to each have personal relationships with him, to connect with him in a true and meaningful and special way, IS THAT SO MUCH TOO ASK?\n\nAnd then Cesar Millan, who has been uncharacteristically quiet up through the Juan Pablo portion of the evening, announces that she has something to say: \u201cAs someone who has a gay parent, I\u2019d love if you\u2019d explain the comment \u2018The gays are more pervert?\u2019 What was that all about, moj\u00f3n?\u201d Juan Pablo insists, \u201cIS OKAY,\u201d before apologizing for the comment and offering to discuss it after the show, it was taken out of context. \u201cAlright then,\u201d Kelly fires back, \u201ctell me how \u2018pervert\u2019 is out of context. Use your Espa\u00f1ol.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at this point Jacqueline Bisset interjects that as someone who speaks English as a second language herself, she\u2019d appreciate it if Juan Pablo would quit using his language issues as a cop-out for just being rude. Chris Harrison, realizing that these ladies are ready to tear Juan Pablo limb-from-limb, intervenes, and allows Juan Pablo to address the gay pervert issue without interruption.\n\nExcept he does not. Instead, he says he\u2019d rather not waste 4 minutes talking about it here, but rather an hour explaining everything to Cesar Millan privately. He\u2019s not un homophobe! He has gay amigos! Gay amigos who called him after that story came out! He knows gay people were born that way! And you should maybe feel very badly for Juan Pablo because people are still mad at him from that one time he said the horrible thing about an entire group of people being perverts! Maria Callas comes swooping in on his defense, claiming that it wasn\u2019t shown on their date, but this one time they talked about equality issues, and he was totally for it, you guys. Really. No, she\u2019s serious.\n\nAnd with that, Chris Harrison introduces the blooper reel. Longtime readers know that the one depth to which I shall not plunge is \u201cblooper reels,\u201d and so this will go uncommented except to say that in one clip Juan Pablo keeps referring to himself and his \u201cleetle package,\u201d thereby confirming what I suspected really happened in Abbie Carmichael\u2019s Fantasy Suite.\n\nFinally, we are given a preview of the finale which looks like it will be two solid hours of Nurse Nikki and Ni\u00f1a de Pap\u00e1 rolling around on their hotel beds, crying. Who will he choose \u2014 or will he choose anyone? Honestly, the best possible outcome would be that Juan Pablo pulls a Wombat and chooses no one, and these women can go back to their lives knowing they dodged one egomaniacal, small-packaged bullet.\n\nThe Bachelor airs on Mondays at 7 p.m. on ABC.\n\nTherese is also watching Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live, The Walking Dead, The Olympics and Arrested Development kinda, sorta, so go easy on her if these entries are un poco late.", "292": "Find out exactly why ABC won't cast anoverweight 'Bachelor' -- and why they need to!\n\nChris Harrison, host of The Bachelor on ABC, is speaking out on why most of the bachelors are, well, all the same: straight and hot.\n\nWhen asked why there has never been a gay bachelor, Harrison didn't pull a Juan Pablo Galavis and deliver a homophobic remark veiled under an \"But English is my second language!\" excuse. Instead, Harrison was blunt: It's all about the business!\n\n\"The question is: Is it a good business decision?\" told The New York Times Magazine. \"I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell.\"\n\nBut beefcakes do. And that's also why Harrison, though iffy on a homosexual bachelor series, is firmly against a chubby, overweight or obese bachelor.\n\n\"No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say,\" he said. But don't think Harrison thinks he's above it, either. He agrees he'd never be a Bachelor himself!\n\n\"I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive,\" Harrison said. \"Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites.\"\n\nBut he probably likes eating pizza, and he doesn't seem like a complete douchebag, which would be an improvement on the prior Bachelors: Remeber Jake Pavelka, who was super mean to Vienna Girardi when the cameras were off? Or how Galavis boasted to Andi Dorfman about the other women he'd spent the night with already? Or the creepy way Sean Lowe talks about his new sex life with Catherine Guidici?\n\nMaybe a less self-absorbed, vain dude would treat his women better. When it's a choice between respect, devotion and adoration and a few extra pounds, I'll take a little paunch any day. If a man who loves pizza and hamburgers treats you better than a guy with highlights, a fake tan and abs of steel who gorges on grilled chicken and stares at his reflection more than your eyes, go with your gut ... for the guy with a gut.\n\nMore from YourTango:", "293": "Chris Harrison has seen many Bachelors come and go, and whilst he may be on the fence when it comes to having a homosexual one, he definitely does not want to see a chubby leading man!\n\nPhoto credit: Daniel Tanner/WENN.com .\n\nChris Harrison has seen a lot of Bachelors come and go because of his job as the host of ABC\u2019s hit series The Bachelor.\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind at the moment is whether or not there could be the possibility of a homosexual Bachelor on the show in the near future.\n\nThe current leading man, Juan Pablo Galavis, has already caused an uproar on that topic after he said homosexuals are \u201cmore \u2018pervert\u2019 in a sense. And to me the show would be too strong\u2026 too hard to watch.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan star has since backtracked and explained that his comments were the result of a language barrier, the same pressing question is not going away any time soon, and this time, Harrison is in the firing line.\n\nHowever, the 42-year-old TV host was far more diplomatic in his answer, and during his interview with The New York Times Magazine, he confessed he was hesitant about whether there should be a gay Bachelor.\n\nHarrison told the publication, \u201cThe question is: Is it a good business decision?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this \u2014 Look, if you\u2019ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you\u2019ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, \u2018Hey, you should make hamburgers.\u2019 Why? I have a great business model and I don\u2019t know if hamburgers are going to sell.\u201d\n\nAnd although the dating show host may be on the fence about having a gay star on The Bachelor, he definitely is against having a chubby one. When asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, \u201cNo. You know why? Because that\u2019s not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I\u2019m old and unattractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don\u2019t have a 12-pack.

And I don\u2019t eat 50,000 egg whites.\u201d\n\nAnd when asked if Harrison himself would ever like to be a star on The Bachelor, he replied, \u201cNow that I\u2019m divorced, it\u2019s feasible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there needs to be a level of innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9 when you come in to be the Bachelor, and I have none.

And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites,\" Harrison explained.\n\nWhen asked about having a gay Bachelor on the show, Harrison was a little hesitant and said it would depend on whether it would be good for business.\n\n\"I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell,\" Harrison said.\n\nOf course, much has been made about the possibility of having a gay Bachelor after the current Bachelor, Juan Pablo, made a controversial remark and said that a gay Bachelor would not be a \"good example\" because gay people are \"more pervert.\" He later backtracked and said that it was a mistake in translation and that he had no problem with gay people.", "295": "Austin, Texas - Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women's restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it's different.\n\n\"It's definitely changed,\" said Cannon, a vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz here. \"I'm hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It's just, 'Sally, the engineer.'\"\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what traditionally has been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year's main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named \"breakout app\" in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Ore.-based Palo Alto Software, was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry's culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as \"brogrammers.\"\n\n\"Part of that is the 'bro-gramming' and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on,\" she said in an interview before her meeting. \"What women have to push really hard about is you don't have to be successful in a man's world - it's just the world.\"\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference's panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium's director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n\"If I had a dime for everybody who said that's a great rule but there just aren't enough qualified women I'd be rich, rich, rich,\" he said. \"My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It's impossible for me to believe that you can't find a female speaker in the world who isn't extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.\"\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women's issues this year was a March 7 talk \"Starting Up in a Man's World\" that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.", "296": "\u201cThe name of the game at SXSW is to get seen and to be heard,\u201d Ms Millgate said, adding that Sounds Australia manages showcases for musicians at the event. \"You're competing with thousands of other bands\": John Patterson of the Grates. Credit:Edwina Pickles This year's record attendance by local artists owes to a surge in up-and-coming dance and electro acts, following the breakout success of Flume, Flight Facilities and Gold Fields at previous SXSWs. Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts. Australia's electro scene has boomed so much that last year's flagship, the Aussie BBQ, expands this year to include a night dedicated to the dancefloor. \"Beat Pie\" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.\n\nFor relatively new Brisbane indie electro producer Danny Harley, who plays under the moniker the Kite String Tangle, SXSW will be his first gig overseas. He says the chance owes to the breakthrough success of his electro hit Given the Chance. The track has amassed almost 900,000 Soundcloud plays since its release in August and charted at No. 19 in Triple J's Hottest 100 \u2013 a solid achievement given Harley is yet to release an EP or album. \u201cThe success of my current track is largely due to international blogs,\u201d Harley said, adding that \u201cthe online buzz was really valuable for spreading the word about my song. But it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW]\u201d. More than 1700 acts will play at SXSW, but thousands more promoters, managers and labels will lurk behind the scenes, looking out for the next big thing. \u201cFor the most part the acts with the most buzz heading in to the conference are the ones that are most likely to come away from it with success,\u201d Ms Millgate said, pointing to the importance of social media and blogs in building a successful SXSW campaign. It wasn't always like this.\n\nBrisbane indie rocker John Patterson, guitarist for the Grates, described their first trip to SXSW at the start of their career in 2005 as \u201ca bit of a gamble\u201d. At the time, the three-piece had just signed on to their record label in Australia following a handful of homemade EPs and grassroots shows, and going overseas was a financial risk. \u201cSXSW is such a huge event,\" Patterson says. \"There are so many opportunities for things to get seen and things to get missed . . . you're competing with thousands of other bands.\" But their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal. They have since returned twice, in 2006 and 2009, to promote new material. The sentiment is shared by fellow Brisbane indie four-piece the Jungle Giants, who are making their SXSW debut.\n\nWhile they have gained renown at home after touring with the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and the Falls Festival, they're cutting their teeth overseas. \u201cIt's only now become financially feasible to head over to America, so it's all culminated to this point,\" frontman Sam Hales said. As an unsigned band he hopes the Jungle Giants will meet international labels and garner the release of their debut album, Learn to Exist, overseas, as well as an American tour. Even established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW. ARIA chart toppers Boy and Bear will head to the conference for their second time, and as drummer Tim Hart said, it's almost like starting again with their new album Harlequin Dream.\n\n\u201cIt's a really interesting thing over there,\" Hart said. \"You're just another band because there are so many other artists. But this is where all the promoters, festival owners and everyone go to and they're looking for acts.\" As a more experienced and mature band, Boy and Bear are ready to make the most out of the SXSW experience, Hart said, and look forward to the networking opportunities.", "297": "As everyone heads to Austin for the music portion of the 2014 SXSW festival, here are the ten bands we\u2019re most excited about seeing\n\nAngel Olsen\n\nThe Missouri-born singer\u2019s simple chords and powerful yet intimate vocals tell you it\u2019s ok to be lonely. Who needs more than thoughtful songs combined with grunge guitar? Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.\n\nJamestown Revival\n\nJamestown Revival is essentially Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, two guys from a little town called Magnolia, Texas who have been singing together since they were kids. They have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.\n\nNo\n\nThis L.A.-based rock band draws comparisons to The National thanks to the deep baritone of Bradley Hanan Carter and lyrics like \u201cWe make some noise inside a room and call it art\u201d on their dramatic new single \u201cLeave the Door Wide Open.\u201d\n\nThe Preatures\n\nHailing from Sydney, Australia the band\u2019s latest album Is This How You Feel? is out now on Harvest Records. Isabella Manfredi and Gideon Benson trade off vocal duties over a beat of rhythm-focused \u201970s pop.\n\nJetta\n\nAs a backup singer Jetta has been on the road with Paloma Faith and Cee Lo Green. Now, we get to hear her commanding voice as she steps forward to perform her own songs. \u201cFeels Like Coming Home\u201d is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.\n\nCloud Nothings\n\nThe first single from their next album (due in April), \u201cI\u2019m Not Part of Me\u201d strikes a balance between noisy pop punk and hummable hooks.\n\nNikki Lane\n\nThe country singer\u2019s sophomore album (out May 6), produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, is an eagerly anticipated way for the sweet and sour singer to croon that it\u2019s \u201calways the right time to do the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nFuture Islands\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz for the combo of cool synth pop and Samuel T. Herring\u2019s dramatic vocals. Along with a Coachella appearance and a number of sold out headlining dates, the band played The Late Show and will release its new album Singles on March 25.\n\nThe Autumn Defense\n\nSince 1999, this has been a side-project for John Stirratt, the bass player in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, as he collaborates with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone on \u201960s rock and pop. Their fifth LP, cleverly called Fifth, was released this past January on Yep Roc.\n\nSpeedy Ortiz\n\nThis Massachusetts band, led by Sadie Dupuis, brings \u201890s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century. The quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year.\n\nJust because we love the name: Potty Mouth\n\nAnd a few Los Angeles-based acts we\u2019d like to get to: Avi Buffalo, The Blank Tapes, Eleni Mandell, Kelela, Dum Dum Girls, Holly Conlan, Banks, and Fever the Ghost.", "298": "Forget the haters, South By Southwest is worth gawking at\n\nI'm sorry. It's that time of year. I'm going to write about South by Southwest.\n\nThis will be my third year attending and covering the festival, and I apologize because I've grown a sense of guilt about it. Mocking SXSW is about as common and easy as mocking Coachella or Miley Cyrus. The other thing those three have in common, though, is that they're actually fun if you can manage to not be an eye-rolling, better-than-thou contrarian.\n\nLook, I'm not clueless and neither are most people who go to Austin in March. The festival isn't what it used to be, it's too corporate, it's over-hyped, it's not the real Austin, etc. They're valid issues, but there are valid reasons not to do a lot of fun things. If you have the press pass and/or the financial means, why not? And if you don't, why not pay attention, even peripherally?\n\nAshley Dean\n\nSXSW's music festival is still a great place to find bands. Last year, I caught shows from the Whiskey Shivers and Ringo Deathstarr. In the year since, I brought them both into Second Story Garage. Oddly enough, the first time I ever saw some Colorado bands was at SXSW two years ago. Just following the coverage might give you a handful of new bands to check out.\n\nAustin is weird, as any souvenir T-shirt will tell you, and SXSW acts as an amplifier. The weirdness isn't even coming from locals half the time, for the month of March. Maybe you have to be of a certain age or disposition to enjoy wading through a litter-strewn and crowded Sixth Street, enjoying dancing sousaphone players or dancing skeleton marionettes. That's cool. Enjoy it emanating from your computer screen instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sounds like a pitch, and I guess in a way it is, but mostly it's an argument in favor of chilling out and enjoying something. Maybe SXSW has a confused purpose or significance, but so what? Enjoy the party.\n\nI'll be back at it this year, and by \"it\" I mean following local bands, discovering new ones, subsisting on beer, eating a lot of pulled pork and not sleeping.\n\nHere's the actual pitch: It's all going on SecondStoryGarage.com, as well as ColoradoDaily.com. Last year's highlights included Big Freedia twerking, The Yawpers' Nate Cook getting a little dark and profane on camera, and me drunkenly talking about pizza. Much like SXSW, it's a messy grab bag of stuff.\n\nHope you like it, and as always, happy South By.\n\nContact Ashley Dean at 303-473-1109.

Yet as the music portion of SXSW kicks into gear on Tuesday there\u2019s not nearly the official Toronto presence one might expect on the streets of Austin.\n\nJeff Cohen, a co-owner of the Horseshoe Tavern, says the city is \u201cmaking headway\u201d with its Austin alliance \u201cbut it\u2019s at a turtle pace.\u201d ( Toronto Star file photo ) The Darcys are among the numerous Toronto acts at South by Southwest this week. ( Frank Gunn / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\nOh, there are Toronto acts everywhere at this year, as there always are: F---ed Up, the Darcys, Trust, Timber Timbre, Greys, Lowell, Saidah Baba Talibah among them. Related: What Rob Ford, and Toronto, could learn from Austin's music industry\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nBut the sole event actually bearing the City of Toronto stamp is a late-afternoon showcase titled \u201cToronto Turns Up,\u201d featuring More Or Les, Ariana Gillis, July Talk and the Arkells (who are from Hamilton), at the Canadian Independent Music Association\u2019s \u201cCanada House\u201d headquarters at Friends on 6th St. on Saturday. That\u2019s it. Despite the establishment last month of a 30-member music advisory committee intended to guide Toronto in its efforts to embrace and exploit its thriving music scene in a manner modelled on that of the \u201cLive Music Capital of the World,\u201d only one city staff member, film commissioner Randy McLean (subbing in until Toronto\u2019s plans to establish a music office with an actual music commissioner akin to Austin\u2019s bear fruition) is in Texas in an official capacity for this year\u2019s festival. Several members of that committee are here, yes, but they came on their own (or their company\u2019s) dime, and some of them are wondering if Toronto might not be missing the boat on the whole alliance thing. Even Thursday night\u2019s big \u201cbeat battle\u201d at Avenue on Congress between Toronto\u2019s Beat Academy hip-hop crew, led by sometime Drake producer Boi1da and featuring the rising likes of Wondagurl and Rich Kidd, and Texas\u2019s Space City Beats mob happened of its own volition.\n\nIt was, the Beat Academy\u2019s Toni Morgan says, a \u201chappy coincidence\u201d that they\u2019d been planning a \u201cToronto vs. Texas\u201d SXSW event when the Toronto/Austin alliance came into being. As Jeff Cohen, co-owner of the Horseshoe Tavern and one of the founders of Collective Concerts, observes, Toronto sent two city councillors to SXSW last year and then followed that visit up by sending a delegation back for the Austin City Limits festival last fall that included a very enthusiastic Mayor Rob Ford.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\u201cFive months have passed by since they signed the alliance, and there\u2019s less going on at South by Southwest than there was when there was no alliance,\u201d Cohen said Monday. \u201cI think we\u2019re missing an opportunity. The City of Toronto should have made a big splash at this year\u2019s South by Southwest \u2026 It looks like my city dropped the ball. Both (cities) are just losing this great opportunity. Nothing\u2019s been done.\u201d Cohen isn\u2019t being a totally negative Nelly. He concedes Toronto is \u201cmaking headway\u201d with its Austin alliance, \u201cbut it\u2019s at a turtle pace.\u201d And that\u2019s much the same refrain one hears from his fellow industry compatriots down here for SXSW. \u201cI\u2019m happy that the City of Toronto is moving ahead with stuff like the music advisory committee and clearly it\u2019s on their radar screen as something that should be aided and abetted and supported,\u201d says Mike Tanner, director of operations for Toronto\u2019s North by Northeast festival. \u201cOn the other hand, in my North by Northeast capacity, I know how big the city bureaucracy can be and, in the interests of getting things right and making sure that proper policies and procedures are followed it can take a long time to get stuff done \u2026. \u201cI think it\u2019s kinda down to the industry to do things in a tangible way that has an effect on the street, so that you see musicians or venues or fans or other people benefitting so it\u2019s not just a piece of paper that was signed by two elected politicians, that it actually has a meaning and an impact that people can feel. \u201cI think a lot of times bureaucracies like to work from the top down, but with something like this I think it might be more effective to work from the foundation up, from the actual events and the actual people and the guys on the ground making stuff happen.\u201d To that end, Tanner and the NXNE crew will work on their own to strengthen their long-held ties with SXSW this year to make that connection \u201ca lot more evident and obvious\u201d in light of the new alliance. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in much closer contact with them, sharing some info and some best practices,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there may be something that comes to fruition at our festival. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Likewise, Amy Terrill of the industry lobby group Music Canada and Toronto\u2019s recently minted \u201c4479: Music Meets World\u201d music-marketing campaign will be conducting business with movers and shakers in the Austin scene on \u201ca more informal basis\u201d during SXSW. \u201cFrom the industry level in Austin, there\u2019s a lot of interest,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think the frustration is things move a little bit slowly. Certainly, in Toronto, it\u2019s taken a little while to get the advisory committee set up. But there are necessary foundational pieces, and while we may wish the process went a little bit faster, the committee that Toronto has established is a fantastic committee and there\u2019s gonna be a lot of great people on there and it\u2019s gonna do a lot of great work. \u201cIt\u2019s just that some things take a little bit longer. \u201cI think the industry-led initiative is where the real magic is gonna happen. So I think that\u2019s okay that that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now as the city structures get established.\u201d\n\nRead more about:", "300": "More than 2,000 musical acts have descended on Austin, Texas, for SXSW, and their week of live performances will begin on Tuesday.\n\nWhether you're in Austin poring over the schedules or living vicariously through Instagram photos, the thought of sifting through thousands of musical acts is rather daunting.\n\nSee also: How SXSW Turned Austin Into a Cultural Mecca\n\nFortunately for you, we've rounded up songs from 50 of the best acts playing at SXSW for this week's Music Monday playlist.

Communal bonding? Yes \u2013 somewhere around 100,000 people will wander the Austin streets looking to high-five each other during this time. Fun? For sure. This is the entertainment industry's spring break, with much better music that what you'd hear at the Flora-Bama border, and mercifully fewer bros in board shorts. Excess?

The band was invited to tour with Bon Iver after Justin Vernon was blown away by their dreamy indie pop.\n\nSkaters\n\nListen: \u201cMiss Teen Massachusetts\u201d\n\nThis just-out-of-the-gate New York group delivers energetic garage rock that earns them apt comparisons to The Strokes. Their debut album, Manhattan, is filled with songs that crackle with electricity and infectious enthusiasm sure to make you a fan.\n\nHurray for the Riff Raff\n\nListen: \u201cThe Body Electric\u201d\n\nFrontwoman Alynda Lee Segarra is from New Orleans-by-way-of-The Bronx, and that\u2019s an apt description for her music, too. Her debut album, Small Town Heroes, gracefully blends idiosyncratic eras and genres for a sweetly gritty Americana sound.\n\nThe Wytches\n\nListen: \u201cDigsaw\u201d\n\nThis Brighton, UK-based three-piece are riding a wave of surf-psych rock across the pond in the hopes of putting America under their spell. The band cites Leonard Cohen and Black Sabbath as influences for the narco-hazy \u201cPaint It Black\u201d-esque riffs they\u2019ve dubbed \u201csurf doom,\u201d but there\u2019s no real comparison for their sound.\n\nSir Sly\n\nListen: \u201cGold\u201d\n\nAlt-pop trio Sir Sly have flown under the radar in the States so far, but they are poised to make big waves at SXSW. The band is signed to the same UK label who preached the gospel of Haim, Atlas Genius and Chvrches early on \u2014 and Cherrytree Records in the U.S., which is home to Feist, Robyn and Disclosure among others\u2014 and Sir Sly\u2019s dark pop tunes fit in well with that company. Their danceable, if occasionally melancholic, tracks are laden with enough pop hooks and sing-along choruses to be genuine crowdpleasers.\n\nTink\n\nListen: \u201cTake Me There\u201d\n\nChicago upstart Trinity Home, a.k.a. Tink, could be either the next Nicki Minaj or the next Ashanti, and she has the chops to rival both. On the four mix tapes the 18-year old has released so far, she drifts effortlessly between R & B groovers and knock-\u2019em-down, beat-laden tracks \u2014 and delivers on all fronts.\n\nDawn Landes\n\nListen: \u201cBluebird\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky-bred New Yorker just released her first full-length in four years and she makes up for lost time on Bluebird. The album is a smart mix of alt-folk, country and indie pop experimentation that goes down like a beer bong of sweet tea.\n\nAan\n\nListen: \u201cI Don\u2019t Need Love\u201d\n\nPortland, Ore., has a reputation for being a hothouse for musical taste-makers and trendsetters. Aan makes good on that reputation with their complex, challenging rock. The band has been around since 2007, but only recently put out their debut album, Amor Ad Nauseum. Apparently it can take awhile to capture their brand of perfection.\n\nTemples\n\nListen: \u201cShelter Song\u201d\n\nTemples have been making a name for themselves in England\u2019s psychedelic pop scene, based on their undeniably groovy sound, which is rooted in the 1960s with hefty helpings of Motown, glam and Krautrock sprinkled throughout. Temples have been receiving lots of well-deserved attention throughout the UK, including praise from the likes of Johnny Marr and Oasis\u2019 Noel Gallagher.\n\nTorres\n\nListen: \u201cHoney\u201d\n\nSinger-songwriter Torres mines the same musical vein that Sharon Van Etten and Waxahatchee do, and strikes gold each time she hits the stage with her lucky Gibson guitar in hand. Torres comes to her shows armed with a gorgeous, vulnerable croon and a litany of intricate, tender songs sure to woo all comers.\n\n\n\nSeptember Girls\n\nListen: \u201cHeartbeats\u201d\n\nThe band may take their name from a Big Star song, but the songs that the Dublin five-piece craft sound like what would happen if the Bangles started a My Bloody Valentine cover band. The floating vocals and fuzzed out guitar make for memorable tunes and inescapable earworm melodies.\n\nTensnake\n\nListen: \u201cLove Sublime\u201d feat. Nile Rogers and Flora\n\nBerlin-based producer Tensnake knows how to fill a dance floor and has traveled the world doing just that for years, building a reputation as one of the premiere house and disco producers out there. Now he is getting ready to release his debut album, Glow. It\u2019s due out March 11th but is already earning accolades for its raw emotion, crossover dance-pop appeal and modern disco feel.\n\n\u00c1sgeir\n\nListen: \u201cKing and Cross\u201d\n\n\u00c1sgeir Trausti is barely known in the U.S. \u2014 but in Iceland he\u2019s huge. One in 10 Icelanders own his album, In the Silence, which has already outpaced sales of albums by fellow Icelandic acts Bj\u00f6rk and Sigur R\u00f3s. The 22-year old singer-songwriter works in sweetly hushed acoustic numbers with lyrics frequently penned by his 70-something father, accompanied by synths and pianos and electronic trappings, which, when paired with his soaring voice, build irrepressible harmonies sure to win over audiences outside of Iceland in no time.\n\nAlvvays\n\nListen: \u201cAdult Diversion\u201d\n\nToronto\u2019s Alvvays are a vvarmly bright new project by Molly Rankin, who is descended from Canadian folk royalty and uses her talents to make wistfully jangly, bittersweet Brit pop. The quintet\u2019s lo-fi sound pairs perfectly with Rankin\u2019s breathy vocals to create guitar-driven confections sure to earn a place on your playlist.\n\nBipolar Sunshine\n\nListen: \u201cLove More Worry Less\u201d\n\nAdio Marchant, a.k.a. Bipolar Sunshine, infuses warmth into his electronic-tinged pop songs. He cites David Bowie, Kanye West, reggae and The Carpenters among those who influenced his songs, which frequently pair heartfelt, yearning lyrics with lush arrangements. His distinctive style will undoubtedly garner this British singer/songwriter plenty of attention in Texas.\n\nBlack Milk\n\nListen: \u201cSunday\u2019s Best / Monday\u2019s Worst\u201d\n\nDetroit-based producer and rapper Curtis Cross, a.k.a. Black Milk, has worked with J. Dilla, Danny Brown and Jack White, but is making a name for himself with his album No Poison No Paradise. The semi-autobiographical album tells the story of a man and his dreams in a flurry of unrelenting rap that will take you to church and back again.\n\nAva Luna\n\nListen: \u201cPRPL\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn five-piece delivers soulful funk sounds with pretty harmonies and an endearingly punky brashness. The band just released their second album, Electric Balloon, and to call it an eclectic mix is an understatement. The band blends full-on no wave rockers with R & B inspired slow burners with a little of everything in between, which just means that there\u2019s something for everyone at their shows.\n\nMORE: 14 Musical Acts To Watch in 2014\n\nMORE: 14 Albums To Look Forward To In 2014\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "304": "Looking below the radar of pop culture in L.A. and beyond.

I arrived in Austin this weekend with just that \u2014 plus my bicycle \u2014 to cover South by Southwest for Take Two.\n\nOn Sunday, I headed over to the interactive show floor to check out the best new digital creations. What I discovered was a whole lot of gimmicks.\n\nTake this life size \"Operation\" board, for example.\n\nAnd then there were the folks who lined up to play the \"Price is Right.\"\n\nFun and games at SXSW\n\nI did, however, discover some pretty awesome wearable tech in a conference room at the Hilton. Interested in an Iron Man-like motorcycle helmet? Listen in to my Take Two segment for more.\n\nCompletely wrecked by jet lag and daylight saving, I made my way to Joe's Bakery with Armando Rayo Monday morning for the pride of Austin breakfast cuisine. Not everything is bigger in Texas. Case in point: instead of eating giant breakfast burritos like we do here in California, Austinites prefer small breakfast tacos.\n\nFull of bacon, cheese, eggs, Mexican chorizo, salsa verde, jalapenos, beans and tons of other homemade goodness \u2014 this is what Texans love. When I brought up the idea of breakfast burritos to an owner at Joe's, she scoffed and said that people from California always ask for them. She didn't understand why.\n\nI'll refrain from debating the merits of the breakfast burrito vs the breakfast taco here \u2014 because I'll be doing exactly that on Take Two Tuesday.\n\nCheck out KPCC for daily updates from Jacob.

Before heading out, I surveyed a baker's dozen of Portland bands to see why the trek's worth it and named a few local acts to watch out for among the thousands invading the city.\n\nI've been in Austin a day and a half and already been to an ear-rattling house show, eaten a fried avocado taco and attempted to devour a full pound of brisket and ribs from Austin BBQ institution Franklin. (I failed; I'll try again when they're in town in August for Feast Portland.) Check in on Oregonlive.com/music and Twitter all week for photo galleries, behind-the-scenes moments and live updates on bands from Portland and beyond.\n\nThe fest kicks off properly on Tuesday, with the locals-only Portland Party on Wednesday afternoon -- look for my galleries and write-ups to follow. I'll also be moderating an SXSW panel on Thursday about modern music discovery with Bandcamp's Andrew Jervis and others. I'll be skipping the Lady Gaga Doritos concert, though.\n\nAre you in Austin? Let me know. If not: what do you want to see covered this week? Band discoveries? Interviews? Portraits? Taco photos? I'll do my best to make it happen.\n\n-- David Greenwald", "306": "Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women\u2019s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed,\u201d said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. \u201cI\u2019m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It\u2019s just, \u2018Sally, the engineer.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male- dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nI\u2019m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook Inc.\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nBro-gramming Culture\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year\u2019s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named \u201cbreakout app\u201d in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry\u2019s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as \u201cbrogrammers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of that is the \u2018bro-gramming\u2019 and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,\u201d she said in an interview before her meeting. \u201cWhat women have to push really hard about is you don\u2019t have to be successful in a man\u2019s world \u2014 it\u2019s just the world.\u201d\n\nLook Harder\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference\u2019s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium\u2019s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n\u201cIf I had a dime for everybody who said that\u2019s a great rule but there just aren\u2019t enough qualified women I\u2019d be rich, rich, rich,\u201d he said. \u201cMy reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It\u2019s impossible for me to believe that you can\u2019t find a female speaker in the world who isn\u2019t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.\u201d\n\nMan\u2019s World\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women\u2019s issues this year was a March 7 talk \u201cStarting Up in a Man\u2019s World\u201d that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.\n\nThe lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.\n\nParsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.\n\nThe number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers\n\nEllen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.\n\nC-Suite Women\n\nStill, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book \u201cLean In\u201d to inspire other females.\n\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers \u2014 like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,\u201d she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. \u201cThey have the ideas, but they don\u2019t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.\u201d\n\nwww.bloomberg.com", "307": "Head here to visit The 405's SXSW 2014 hub.\n\nWith the Music side of SXSW kicking off today, Shell Zenner has put together a rather handy A-Z guide of bands playing this week. She's also put together a playlist, which you can listen to below.\n\nThe 1975 - are impossible to categorise, so it's quite fitting that they are the only number-based band that I've mentioned in this list. Their debut self-titled album was a smash hit in the UK in 2013 and the US should take notice.\n\nA-ges and Ages have a sound that builds and builds and I think that their folky uplifting vibes will generate one of the feel good sets of the festival. If you're more of a cool kid, then Neon Gold records ASTR, a duo from New City and their electronic vibes should enlighten your ears. If you like your music more on the eclectic side of the tracks then don't miss Afrikan Boy.\n\nB-ANKS has been all over the tips for 2014 lists and I'll be vying for a place in a venue to see her showcase her incredible vocals. Manchester son Bipolar Sunshine will be bringing his impressive pop vibes along for the ride, or if you need to check a raw live show then Bo Ningen are the band for you. Austin favourites The Black Angels and the Black Lips will be rocking out and Bear's Den, Boy & Bear and Breton will all be an impressive watch. Personally I'm hoping to grab my first glance of Big Ups and a shed load of BBQ.\n\nC-hance The Rapper's shows would probably only be harder to get into if he was wearing a meat dress.. so queue early guys and gals. Cate Le Bon's live shows are an absolute treat so try not to miss out! Sheffield band The Crookes secured UK music industry funding to bring third album Soapbox back to the US and other recommendations on my list are Carousel, Casual Sex, Chloe Howl, CYMBALS, Chet Faker and Cherry Glazerr.\n\nD-renge have slayed everything and everyone in their path over the past couple of years and Austin is the next place on their list. Watch out! Electronic vibes aplenty with Duologue and Dauwd playing and UK acts Daley and Dems should figure in your plans too.\n\nE-agulls released their incredible punk debut album last week, Electric eye and Empress Of impressed me at Iceland Airwaves festival and Ezra Furman will be a definite one to check out live.\n\nF-at White Family's shows have been renowned in the UK of late as messy and mental affairs and it's bound to be HOT HOT HOT in Austin. Austin based Feathers toured with Depeche Mode in the last month or so. Liverpool artist Forest Swords released a rather special album in 2013 which you really should hear.\n\nG-ossling has an unmistakeable voice that I can't wait to check out live, but you should wrap your ears around Glass Animals, Glitches, GRMLN and Gems too!\n\nH-ighasakite sound delicious in more ways than one with their brand of Norwegian indie pop and are high on my list to check out live. H Hawkline not only plays in Cate Le Bon's band but will be stepping out of the shadows to play solo at the festival. HAERTS and Holy Esque will also be showcasing new music which I'm keen to hear.\n\nI-ndian Jewelry were completely impressive at Austin Psychfest 2013 and lend a slightly more leftfield sound to the proceedings. The Burger Records and Austin Psychfest line-ups will be must sees this year.\n\nJ-ungle are incredibly hard to google, very mysterious and will be one of the hype bands at this year's festival. Jessy Lanza and Jetta will also be on my list of fresh new female talent to check on the show this year!\n\nK-ins are from Brighton yet I travelled to Leicester to finally see them live. Saying that, they're worth travelling to Austin to see. I have yet to experience the wonder that is Kirin J Callinan live - his one Manchester show had rave reviews and I'll see you down the front yeah?\n\nL-a Luz from Seattle are an all girl group that I wish to get to know better! I won't be missing them for sure. Lizzo will be offering some bangers and other choice picks are London Grammar, Lowell and the upbeat sound of Lucius.\n\nM-\u00d8 is at the top of my M list after a huge queue stopped me seeing her In Iceland! Melt Yourself Down have incredible live shows though, so get yourself down for sure!\n\nN-o Joy and their brooding sound will bliss you out and Nina Nesbitt is certainly one to watch.\n\nThe O-rwells ramshackle and energetic live show will be just the tonic after too many tacos.\n\nP-erfect Pussy released a tape on Captured Tracks last year and have their debut album due for release next week. Manchester babes Pins will blow your mind and if you want to get stoned and starving, I suspect there is no one better to do it with than Parquet Courts. Painted Palms, Panama, Petite Noir, Phantogram, The Preatures and Prides are also stellar additions to the SXSW line up.\n\nQ-uilt. Yes I love my bed and their album HUGELY. Must see.\n\nR-oyal Blood have UK shows set up supporting Arctic Monkeys and were one of the BBC's tips for 2014. You'd be a fool not to see them. Radkey, Rathborne, RDGLDGRN, Roosevelt, Royal Canoe and Ryan Hemsworth are all on my list too!\n\nS-pires just released a seven inch on Too Pure Singles club and if you dig Temples then check them. Jules and Sandra from Dum Dum Girls feature in Sisu who I'll definitelu be checking out and I'm in love with the poppy summery Ski Lodge album so I'll be seeing that for sure! Montreal's Solids, Supreme Cuts and Sylvan Esso will be in demand too.\n\nT-humpers released their debut album on Subpop recently and have supported Chvrches too! Tallows, Team Me, TEEN, Teeth Of The Sea, To Kill A King, TOPS, TORRES, Tourist, Traams and of course Temples will all be a good way to spend your time.\n\nU-ntil The Ribbon Breaks will be playing the British Embassy alongside UNKNWN and it's a free RSVP if you're quick.

You will be after five days full on in Austin!\n\nY-oung Summer is the moniker of DC based singer songwriter Bobbie Allen who's at the top of my Y list, closely followed by Young Fathers and Young Magic.\n\nThe Z-oltars are based in Austin, channel garage rock vibes and have released on Burger and Sundae Records.

The winners each received $4,000, an invitation to next year\u2019s convention, and most importantly, a prestigious and historically lucrative title in the world of technology startups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for us, and what\u2019s most important is the exposure that comes with it,\u201d Connor Dickie, whose Canadian company won in the competition\u2019s innovative world category, said in an interview following the event. \u201cIt shows people what we\u2019re doing and where biotech is heading.\u201d\n\nDickie\u2019s company, Synbiota, offers an online, crowdsourced platform where scientists can share information and streamline the research and development stages in the production of new foods, fuels and medicines. Some of the funding the company received Sunday will go toward a \u201chackathon\u201d the company plans to host in Ontario bringing together Internet wizards and biotech scientists.\n\nIn the wearable technology category, Skully Helmets of San Francisco won for its motorcycle helmet that displays information like driving directions inside the visor and features a rear-view camera that allows riders to see directly behind them without turning their head.\n\nAnother San Francisco company, ThriveOn, came out on top in the health category for an app that provides an online, personalized program meant to improve mental health. And Israeli company Samba.me landed the grand prize in social technology for a video messaging app that captures video of recipients watching the original video and adds their \u201creaction\u201d footage to the original.\n\nIrish startup Trustev won in the big data category for online identity verification software intended to help merchants combat e-commerce fraud. And lastly, in the the entertainment and content contest, Rhode Island-based Waygo came out on top for its mobile app that lets users scroll over text in, say, Chinese or Japanese characters and see in real-time the translation in English.\n\n\u201cThe $4,000 is just icing on the cake,\u201d Ryan Rogowski, one of the founders of Waygo, said in an interview, noting that the company will likely use some of that capital to explore new marketing tactics and distribution channels. \u201cMeeting these other teams and introducing ourselves to new potential investors, that\u2019s the real benefit\u201d he added.\n\nSXSW Accelerator boasts an impressive lists of pasts participants, many of whom were first introduced to the world at South by Southwest.

No question, the phrase \u201cit\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock somewhere\u201d took root right here in Austin.\n\nRevelry aside, CES and SXSW mean business, and while there are dozens of similarities between the two, there are numerous differences as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\n\nWhile the Vegas event features educational sessions, keynote speeches and seminars, CES is primarily a technology and innovation trade show \u2013 the largest trade show, in fact, in North America.\n\nIf CES is all about technology, SXSW is truly all things to all people.\n\nIn addition to the interactive festival, which runs now through Wednesday, March 11, SXSW also features individual f", "310": "This year\u2019s edition of annual music industry showcase SXSW kicks off in Austin, Texas this week and, while it\u2019s primarily about the next generation of bands and artists, there\u2019s loads of big names that\u2019ll be making the news. Here\u2019s 10 things that everyone\u2019s bound to be talking about between guzzling margaritas and chowing down on BBQ.\n\nUPDATE: Jay Z and Kanye West also will perform together at SXSW on Wednesday March 12\n\nColdplay preview new material\u2026\n\nRecently, Chris Martin\u2019s Coldplay dropped a surprise new track, \u2018Midnight\u2019. Produced by Jon Hopkins, it hints at a cooler, more electronic approach to their forthcoming new album, \u2018Ghost Stories\u2019, due for release on May 19. SXSW should be the first chance to hear more from that record; the band are playing an iTunes Festival gig out in Austin, which will be live-streamed across the world so even if you\u2019re not in Texas, you don\u2019t have to worry about missing out.\n\n\u2026 And so does Julian Casablancas\n\nLast week, The Strokes frontman shared a video teaser for his new solo album. It prompted a few questions for us and, come next Saturday (March 15), he should be answering at least one or two. His new backing band The Voidz will likely join him, revealing their identities, while it seems inevitable he\u2019ll play some fresh tracks in between material taken from his 2009 debut \u2018Phrazes For The Young\u2019.\n\nLady Gaga is this year\u2019s Keynote speaker\n\nDave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and the late Lou Reed have all taken a break from playing music to speak at SXSW and, this year, Lady Gaga will join that list. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll talk about yet but, as one of music\u2019s more eccentric characters, it\u2019s bound to be interesting. The night before, the singer will perform an intimate gig at the Stubb\u2019s venue.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jarvis Cocker will be on hand to help out songwriters\n\nThe Pulp frontman is one of the finest lyricists of modern British music and he\u2019ll be offering songwriting tips at a SXSW lecture on Wednesday, using his own lyrics to show his development as a musician, explaining the \u201cmeaning of artistic vision\u201d and giving advice to budding stars. Sounds like one lecture you\u2019ll want to take notes at.\n\nJungle will be a must-see band\n\nSure, we still don\u2019t know what Jungle actually look like (think the pictures you\u2019ve seen are actually them? Think again) but they\u2019re shaping up to be one of the most talked about bands of the festival if the rabid reaction to their recent shows in the UK is anything to go by. The whole enigmatic schtick might be a bit tiresome these days but when you\u2019ve got the tunes to back it up \u2013 just check out Jungle\u2019s latest single \u2018Busy Earnin\u2019- you can almost get away with it.

They played under the name at a secret show in Oakland, California last year and now they\u2019ve promised to do a two hour set at SXSW.

What better place to preview his new tracks? 50 Cent should have plenty of material to choose from too \u2013 he\u2019s also got another LP, \u2018Street King Immortal\u2019, done and dusted although he\u2019s yet to confirm any concrete details about that record.\n\nKelis\u2019 food truck\n\nAs well as playing a show at the festival, Kelis will be previewing her new album \u2018Food\u2019 by serving up dishes from her very own food truck during the event. On the menu, she\u2019s promising jerk ribs (obviously), duck confit sliders, shredded beef and wild cherry BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t look like milkshake\u2019s on the menu.Trick well and truly missed.\n\nFat White Family take their riotous live show to the US for the first time\n\nAnother band bound to be causing a stir at SXSW is Radar Award winners Fat White Family. They had to sell their services to get themselves over the Atlantic (they raised money via PledgeMusic, offering massages, meals and private gigs in return for cash) so expect them to make that hard work worthwhile.

This year it\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed,\u201d said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. \u201cI\u2019m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It\u2019s just, \u2018Sally, the engineer.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nBro-gramming Culture\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year\u2019s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named \u201cbreakout app\u201d in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry\u2019s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as \u201cbrogrammers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of that is the \u2018bro-gramming\u2019 and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,\u201d she said in an interview before her meeting. \u201cWhat women have to push really hard about is you don\u2019t have to be successful in a man\u2019s world \u2014 it\u2019s just the world.\u201d\n\nLook Harder\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference\u2019s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium\u2019s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n\u201cIf I had a dime for everybody who said that\u2019s a great rule but there just aren\u2019t enough qualified women I\u2019d be rich, rich, rich,\u201d he said. \u201cMy reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It\u2019s impossible for me to believe that you can\u2019t find a female speaker in the world who isn\u2019t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.\u201d\n\nMan\u2019s World\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women\u2019s issues this year was a March 7 talk \u201cStarting Up in a Man\u2019s World\u201d that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.\n\nThe lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.\n\nParsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.\n\nEllen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.\n\nC-Suite Women\n\nStill, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book \u201cLean In\u201d to inspire other females.\n\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers \u2014 like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,\u201d she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. \u201cThey have the ideas, but they don\u2019t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.\u201d", "312": "It\u2019s busy here in Austin . Thirty thousand delegates have come together for SXSW Interactive 2014, and the breadth of sessions, topics and speakers is vast. In just one hour, Eric Schmidt will talk about the new digital age, alongside sessions about content and commerce, crowd-funded start-ups and music for video game marketing.\n\nIt\u2019s inspiring but also a bit of a sensory overload, as sessions about the \u2018big\u2019 trends in technology (e.g. crypto currencies, robots, genetics or connected objects) rub up against topics that marketers and agencies are grappling with now (e.g. retail, content, mobile).\n\nSo, what, as a marketing community, should we take away from SXSW and put into practice? What ideas, themes, trends or technologies should we invest our time in? Here\u2019s my take on how approach and prioritise the key areas I\u2019ve seen emerge from SXSW Interactive this year:\n\n1 - Now\n\nThere are four topics I\u2019ve seen across the schedule at SXSW this year which we are all grappling with now: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing. Perhaps surprisingly, the conversation around these topics has not focused on the new and shiny, but on how to approach them in more mature ways.\n\nThere are four topics Iwhich we are all grappling with: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing.\n\nFor example, as the \u2018mobile majority\u2019 becomes a reality, Richard Ting of R/GA put forward a more strategic view of mobile marketing: not mobile screens as spaces for advertising, but planning for mobile to enhance product and user experiences, of which ads may be one part. This requires building mobile services and assets over the long-term (such as the excellent Nike Tricktree), not necessarily one-off \u2018campaign hits\u2019 for the sake of ticking a mobile box.\n\nContent and real-time marketing have been two of the most prolific topics here at SXSW. And the key questions are being tackled: should every brand \u2018do\u2019 real-time marketing? What\u2019s the strategic value of content? A particularly highlight was Kristina Halvorson, of Brain Traffic, who accuses the marketing community of being \u2018drunk\u2019 on the buzz of agile and real-time content - the \"Oreo effect\".\n\nTo whoops of support, she called on brands and agencies to focus their content efforts on serving customers at their points of real need, and to have clearly defined content strategies that focus on making content that really counts, not chasing every new opportunity that arises.\n\nIn fact, putting customer experience first is a big theme across SXSW. On this count, the marketing community and the developer community have something in common: to remember that we\u2019re designing digital services for customers, not ourselves, and their needs are always paramount. Adobe\u2019s \u2018pipeline\u2019 development team revealed how they build new products, and at the heart of their process is one key principle: that the customer experience of any prototype defines success or failure. We need to put customers (and their behaviours) first, and the technology second.\n\n2 - Next: the near future\n\nYes, there are plenty of sessions about wearable technology. But there is one underlying, and more significant, trend here at SXSW that will play out over the next 2 years: what the Internet looks and feels like when it moves beyond phones, tablets and computers.\n\nWe are all familiar with responsive design. But in a session about next generation responsive, Sarah Rotman Epps of Forrester spoke compellingly about the need go beyond \u2018responsive\u2019 as a way to show webpages on 3 screens, to a new marketing design paradigm which cuts across any potential screen: digital signage, watches, in-car systems, connected TVs and others. When many more new screens are connected, design of marketing must be truly responsive: tailored to a customer need and the context they\u2019re using a particular device in.\n\nIn fact, contextual user experience is another recurring theme of SXSW 2014. Partly driven by data, partly by new connected \u2018 things\u2019, and partly of the ubiquity of Internet access, designing how services (and marketing) help users in a particularly context and moment of need, is going to be a big challenge moving forward. Cliff Kuang of Wired sums it up by calling for \u2018more context, less complexity\u2019. By understand what people are doing on their devices at any point in time or place, we should tailor brand experiences that make life a little easier for them.\n\n3 - Beyond: new waves of disruption\n\nStaring into the distant future here at SXSW is exciting, and a little bit scary. The most fundamental trend I have seen is how technology reshapes manufacturing and our expectations of what products are. Ideo and Joi Ito of MIT Media Labs painted a picture of this potential new reality, where already in places like Shenzen, product designers are effectively \u2018A/B testing\u2019 physical products at scale by using advanced production and 3D-printing techniques.\n\nThey predict that everyday products will be embedded with sensors, such that almost anything, including our clothes, may respond to our emotional need-states. This points towards a future where mass customisation of products becomes a reality - where we expect the things we buy and use to respond to us. At this point, marketing really does meet user experience design.\n\nThere is one common thread I have seen that cuts across the now, next and beyond of SXSW: whether its content, context or customisation, the place is to start is with the needs of customers (and users) and build messages, experiences and products that improve their lives, even if just a little bit.", "313": "A GROUP of pop and rock bands and two movies from Scotland are to appear this week at one of the world's most influential cultural festivals in the US.\n\nMeursault, Young Fathers, Prides, Withered Hand, Honeyblood, Casual Sex and Holy Esque will be at the South by South West (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, as well as the films God Help the Girl and For Those in Peril.\n\nA special event, Showcasing Scotland, backed by the nation's art body, Creative Scotland, and the Association of Independent Music will take place on Friday.\n\nGod Help the Girl and For Those In Peril will screen as part of The SXSW Film Conference & Festival.\n\nPaul Wright, the director of For Those in Peril, said: \"It's really exciting for us all to be part of this year's SXSW festival.

National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House is a bona fide classic, while the likes of Revenge of the Nerds, Van Wilder and Old School all have their fair share of laughs.\n\nAnd Neighbors (or Bad Neighbours as it\u2019s called in the UK) may be the best of the bunch. It helps that the film has a pretty great comedy pedigree, being directed by Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek helmer Nick Stoller and starring the likes of Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. And true to form, the jokes come thick and fast, with very few failing to hit the mark.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nRogen plays Mac Radner, who moves to suburbia with his wife and new-born baby in an effort to embrace the quiet life. The most exciting Mac\u2019s day now gets is having sex in a room other than the bedroom, but he\u2019s happy with his lot in life. And wouldn\u2019t you be if your wife looked like Rose Byrne?\n\nAll that changes when a fraternity moves in next door however. Initially shocked, Mac and his missus Kelly decide that their best tactic is to welcome the youngsters with open arms. And so they launch a charm offensive, stopping by to say hi, and even offering them a joint in an effort to be cool and neighborly.\n\nAnd initially things go well, with frat head Teddy (Zac Efron) bonding with Mac and flirting with Kelly. But the honeymoon period is brief, with Delta Psi\u2019s parties becoming increasingly loud and raucous, so much so that the couple are forced to call the police. And that\u2019s when the real fun begins.\n\nAs war is declared, the frat boys endeavoring to ruin life for the couple and Mac and Kelly giving as good as they get.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nIt starts with simple pranks, the lads making a mess on the couple\u2019s lawn, the retaliation involving Kelly stirring things up between the brothers at one of their parties. But the battle quickly escalates, with proceedings turning both nasty and hilarious, most notably during Delta\u2019s insane end of year blow-out.\n\nEfron excels as the douchebag daddy of the frat, all cocksure arrogance in the film\u2019s early scenes before becoming increasingly insecure as proceedings progress. Indeed you\u2019re never quit sure exactly where he's coming from throughout the film, which is a testament to Efron\u2019s talents and makes Teddy the film\u2019s most interesting character.\n\nSeth Rogen is as good as ever as Mac, his inherent likeability ensuring you root for the character in spite of his stupidity. And Rose Byrne is something of a revelation as Kelly, with many of the film\u2019s best moments revolving around the nasty plans that she concocts.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nDave Franco, Chritopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael also bring the laughs as frat-boy fools, while Submarine star Craig Roberts delivers a wicked turn as a pledge who is simply referred to as Ass-Juice.\n\nAll of which makes for a very silly film that that has little in the way of depth or substance, but enough jokes to ensure that such superficiality doesn't really matter.", "322": "Zac Efron wouldn't mind reliving his East High School glory days.\n\nThe \"That Awkward Moment\" actor recently said he that would be \"100 percent\" interested in joining the cast of a potential \"High School Musical\" reunion film.\n\nWhile promoting his new raunchy comedy \"Neighbors\" on Sunday at this year's South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, the 26-year-old actor told E!

To me, they both had potential. The trailers did their job. I was excited for the movies. Then I actually saw That Awkward Moment, and \u201cexcited\u201d is about the last thing I felt. Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn\u2019t think he was great in Moment).\n\nThat\u2019ll teach me to whimsically equate unrelated productions.\n\nTo a sold out crowd, Neighbors made its premier Saturday night at SXSW, and it wouldn\u2019t be much of an exaggeration to say it had us literally rolling in the aisles. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say this is one of the funniest and freshest R-comedies since The Hangover. Now if they can just avoid the impulse to serialize it to death.\n\nThe story follows two threads: Seth Rogen and Rose Byre as a couple with a new baby trying to come to terms with the realities of responsible adulthood, and a frat cohort led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco trying to make fraternity history by doing something epic, something on the level of say, inventing beer pong\u2026and just maybe trying to cope with the impending conclusion of college as well. After burning a prior house down, the frat moves in next door to Teddy and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne), and through a series of events that I won\u2019t go into here (but are pretty damn funny to watch), the two households begin an epic feud.\n\nIf that all sounds a little crazy, it\u2019s because it is. But the movie absolutely nails the tone it\u2019s trying for, consistently asking the audience not to suspend their disbelief entirely, but only to push the bounds of believable out a little ways. It\u2019s what allows the movie to isolate Teddy and Kelly from the rest of the neighborhood by saying the frat bought out the rest of the block, but Teddy and Kelly can\u2019t move because, being next to a frat, their home value has now plummeted. This is where the real fun of the movie is found. It gives itself license to do just about anything, but restrains itself just enough that the audience isn\u2019t pulled in too many directions. It\u2019s a lot like The Hangover, actually, by way of Home Alone. You want to believe all the craziness these characters do, and so it flies.\n\n\n\nA big part of that is the way the characters themselves are drawn. As the old adage goes, keep it simple, stupid, and although I never thought I\u2019d celebrate character arcs so skinny they\u2019re practically anorexic, it\u2019s exactly that this movie calls for. What sets it apart is that is that it doesn\u2019t forsake its characters. Rogen is the formerly partying everyman he plays so well, taken to a new high here when he\u2019s forced to couple that with actual responsibility for a wife and child. Byrne\u2019s Kelly is a woman struggling to stay sane while staying home all day. Efron is the king who knows his reign must end. And Franco is the sidekick who points him the way. There\u2019s not very much, but the way little bits of personality are sprinkled throughout the film contributes the grounding that the picture has. But those are also easy character arcs to complete. The most heavy-handed it gets is Efron confronting his own college mortality, and even that gets broken up by an amazing series of bros before hoes jokes.\n\nBecause really, that\u2019s what we want from this movie \u2013 jokes \u2013 and thank goodness the script and the actors are good enough to give us an abundance of hilarity. Rogen, of course, is a known comic quantity, but Efron proves very capable and Franco fits his sidekick role well, although it does seem like some of the awkwardness of his character is less acting and more pure awkwardness. Byrne gets a chance to leave behind the stuck up nature of her character in Bridesmaids, and absolutely owns it as the desperate-for-a-party Kelly. And finally, a discussion of the cast cannot conclude without mentioning the sublime comic supporting turn of Ike Bairnholtz as Teddy\u2019s friend from work, as well as an all-too-brief performance from Lisa Kudrow.\n\nThe Verdict: 4 out of 5\n\nThis review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that\u2019s because there\u2019s a very limited amount to say. This movie knows what it is: an R-comedy the vein of Knocked Up, Superbad, The Hangover, etc., but it\u2019s smart enough to remain engaging and well executed to a high degree. My patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it\u2019s doing. It doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome, it\u2019s hilarious throughout, and it has all the character development it needs without an ounce more. Your enjoyment of this film is going to be entirely contingent on your enjoyment of others of its kind, as it is directly out of the Apatow circle of influence, but rest assured \u2013 this is among the better films this subgenre has to offer.\n\nFor more on Neighbors, check out our impressions from the SXSW World Debut.", "328": "Basking at the premiere of his new movie and smiling and waving at the screaming fans who shivered in the rain to catch a glimpse, Zac Efron was having a good night in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"I've been blessed to have the opportunities I've had,\" Efron told the audience Saturday at the premiere of Neighbors, which hits theaters May 9, at SXSW. \"It couldn't have happened better.

It was at the Sunset Towers, I was 17 or 18, I idolized him at this point. I stopped him and told him, 'Seth, I have to tell you I'm a huge fan.' \"\n\n\"I thought you were too young to see my movies,\" Rogen said. \"Did your mom take you?\"\n\nAs for the hard-partying character, Teddy, that Efron plays in the film, he said, \"I knew this guy. He's crazy. I was excited to play him.\"\n\n\"Zac was super funny,\" said director Nick Stoller. \"For the fraternity, we wanted everyone to have a comic energy that was different from one another but still meshed.\"\n\nAfter the movie, Efron promised the audience, \"We will take it back to college tonight,\" at the movie's after party, at the Lustre Pearl bar, decked out with beer cans and pizza boxes to look like a frat house.

Over the weekend, a reporter for E! asked the actor if he would ever return to the sacred (?) halls of East High \u2014 home of Disney\u2019s High School Musical franchise. And instead of shooting down the rumors, Efron replied, \u201cWe\u2019re all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do\u2026there\u2019s just this look between us.\u201d\n\nRight off the bat, I\u2019ll acknowledge that while this isn\u2019t a \u201cno,\u201d it\u2019s also not confirmation of a reunion. But also: At this point, would a reunion be the worst idea? It\u2019s not exactly surprising that Efron may be in, even though a year or two ago he wanted to graduate from East High for good. (UPDATE: When EW asked Disney Channel for a response to Efron\u2019s comments, they sent this statement: \u201cEveryone at Disney Channel takes pride in knowing that our wonderful \u2018High School Musical\u2019 cast has fond memories about their days as \u2018Wildcats,\u2019 and that each year, new audiences are introduced to the movies through our telecasts around the world, but we have no \u2018new news\u2019 to report.\u201d)\n\nIf Efron did decide to return and give us \u201cScream Pt. 2,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see the rest of the cast following suit. They wouldn\u2019t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV. (And no, I\u2019m not talking about SNL\u2018s High School Musical: New Senior Class.) The movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High. (Real talk: What was Troy and Gabrielle\u2019s love if not a millennial, significantly less high-stakes version of Maria and Tony?) The project keeps getting pushed back, but it hasn\u2019t been canceled \u2014 Disney just put out Teen Beach Movie instead. But what if it got revved up again \u2014 and the original HSM gang came back for a little alumni number? (Efron has long said he would consider doing something like that.)\n\nA return from the original six could give HSM4 enough buzz for the movie to get off the ground. After all, Efron \u2014 while clearly the star of the bunch \u2014 has seen his last couple projects disappoint (RIP, That Awkward Moment). And while he\u2019ll still have no trouble booking future films, it could be in Efron\u2019s best interest to remind people why they love him in the first place.

It just seemed like whenever we felt like it-no hesitation,\" adding, \"It was like wake up, work out and then go to set and party all day.\"\n\nIn \"Neighbors\" Zac Efron stars alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who play a young couple with a baby that get new neighbors who just happen to be a rowdy fraternity house.\n\nThe \"That Awkward Moment\" actor plays the fraternity president leading the group of trouble-making frat brothers that consist of Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael.\n\nWhile on set Lily Collins' ex-boyfriend, Zac Efron made sure that he stayed fit and decided to workout between scenes. The actor even found a spot on set where he thought no one could see him doing a \"ton of pushups.\" However, someone was watching him.\n\nThe \"Parkland\" actor revealed some details about the old man, \"He goes, 'Steve McQueen used to do that,'\" adding, \"He just looked like he had a lot of wisdom and I was like, 'Really, Steve McQueen did that?' He's like, ''Yeah, I saw him do that,' and then he goes, 'Don't do too many because you'll get sweaty.'\"\n\nAnother interesting experience on set was Seth Rogen's shared shirtless scenes with Efron. The comedian described standing next to the young star.\n\nHe confessed, \"It was brutal,\" adding, \"I was just telling my wife there are a few scenes where he had his shirt off and people make a noise I've never heard before when they see him. It's crazy. It's a weird noise.\"\n\nZac Efron got his big break in the hit Disney movie \"High School Musical\" alongside ex-girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nThe actor mentioned that the cast has been considering a reunion. He admitted, \"We're all thinking about it,\" adding, \"I continue to see all the guys from High School.\"\n\nThe star continued, \"Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.\"\n\nAre you excited to see Zac Efron shirtless in \"Neighbors?\" Let us know in the comment section below.", "335": "Zac Efron is ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie.\n\nThe 26-year-old actor was catapulted to the spotlight in 2006's hit film where he played popular student and captain of the varsity basketball team, Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.\n\nThe hunk claims he still meets up with his former co-stars, who've never forgotten the experience they shared, and insists their reunions take them back to the days when they worked together.\n\nHe told E!

It brings you right back to those days.''\n\nEfron will next hit the big screen in comedy 'Neighbors', where he plays the president of a fraternity, alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who have been cast as a married couple.\n\nHe added: ''It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.\n\n''For us, we really had a fraternity. We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.''", "336": "Seth Rogen\u2019s being a grown-up again. Fear not, those who remember Ro-Bro\u2019s crying scene in Take This Waltz \u2013 this time the relationship stuff is played way down in the dirt. Bad Neighbours \u2013 writer-director Nicholas Stoller\u2019s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller \u2013 has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment. Instead it crashes Project X into a Joe Swanberg movie, invites it to chug the drinks and throw up all over the rug.\n\nRogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door. Head of the frat pack is Zac Efron as Teddy, a sweet-natured lunk who doesn\u2019t want to keep the couple\u2019s baby awake, but can\u2019t pass up an opportunity to party.\n\nStoller \u2013 the long-term Apatow collaborator who also had a hand in 2011\u2019s Muppets revamp \u2013 has always been good at mixing profanity and pathos. His directorial debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, hid a sincere romantic drama behind all the dick jokes. Neighbors is far less subtle, barely bothering to check if its dignity\u2019s in place before leaping into the next filthy setup.\n\nRogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the thirtysomethings anxious to do right by their daughter, look cool in front of the kids and still get invited to party like they used to. Byrne\u2019s role is meatier than most comedies \u2013 even Apatow comedies \u2013 allow their female stars. Kelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic. They\u2019re a very likable couple, both as tempted by the hard partying lifestyle of Teddy and co as they are dismissive of it.\n\nEfron is strangely blank for the alpha-male leader of a group of marauding teens, but his support \u2013 including Dave Franco as his big-brained lieutenant, Pete, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as \u201cblessed\u201d numbskull Scoonie \u2013 pick up the slack. Submarine\u2019s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member. He\u2019s full of conflicted emotions about his place in the all-male society, unsure how the house\u2019s intensely homo-social heirarchy chimes with his need for independence. His character is called Assjuice.\n\n\n\nBad Neighbours needs a tuck. The pacing is wobbly, the targets are too big. There are some lazy gags about post-natal sex (\u201cshe\u2019s got these huge tits, but she insists on wearing a wife-beater. It\u2019s like fucking Tony Soprano!\u201d) and too much focus on Scoonie\u2019s schlong. But it\u2019s also an extremely funny comedy that pushes Rogen\u2019s instinctive good nature to the limit. His stoner schtick helps to take the edge off much of the film\u2019s crassness and gives it back some charm.\n\n\u2022 This review was first published to coincide with the SXSW premiere of Bad Neighbours", "337": "For those who care about films in the slightest, South by Southwest is the place to be this week. The conference, which runs March 7th through March 16th in Austin, Texas, is the place for enthusiasts to see the latest films, get album previews and generally have tons of fun. So, four days into SXSW, what are the highlights?\n\n\n\nThe VM cast was out in full force at SXSW.\n\nFirst of all, there was Seth Rogen and Zac Efron\u2019s Neighbors, which pits Rogen against Efron in a battle for dominance over a suburban street. In this comedy, directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O\u2019Brien, Rogen plays one half of a newly married couple, who are just settling into their cozy suburban nest. Efron and his band of frat boys, however, are there to ruin everything. According to THR, Neighbors got big laughs at its Paramount Theater premiere, so it might be one to look out for later in the year.\n\nWatch the Red Band trailer below.\n\n\n\nFor more highlights, click through to the next page.", "338": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - It\u2019s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.\n\nAs a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, \u201cNeighbors,\u201d that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.\n\nPacked with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes - including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump - the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.\n\nBut as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film\u2019s biggest battle turns out to be internal.\n\nIt is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to \u201cget-off-my-lawn\u201d adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a kid, that\u2019s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,\u201d Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie\u2019s first public screening. \u201cThat\u2019s probably good in some ways, but it\u2019s also a bummer in some ways.\u201d\n\nEarly reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie\u2019s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as \u201clewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid\u201d than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9.\n\nThe audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.\n\nMac and Kelly\u2019s frantic debate over how to say \u201ckeep it down\u201d in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?\n\n\u2018I KNOW THESE GUYS\u2019\n\nThe inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O\u2019Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own fans.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,\u201d Rogen said with a laugh. \u201cThat to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that\u2019s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.\u201d\n\nByrne\u2019s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the \u201cBridesmaids\u201d actress.\n\nKelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy\u2019s girlfriend to betray him.\n\nEfron, characterized by Variety\u2019s Barker as giving \u201cone of his most credible and intriguing performances\u201d as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.\n\nWhere Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron said.\n\nHe credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy\u2019s multi-faceted character.\n\n\u201cWe were able to kind of find the heart in it,\u201d Efron, 26, said. \u201cI have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I\u2019ve felt those feelings.\u201d\n\nIt is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up.", "339": "Don\u2019t call Zac Efron a Disney star anymore.\n\nIn \u201cNeighbors,\u201d an irreverent comedy directed by Nick Stoller, Efron continues his transition from teen idol to mature actor \u2014 with a big push from Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Efron plays Rogen\u2019s neighbor, the president of a fraternity hellbent on making history by throwing the greatest party his college town has ever seen. He\u2019s more than a just Rogen\u2019s co-star, he\u2019s the comedic foil to Rogen, one of the most successful comedy writers and actors of the past decade.\n\nAlso read: Shirtless Zac Efron, Seth Rogen Tease \u2018Bound 4\u2019 Parody (Photo)\n\n\u201cThese actors that grow up through the Disney system have insane chops,\u201d Stoller told TheWrap Saturday. \u201c[Zac\u2019s] very funny and knows what makes him funny.

Though Rogen taunted a few members of the crowd, labeling one \u201cself-serving,\u201d Stoller deemed the festival \u201cthe best place to play a movie.\u201d He was in Austin six years ago with the crowd-pleasing \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall,\u201d his directorial debut. That movie, which features a naked Jason Segel in an early scene, is tame compared to \u201cNeighbors.\u201d Rogen and Byrne play a married couple horrified by the arrival of a frat next door. Yet neither is ready to grow up \u2014 as in so many recent comedies \u2014 so they get caught up trying to fight their new enemy with juvenile hijinks.\n\nThe story was born when Brendan O\u2019Brien\u2019s wife described some youths in the neighborhood by telling a cop \u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 know what they\u2019re doing, but they\u2019re up to no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe became old at that moment,\u201d O\u2019Brien, who co-wrote the movie with Andrew Jay Cohen, told the crowd.\n\nSee photos: 15 Gotta-See SXSW Movies: Zac Efron Bros Out and Jeremy Sisto Balls Out\n\nThe movie takes this concept to the extreme. During a friendly night of partying at the neighboring frat house, Rogen takes mushrooms and \u201ccrosses streams\u201d with Efron \u2014 a bonding mechanism of sorts. Yet the relationship deteriorates from there as Efron and his buddies, including Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, exact retribution after Rogen and Byrne call the cops about a party. When Rogen retaliates by flooding the frat house with water, Efron devises a scheme to save it by having his brothers craft dildos from their own members and sell them. They get a hot tub out if it. All of these shenanigans are still tamer than the final party, which Stoller said was designed to be the \u201ccraziest party you\u2019ve ever been at.\u201d\n\nSee video: SXSW: Watch Live Interviews With Seth Rogen, Robert Duvall, Emmy Rossum, Paul Wesley, Kathryn Hahn and More\n\nThe writer-director learned a lot about shooting party scenes from \u201cGet Him to the Greek,\u201d his follow-up to \u201cSarah Marshall\u201d starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. \u201cNeighbors\u201d features numerous memorable performances from comedy mainstays Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Franco, among others, but the two standouts are Byrne and Efron. Byrne plays a woman every bit as ferocious as her husband, defying the comedic trope of the controlling, bleating wife. She rejects Rogen when he tries to tell her she\u2019s supposed to keep him in check. She even facilitates a fraternal betrayal by feeding shots to Efron\u2019s girlfriend and Franco \u2014 and then kissing both of them. The next morning Rogen is obligated to milk Byrne\u2019s inflated breasts.\n\n\u201cIt was important to her that this character not be a nag in any way,\u201d Stoller told TheWrap. \u201cUsually the woman in these movies is not that fun. My movies have gone away from that. I\u2019ve made the female characters as funny as the guys.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Can Naked Zac Efron and \u2018That Awkward Moment\u2019 Revive Rom-Coms for the Sexting Age?\n\nAs for Efron, he\u2019s been on a mission to erase the Disney stigma and demonstrate his versatility, whether by flirting with Nicole Kidman in \u201cThe Paperboy\u201d or palling around with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan in \u201cThat Awkward Moment.\u201d Kidman already peed on him in \u201cThe Paperboy,\u201d but \u201cNeighbors\u201d takes the raunch to a new level. When an audience member asked him about the transition from Disney star to comedic foil, he gave the following reply, \u201cWhen you get a call from Seth Rogen, you\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d\n\nPictured below: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Dave Franco at SXSW premiere of \u201cNeighbors\u201d", "340": "Based on the merits of being a \u201cHow To\u201d guide for aspiring parents, Neighbors is a one star movie about two adults selfishly putting their own insecurities before the well-being of their newborn baby. We\u2019re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible. Wildly inappropriate, of course, but with Nicholas Stoller\u2019s outlandish direction, Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O\u2019Brien watch their screenplay turn into a riotous Greek life comedy that\u2019ll make you question every responsible decision you made throughout your college career. Stoller himself admitted that only one member of his production team actually lived a fraternity life in college, so you can imagine the generalizations and stereotypes blown wildly out of proportion, but it\u2019s all in the name of comedy \u2013 and the most epic rager that frat life could possibly imagine.\n\nMac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are new parents enjoying their more modest suburban lifestyle, embracing early nights and child care instead of raves and late night diner trips. Their life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA \u2013 until a fraternity moves in next door. Led by President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his Vice President Pete (Dave Franco), this is your Animal House style fraternity with the dial cranked even higher, as it\u2019s Teddy\u2019s mission to earn his rightful place on the frat\u2019s Hall of Fame board, along with the supposed inventors of the Toga Party and every college kid\u2019s best friend, the Boot and Rally. This doesn\u2019t bode well for the Radner\u2019s humble lifestyle, so they decide to fight back. Can Mac and Kelly party hard enough to infiltrate the frat and get them evicted? If there\u2019s one brotherhood you should avoid starting a war with, it\u2019s an immature, vengeful frat \u2013 something that the Radners are about to find out.\n\nGraduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders. Efron has never been funnier, and getting away from his \u201cgood guy\u201d persona creates a completely embellished caricature that\u2019s entirely too much fun to ignore, pairing nicely with his second-in-command played by Dave Franco \u2013 another young actor who pops his collar and leaves us in stitches. The chemistry between these two is highlighted by a scene I can only dream was improvised on set, recording Teddy and Pete\u2019s genius reinventions of the phrase \u201cbros before hos\u201d \u2013 only to have Pete heartbroken later when Teddy doesn\u2019t acknowledge the \u201cbropology\u201d that took place, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT RHYMED! Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael round out our alpha dogs, one a certifiable porn star and the other a hopeless pothead, but it\u2019s Teddy and Pete who ultimately win us over through wicked epicness \u2013 that\u2019s what the kids say these days, right?\n\nAs for Rogen and Byrne \u2013 where do I start? Again, for any aspiring parents at home, you\u2019ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily. The Radners leave their child at home for an entire night full of fraternity partying, and get sufficiently intoxicated, but everything is alright because Rose has her baby monitor. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME \u2013 but please witness the utter hilarity that our bored couple creates.\n\nNeighbors is essentially pornography for adults who fantasize about reliving their glory years, now unable to slug Jager and take two story bong rips, as those viewers can live vicariously through Rogen and Byrne \u2013 a comedic dream couple. Whether it\u2019s Rogen dancing his ass off while wearing a goofy gansta\u2019 hat or Byrne turning from innocent housewife into manipulative female she-demon, these two talents riff off one another with perfect comedic ease, again aiding Stoller\u2019s admittedly overplayed mentality. Oh, and Byrne \u2013 please stick to only horror and comedy from here on out. Please?!\n\nAs for the party-hearty shenanigans throughout Neighbors, Stoller and company create every college boy\u2019s fantasy while also somehow addressing fears that come along with leaving college \u2013 albeit nothing but surface recognition. You\u2019re here to laugh, and watching Rogen attempt to keep up with Efron delivers \u201cfirst pot brownie\u201d hilarity. Blacklights, kegs, drugs, sorority girls, bro bonding, tank tops, Robert De Niro themed parties \u2013 Neighbors goes for broke and succeeds in creating one of the funniest fraternal comedies since Animal House \u2013 the Holy Grail of college humor. Stoller\u2019s complete disregard for reality is his greatest weapon, subduing audiences with masculine hugs and spot on sight gags that again live in some fantasy world where airbags can hide in chairs, launching unknowing victims into crumbly tile ceilings. Nothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy\u2019s \u2013 and then you\u2019ll just want to pull an Old School.\n\nNeighbors is like walking into a frat party and witnessing a game of beer pong between Willie Nelson, Kenny Powers, and the Coors Light commercial twins \u2013 it\u2019s probably just a hallucinogenic tease brought on by some \u201cparty favors\u201d you popped earlier, but for the time being, it\u2019s nothing but pure, entertaining bliss. Attacking \u201cbro\u201d culture with the energy of a \u2018roided out grizzly bear, Stoller pushes comedy farther than he\u2019s ever attempted, an easy achievement with such a star-studded comedic cast. Efron is a pastel plastered revelation, and has honestly never been funnier \u2013 the same goes for Byrne, minus the abs and plus a maternal surprise. Sure, there\u2019s a paper-thin story that doesn\u2019t really strike the serious notes of maturing, growing older, and accepting a more \u201cnormal\u201d life \u2013 but with non-stop laughs and gut-busting highlights, Neighbors is a death cup victory on Team Stoller\u2019s first pong shots.", "341": "\"Who here is a little bit drunk?\"\n\nAnd to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night's Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause. And we're talking upwards of 1,000 rowdy cinephiles, too, being that Neighbors was unveiled at Austin's Paramount Theatre, a 1,100-seat venue that resembles one of those old-school opera houses, complete with side balconies and an upper seating level.\n\nThe man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie's first-ever screening. Stoller's back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek. Where Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast. Foul-mouthed, kinetic, and lean (clocking in at a just-right 95 minutes), it's consistently hilarious\u2014come May 9, when Neighbors officially opens theatrically, it will be the funniest movie a major Hollywood studio (in this case, Universal Pictures) will have released since 2012's Jump Street.\n\nThere was hardly a quiet moment throughout the screening, due in large part to the film's loaded cast, all of whom are on the entire time. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac and Kelly Rdner, a happily married couple trying to keep the flame going despite the fact that they're raising an infant girl, Stella (a natural born scene-stealer if there ever was one). To complicate their domestic life, Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity made up of mostly dim-witted meatheads, moves into the house next door, turning Teddy and Kelly's neighborhood into a 24/7 reenactment of National Lampoon's Animal House. Led by president Teddy (Zac Efron) and his VP, Pete (Dave Franco), the frat dudes go to the extremes of partying\u2014at one point, they turn their entire home into a \"hotbox house,\" which, yes, is close what it sounds like, only much more set-design ambitious. It doesn't help Mac's situation that Teddy's beyond ripped, with arms that, as Mac puts it, look like \"two big veiny dicks.\"\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNeighbors is, for the most part, a tightly connected series of sight gags and profane one-liners, but unlike most Hollywood comedies, very few of the film's jokes miss. It'd be too obvious to single out Rogen's performance, even though he hasn't been this funny on-screen since Knocked Up. An ensemble piece, Neighbors features two unexpected MVP performances from Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. Franco, playing off of the similarly impressive against-type Efron, gets just as many strong punch-lines as Rogen, while Byrne never lets the dominant comedic force who's playing her fictional other-half overshadow her. In fact, she got the premiere's biggest round of applause, coming after a set-piece in which Mac and Kelly strategically turn Teddy and Pete against each other by challenging the old \"bros before hoes\" conceit.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nByrne's big moment happens in the midst of one of the film's many frat house raves, all of which radiate with flashing neon lights, energetic handheld camerawork, and unruly close-ups and camera angles. During the post-screening Q&A, for which the entire cast minus Rose Byrne participated, Stoller cited the 2009 French head-trip film Enter the Void as a \"visual touchstone\" used by he and director of photography Brandon Trost for the Neighbors party scenes, and it shows.\n\nNot that Stoller or any of his cast were able to bring any personal experiences to those sequences, though. While introducing the film, Stoller dedicated it to producer James Weaver, the only person involved with Neighbors who was ever in a fraternity. \"The rest of us,\" said Stoller, \"were Jews and child stars. Thank you, James, for explaining to me what an elephant walk is.\"\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOnce the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast. Unsurprisingly, that's when Seth Rogen took over the proceedings. The first question came from one rather enthusiastic audience member, a guy who stepped into one of the aisles to make sure Rogen and company could clearly see him. \"That was one of the best movies I've ever seen,\" he said, spending a solid 60 seconds repeating that sentiment with different phrasings. At his final \"best movie ever\" exclamation, Rogen didn't waste a second. \"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of that guy! The second this is over!\"\n\nThe only time one of Rogen's responses earned a larger outburst of clapping than that? When another audience member cited a bit in Neighbors where Rogen and Efron's characters, both excessively drunk and high, discuss their personal favorite Batmans\u2014the older Mac prefers Michael Keaton and the much younger Teddy likes Christian Bale. The question for Rogen was, simply, \"Who's Batman to you?\" Showing love to Keaton, he asked the crowd, \"Who here like the George Clooney Batman? Absolutely no one.\"\n\nThe Q&A as a whole, not unlike Neighbors itself, maintained that kind of random humor. Barely any of the audience's questions pertained directly to the movie.

Last year, nearly 75,000 people converged on Austin for the film festival, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nKeeping it low-key: Things were a lot quieter when the heartthrob left Los Angeles International Airport\n\n", "343": "Lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid than anything its director Nicholas Stoller and star Seth Rogen have ever been involved with before, frat comedy \u201cNeighbors\u201d boasts an almost oppressive volume of outrageous gags, and provided that audiences don\u2019t mind the lack of anything resembling a coherent story arc, its commercial potential ought to be enormous. Presented as a work-in-progress at SXSW (though aside from missing credits and a few continuity quirks, it appears largely finished), \u201cNeighbors\u201d is an unchecked riot that should go a long way toward selling antagonist Zac Efron as a credible adult actor, though as with anything involving the Greek system, a bit more moderation from the start might have prevented a few headaches afterward.\n\nRogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, a young married couple whose infant daughter has prompted a move into the suburbs. Aside from the disruption to their sex and social lives \u2014 their efforts to organize \u201cbaby\u2019s first rave\u201d notwithstanding \u2014 the couple seem to be managing the transition to parenthood well, until the property next door is taken over by the Delta Psi Beta fraternity, led by peacocking president Teddy (Efron) and his brainy, just barely sublimated love interest, Pete (Dave Franco).\n\nThe frat\u2019s arrival forces Mac and Kelly to confront their own accelerating decline into old fogeydom, as they frantically debate the least-uncool way to deliver the phrase \u201ccould you keep it down?\u201d to their new neighbors. The two parties extend some initial olive branches, with Teddy inviting the couple over for some magic mushrooms and Mac strenuously attempting to use the word \u201ctrill\u201d in conversation, but when Mac and Kelly finally call the cops on one of the frat\u2019s weeknight ragers, the two houses declare all-out war.\n\nWhile the film\u2019s first 15 or so minutes bear a notable resemblance to Stoller\u2019s shaggier, more amiable previous efforts like \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d and \u201cThe Five-Year Engagement,\u201d at this point the director allows chaos to reign supreme, with the pic quickly turning into \u201cRevenge of the Nerds\u201d by way of \u201cSpring Breakers.\u201d Mac and Kelly\u2019s meeting with the university dean (Lisa Kudrow) reveals that the frat has only two disciplinary strikes left before it will be disbanded, and the couple instigates an elaborate campaign of sabotage, with Delta house responding in kind.\n\nThere\u2019s little here that makes much sense from a narrative standpoint \u2014 indeed, Rogen\u2019s 2013 hit, \u201cThis Is the End,\u201d might as well be Bergman by comparison \u2014 yet only occasionally does it matter. Subplots involving Mac and Kelly\u2019s best buddy (Ike Barinholtz) appear to be missing key establishing scenes. At times the film abandons all pretense of sketching a real dramatic arc altogether, simply lining up one outlandish, frenzied setpiece after another. And at the end of the day, there\u2019s no real reason for Efron and Rogen to stage an epic kung fu battle using plaster casts of the Delta house members\u2019 members. But sticklers will be few and far between.\n\nRelegated to middling girlfriend roles for far too long, Byrne is here cast as the most foul-mouthed matriarch this side of \u201cAugust: Osage County,\u201d and she attacks the role with almost maniacal enthusiasm. But it\u2019s the eternally shirtless ex-teen idol Efron, surprisingly, who delivers the film\u2019s most intriguing performance, crafting a dime-turning combination of brotherly earnestness and Mephistophelean sadism that will ring true to anyone who ever found themselves on the losing end of a wooden paddle.\n\nIn some of the film\u2019s best scenes, particularly a hysterical coda outside an Abercrombie & Fitch store, Rogen and Efron\u2019s characters seem less nemeses than distorted reflections of one another. (On some level, Teddy seems to realize it\u2019s only a matter of years before he\u2019ll find himself on the other side of the fence, tormented by a jerk exactly like himself.) It might have been interesting to see a somewhat deeper, more Apatovian take on this theme, though \u201cdeeper\u201d is not a direction the film ever seems interested in navigating.\n\nThere are a number of missed marks, however. A gag about infant HIV really needs to be funnier than this one is to justify its existence, while a woefully pointless breast-pump fiasco sequence feels almost cynically engineered just to give the film a \u201cBridesmaids\u201d-style bodily function conversation-starter. (It may as well have been referred to in the script as \u201cthat scene.\u201d) It\u2019s an unnecessary but unsurprising move for a movie that values volume over consistency.\n\nTechnically speaking, the pic is much better shot and edited than a college comedy really needs to be, with the frequent party scenes in particular taking on an almost surrealistic timbre.", "344": "Comcast boosts digital store with Sony deal\n\n\n\n\n\nComcast is to sell Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (SPHE) titles through its Xfinity On Demand digital store.

In Hollywood terms, the arrangement might not be anything remarkable \u2013 just a new way of syndicating reruns. But cutting Netflix out of the picture for its signature show sends a clear signal that the entertainment and cable industries aren't about to let some Northern California tech company change television without exacting a price.\n\nThanks to the company's aggressive marketing, House of Cards is known as a Netflix show just as much as The Sopranos was an HBO show. But even the $100 million it reportedly spent didn't buy Netflix all the rights to Frank Underwood's Machiavellian rise. Apparently, that money gave Netflix only the exclusive right to stream two seasons online first, and it didn't even cover the total production costs of the first 26 episodes. The rest of the costs fell on Media Rights Capital, the independent studio that actually made House of Card, and it is free to sell other rights.\n\nTo make its money back, the studio has a deal with Sony to handle distribution of House of Cards internationally and for \"home video,\" a term that in the Netflix streaming-video era seems meaningless. In practice, it means Sony gets to sell House of Cards DVDs and other ways for couch surfers to pay a la carte for the show, such as on Amazon Instant Video. That appears to be the kind of agreement Comcast struck with Sony, which also lets the cable provider offer access to Sony movies such as American Hustle ahead of other video-on-demand services.\n\nFor Comcast, the movies seem like the meat of the deal, while the House of Cards arrangement is more about sending a message to Netflix and the general public. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services have encouraged the rise of \"cord-cutting,\" which threatens the cable business, and Comcast isn't taking this laying down. Recently, Comcast exercised its own leverage by getting Netflix to pay for more direct access to Comcast's network, and now, the cable giant to making another move with its House of Cards deal, showing that it can cannibalize Netflix's business right back.\n\nNot that a swarm of Comcast customers are about to go out and spend money to watch House of Cards somewhere other than Netflix \u2013 or at least they shouldn't. It's not clear how much Comcast plans to charge. But on Amazon, for instance, high-definition episodes are $2.99 a piece, or nearly $39 for the whole season. That's almost as much as five months of Netflix, which also includes season two, as well as Orange Is the New Black, another Netflix hit coming to Comcast soon. But just by making House of Cards an option, Comcast is eating into the brand identity Netflix is trying to establish for itself as the only place to watch \"its\" shows.\n\nOriginal programming has become crucial to Netflix's business model. By getting House of Cards, Comcast sends a subtle signal to Netflix non-subscribers that maybe they don't need to spend that extra eight dollars a month after all. They might not actually pay Comcast to watch House of Cards either, but just knowing they could get the show there might be enough. On the other hand, if anyone does watch the first season of House of Cards on cable, Netflix still has a powerful advantage: the siren song of season two.", "356": "Netflix and Comcast recently came to terms in a widely-reported deal, the fruits of which should become evident to consumers very soon.\n\nNetflix just released the figures for its monthly Internet Service Provider speed and performance update.

Netflix currently owns exclusive streaming rights to the Media Rights Capital-produced series, while Sony handles international and homevideo distribution.\n\nComcast\u2019s plan to sell \u201cHoC\u201d season 1 \u2014 at $1.99 per episode \u2014 seems perplexing, given Netflix\u2019s $7.99 per month price point. But it\u2019s interesting body language from the No. 1 MSO, given Netflix\u2019s desire to reach a deal to have its service embedded into Comcast set-tops. Meanwhile \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d first season has been available on other EST services, including Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Vudu, also priced at $1.99 per episode for SD and $2.99 each for HD.\n\nIn addition, Comcast will add select Sony titles to its early electronic sell-through service, which offers access ahead of the traditional VOD-rental window.

Cable operator touted early success of the EST service, noting it was the No. 1 digital sales partner for Universal\u2019s \u201cDespicable Me 2\u2033 for the week ended Dec. 3, according to the studio.\n\nWarner Bros. signed on as a partner for Comcast Xfinity Store two weeks ago, Smit added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprised us how well the product has done,\u201d Smit said. \u201cThe value of the product is the currency\u2026 It comes out before VOD, and you don\u2019t have to go to a laptop or a smartphone \u2014 you can order it right from your TV.\u201d\n\nComcast\u2019s launch of Xfinity Store follows Verizon\u2019s FiOS Flex View, which has offered movies for purchase and viewable on multiple devices since late 2010.\n\nComcast subs who buy a TV show or movie from their set-top box or from xfinity.com/store may watch the purchased titles in multiple ways: on TV through Xfinity On Demand; on a computer from the website; or with the Xfinity On Demand Purchases app for iOS and Android.\n\nComcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, had 21.7 million video subscribers as of the end of 2013. The MSO last month announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion, a deal currently undergoing regulatory review. Comcast expects to achieve $1.5 billion in synergies by absorbing TW Cable, with 50% of that in the first year.", "358": "Every month video streaming service Netflix trots out its results list for speed tests of US internet service providers, ranking each in descending order. There was a recent stir of controversy, as Comcast took a sudden nose-dive in the standings. This came, rather coincidentally, just before Netflix paid up for better service. In fairness, the deal was already in the works during the drop-off, so it was at best a negotiation tactic.\n\nWith that mess now in the rear-view mirror, Netflix announces it is expanding the list of ISPs that it plans to track and include on its monthly shame and fame list.\n\n\"We expanded the list to provide insight into the performance of many of the smaller providers in the US and to give credit where it is due. For example, Midcontinent, a regional cable provider in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, takes second place in the expanded rankings\", says Joris Evers of Netflix.\n\nThe service also took the opportunity to tweak its new cable partner just a bit, stating \"we do expect to see Comcast's performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data\".\n\nThe data is culled from more than 44 million Netflix customers worldwide, as the company also tracks ISPs in Mexico and The Netherlands, among other places. It's a bit of a wake-up-call for providers, as Neflix is calling out anyone who isn't living up to standards.\n\nImage Credit: Lisa S. / Shutterstock", "359": "After months of slowed-down data speeds for Netflix users on Comcast and Time Warner Cable\u2019s network, speeds rebounded the very same month that Netflix agreed to pay Comcast money for more direct access to its network.\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, generated from Netflix\u2019s monthly report, Comcast customers saw a dramatic turnaround in streaming speeds, going from about 1.5 Mbps to 1.7 Mbps.\n\nThough that is still far off from the 2.1 Mbps speeds Comcast users were seeing before their ISP\u2019s numbers started to tank, it is hopefully the beginning of an upward trend. Of course, there wasn\u2019t really much worse Comcast speeds could get.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the Netflix deal wasn\u2019t announced until late February, with only a few days left in the month. Had Comcast eased up on congested peering points in expectation of the agreement being finalized?\n\nLikewise, since no paid peering deal with Time Warner Cable has been announced, we have to wonder if the sudden improvement in TWC\u2019s speeds are tied to its proposed merger with Comcast. Granted, TWC\u2019s speed results have been so erratic that it\u2019s possible this uptick is just a matter of someone using the good duct tape to fix a loose connection somewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon FiOS speeds have sunk from being the best and steadiest of the three providers to substandard levels. Netflix is reportedly in talks with Verizon for a paid-peering deal of some sort, so those numbers will likely improve; it\u2019s just a question of when \u2014 and how bad Verizon will allow the connection to get before customers revolt.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, here is how these three providers look compared to Google Fiber, the fastest ISP on Netflix\u2019s charts:\n\n\n\nAnd here are the three providers compared to Google and a few other major ISPs:\n\n", "360": "While Netflix has spent the last several years dutifully trying to convince content providers to license TV shows and movies to the subscription video-on-demand service\u2014all while simultaneously developing its own original content to draw in viewers HBO-style\u2014now it looks as though the tables have turned.\n\nComcast subscribers will soon be able to watch House of Cards via their cable set-top box sans Netflix subscription. That\u2019s according to a report from Variety, which notes that Comcast made a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, thereby giving Comcast the rights to sell the series through its newly launched Xfinity Store.\n\nWhile Netflix owns exclusive streaming rights to House of Cards, Sony is in charge of international and home distribution.\n\nComcast also made a deal with Lionsgate that will give it rights to sell Netflix\u2019s other highly acclaimed original series Orange is the New Black in May.\n\nComcast has confirmed the report, but Netflix could not be reached for comment.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs. It\u2019s the digital equivalent of buying the DVD set when it hits the shelves months after the season airs. Non-Netflix users have been able to watch House of Cards since season one was released on DVD last June. It\u2019s also available in other digital stores, such as Amazon Instant Video, Walmart.com, and Verizon Fios.\n\nA Comcast spokesperson says that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store within the next 30 days, and that it will only be the first season of the show. The second season will presumably become available in the Xfinity Store some time around or after it\u2019s made available on DVD.\n\nPreviously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes. Those discussions were reportedly put on hold (as were Netflix\u2019s talks with Time Warner about the same thing) when Comcast acquired Time Warner for $45 billion. Meanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could \u201cout-Netflix Netflix.\u201d\n\nLast month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast\u2019s subscribers. Net neutrality rules are meant to ensure that all digital content companies receive equal access to bandwidth. The problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix\u2019s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization. Rather, Netflix is paying to deliver its content directly to consumers rather than going through middlemen, like Cogent Communications. Essentially, it\u2019s getting a direct route to Comcast Internet subscribers rather than driving on the same crowded freeway with all the other schmucks.", "361": "As expected, Netflix\u2019s deal with Comcast has produced a bump in speeds for the streaming video service.\n\nIn February, Netflix streaming speeds averaged 1.68 Mbps on Comcast, compared to 1.51 Mbps in February. It\u2019s not a huge leap, but it\u2019s the first sign of improvement after Netflix began paying Comcast for a direct connection late last month. Netflix said in a blog post that it expects Comcast to move up in the rankings starting next month.\n\nNetflix has become noticeably slower on major Internet service providers, amid escalating disputes over how Netflix\u2019s huge amounts of traffic should be handled. In many cases, Netflix pays third-party transit providers to deliver traffic from their networks to ISPs such as Comcast. Typically, no money changes hands in these \u201cpeering\u201d arrangements between transit providers and ISPs, but because Netflix is responsible for so much incoming traffic, ISPs feel they should be paid by Netflix\u2019s transit providers to add more capacity.\n\nUnder Netflix\u2019s deal with Comcast, Netflix servers sit in the same data centers that connect to Comcast\u2019s network, effectively cutting out the third-party transit provider. Although Netflix traffic doesn\u2019t get special treatment on the network, the direct connection should still result in better service. (Dan Rayburn at StreamingMedia.com has an detailed explanation of how this works. He also points out that Netflix isn\u2019t paying a new cost, but is simply paying a different provider, so the overall cost to Netflix may be negligible.)\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix\u2019s average speeds continue to decline on Verizon FiOS, Verizon DSL and AT&T DSL, while AT&T U-Verse speeds improved slightly. Both AT&T and Verizon are also seeking payments from Netflix, as Ars Technica points out.\n\nComcast subscribers can now get the first season of House of Cards through their cable box.\n\nAlthough Netflix and Comcast now appear to be living in harmony, that\u2019s not stopping Comcast from trying to give Netflix customers a way out. Under a deal with Sony Pictures, Comcast subscribers can soon buy the first season of the hit Netflix series House of Cards through their cable boxes. Another popular Netflix original, Orange is the New Black, will become available to Comcast subscribers in May, Variety reports.\n\nUntil now, Netflix has been the only place to watch House of Cards without purchasing the entire first season on DVD. But because Comcast\u2019s deal only covers season one, subscribers will still need a Netflix subscription to see how Frank Underwood\u2019s latest schemes play out. Update: Individual episodes of House of Cards are already available from other sources such as Amazon and iTunes.", "362": "Last month, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast for faster access to the cable company\u2019s internet subscribers, allowing users to stream content like the Netflix original series House of Cards at more reliable speeds. How is Comcast repaying them? By licensing the political drama series directly from Sony Pictures so that anyone with Xfinity On Demand cable can watch the show without paying Netflix anything.\n\nSo far, Comcast subscribers will only be able to watch season one of House of Cards on demand, but they also have plans to add the first season of Netflix\u2019s Orange Is the New Black on May 13th, through a separate deal with Lionsgate. Season two of House of Cards, which went up on Netflix in its entirety on February 14th can\u2019t be far behind.\n\nWhile Netflix will still holds the online streaming rights for House of Cards, Sony is in charge of \u201chome video\u201d distribution, which in 2014 means programs like this one with Comcast. The show will be available in the Xfinity Store as soon as Tuesday, March 11th for purchase and can be viewed on traditional television, online or on mobile through the Xfinity app in iOS or Android devices.\n\nUPDATE (2:50pm ET): According to a representative from Comcast, House of Cards season one will not be available in the Xfinity Store for another approximately 30 days.

His proper introduction in the finale is a medley of contradictions. He is intelligent and crude at the same time. Beastly and\u2014 when it amuses him\u2014 urbane.\n\nLet us focus a moment on his voice\u2014 or rather, voices. Thomas Harris' own Clarice Starling did everything in her power to lose her West Virginia accent, afraid it would paint her as white trash. Errol dances from voice to voice without apparent effort.

As we approached the end of the saga of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, tensions ran high. Would they finally solve the mystery of the Yellow King? Was last week\u2019s revelation a confirmation of the killer\u2019s identity, or a red herring? Could it be that the whole thing just one of Rust\u2019s acid traps? And of course, the most important question of all: CARCOSA WTF? Well, the season is over. And now we know everything\u2026or at least, as much as we\u2019ll ever know. SPOILERS FROM HERE:\n\n(UPDATE: Click here for our critic Jeff Jensen\u2019s take on the finale.) Did True Detective have a happy ending? That might sounds like a strange description of an hour of television that prominently featured one of the freakier psychopaths to grace the small screen, the final revelation of Carcosa the Terror Temple, a druggy vision of what appeared to be an Event Horizon wormhole to hell, and both protagonists stabbed with various stabby weapons. But given the season of gloom that preceded it, the season finale of True Detective ended on a note of veritable optimism. \u201cOnce there was only dark,\u201d said Rust Cohle The Nihilist Anti-hero as a closing line/epitaph. \u201cYou ask me, light\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nIt took some time to get there. The boys finally managed to track down Errol Childress the Lawnmower Man. (With a hat tip to Marty: He\u2019s the one who finally connected the whole \u201cgreen-eared spaghetti monster\u201d description to a new coat of green paint on a house from the old Dora Lange case.) That led Rust and Marty out to Errol\u2019s house, which he shared with his aunt/girlfriend and his decaying dead father.\n\nThey chased him into what appeared to be some kind of overgrown ruined temple \u2014 or maybe there was some actual infrastructural use for it, in the days before it became a palace of all manner of satanic terror. \u201cThis is Carcosa,\u201d intoned Errol. Rust had a vision straight out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie of a cosmic event in the darkness\u2026and then Errol attacked. He stabbed Rust, and would have killed him\u2026if Rust hadn\u2019t used his Nihilist Headbutt Super Attack. That gave Marty enough time to shoot Errol a couple times. At which point Errol threw what appeared to be a tomahawk Marty\u2019s chest. Marty barely survived \u2014 but Rust finally put the bad man down, shooting him in the head.\n\nRust looked halfway dead, and Martin not much better. But shockingly, they both survived. Rust seemed disappointed. They hadn\u2019t tracked down every member of the Tuttle family, after all. \u201cWe ain\u2019t gonna get them all,\u201d said Marty. \u201cThat ain\u2019t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.\u201d Rust, despondent, explained that he didn\u2019t think he belonged on this world. When he was near-death, he had a vision \u2014 of his daughter, his father, his dead loved ones. \u201cIt was like I was a part of everything I ever loved,\u201d he said, near tears and then beyond them. Was this whole show about Rust learning to accept his daughter\u2019s death? Learning to be human again?

Check out our TV critic Jeff Jensen\u2019s take on the finale.", "368": "True Detective wrapped its celebrated, intensely parsed first season last night with a finale that has invited a wide variety of reactions. Your opinion might hinge on whether or not you found the revelation of The Yellow King \u2014 Errol Childress, aka The Lawnmower Man \u2014 and his evil to be interesting and a surprisingly uplifting, optimistic ending for Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) to be the correct call for the series. The man behind the madness stands behind his choices, although the writer (best known before this for the crime novel Galveston) sounds a bit relieved that the roller coaster ride of his first major work for television has reached its conclusion. \u201cOur long national nightmare is over!\u201d laughs Nic Pizzolatto, jumping on the phone not long after the east coasting airing, and before watching the finale with his family and music supervisor T. Bone Burnett at McConaughey\u2019s house. In this brief interview, Pizzolatto discusses his endgame vision, clarifies Errol\u2019s master plan, and teases season 2 of True Detective \u2014 and the future of Cohle and Hart.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So let\u2019s talk about the twist ending: Rust Cohle and Marty Hart walk away from this alive. I was not expecting that. I also wasn\u2019t expecting that we\u2019d get to see them process the experience to the extent that they did. And then there was the strong note of optimism at the end. Why did you want to end this story this way?\n\nNIC PIZZOLATTO: A few reasons. We\u2019re never going to spend time with these guys again. And killing characters on television has become an easy short cut to cathartic emotion. So I thought killing the guys, or having something more mysterious happen to them \u2013 like the guys charged into Errol\u2019s underworld, and disappeared, and nobody knows what happens to them \u2013 would have been the same thing if the show had gone full-bore into the supernatural: To me, it would have been puerile, and it would have skirted all the issues the show raised. To me, the challenge was to not only let these guys live, but show true character change through this journey. That passing through the eye of the needle in the heart of darkness has actually done something to them.\n\nThe challenge was to create an emotionally resonant ending that made the journey worthwhile. And it felt to me like my proper relationship to the characters should end with me allowing them to walk away into some kind of immortal life outside of this show. I mean, it ends with them exiting stage right, right? We don\u2019t know what kind of life they\u2019ll have. But I think we can be sure that each man is more willing to acknowledge the presence of grace. That was one of the ways that they both failed the same: Neither man would accommodate the idea of grace for their own reasons. Where I wanted them to go in their journeys wasn\u2019t a point of redemption or conversion or even closure but a point of deliverance. They are not healed, but now, for the first time, you can imagine a future where they are healed. And before that was never a possibility for Cohle and hardly a possibility for Hart. But now it\u2019s a real earned possibility.\n\nYou closed the show with Cohle talking about the stars \u2013 a metaphor for good versus evil, light versus dark \u2013 and how as a kid he\u2019d look up at the stars and create stories. All of which reminded me that of storytellers of antiquity, assigning heroic myths to the stars. What was the meaning of that sequence for you?\n\nThere was a part in the show that wound up getting cut, in which Cohle detailed his childhood in Alaska, and he described having no entertainment, now way to pass the time than to walk around in the night, with his synesthesia, it would seem like he could hear the stars ringing. That was his television show. I think what True Detective keeps telling you, over and over again, is that everything\u2019s a story. Who you tell yourself you are, what you tell yourself what the world is, an investigation, a religion, a nihilistic point of view \u2013 these are all stories you tell yourself. You need to be careful what stories you tell yourself.\n\nYou said there was no conversion in the story. But was Cohle suggesting he now believes in some kind of afterlife when he told Hart about his near death experience?\n\nIt\u2019s not a belief \u2013 he\u2019s talking about an experience. And he\u2019s not talking about a reconciliation with loved ones after death: If you listen to what he says, he says, \u2018I was gone. There was no me. Just love\u2026 and then I woke up.\u2019 That line is significant to the whole series: \u201cAnd then I woke up.\u201d The only thing like a conversion that he has is when he says, \u201cYou\u2019re looking at it wrong. To me, the light is winning.\u201d And that doesn\u2019t describe a conversion to me as much as it describes a broadening of perspective. The man who once said there is no light at the end of the tunnel is now saying there might be order to this. I don\u2019t think it says anything more than: Pick your stories carefully.\n\nErrol Childress was pungent with rot and weird. What was your philosophy regarding the villain of the show and how you portrayed him in the finale?\n\nWe had kept the monster behind the curtain and we needed to get to know him. We had showed aspects of the monster and we had showed the historical genesis of the monster or at least provided enough information to describe him. For the finale, I thought the audience deserved to get a close point of view on the monster, and to recognize him the way you recognize the heroes of True Detective. There are no monsters other than humans, no heroes other than humans. The challenge with Errol was to imply an entire history and personal mythology and methodology within the limited amount of time we had with him. Since this was the finale, I thought we could make room for one more point of view, the dark mirror to our characters, the shadow they\u2019ve been chasing for so 17 years without knowing it, the historical victim of bad men who murders women and children.\n\nErrol spoke of a rather mysterious, occult agenda: He spoke of aspiring to an \u201cascension.\u201d What was Errol really up to? What did he want?\n\nThat\u2019s a really good question, and I don\u2019t know if it benefits me to answer it. We definitely had an idea \u2013 I laid out for Glenn Fleshler, who played Errol, and for our art department, in terms of who this killer was, what he was doing, and how he lived. In the beginning, when he says, \u201cMy ascension removes me the disc in the loop,\u201d he\u2019s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he\u2019s hitting upon his personal mythology. When he says, \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since I left my mark, would they have eyes to see,\u201d we can tell from that that he\u2019s angling for a reckoning, for a showdown. He\u2019s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth. This whole idea of time as a circle, yeah, that\u2019s Nietzsche and quantum cosmology, but that\u2019s also the Karmic wheel. If you mentioned something like Karma to someone like Cohle, he\u2019d probably throw up.\n\nSo it\u2019s fair to interpret from the finale that Errol wanted death and was inviting it?\n\nYes, he was inviting it.\n\nWould it be fair to interpret from the series as a whole that Errol was trying to expose the monsters who made him, his family, by leaving clues that implicated them?\n\nYes. You can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him. And Cohle and Hart don\u2019t get absolute justice at the end. Cohle says, we didn\u2019t get them all. But they got a branch from a big rotten tree, and Hart says, we got ours, and basically, the rest of the tree is up to other people.\n\nErrol seemed to consume a lot of pop culture. He had stacks of DVDs and books and magazine in his house, he watched North by Northwest on television. What was his relationship to it?\n\nI had an entire biography for Errol. For example, he taught himself to sound like other people by watching movies on his VCR. That\u2019s why one minute he can sound like Andy Griffith inviting you to the fishing hole, and the next second he sound like James Mason, and then the next, he can sound like something otherworldly. So yeah: if we\u2019re talking about the stories we tell ourselves, if identity is a story, this killer we get to know a little at the end, his identity seems completely fluid, depending on what story needs to be told, or, in the case of the North By Northwest scene, whatever story is in front of him.\n\nAre you prepared for the theories or varied wild interpretations that might come with this ending?\n\nAbout four weeks ago, I realized I had to completely avoid the Internet. So I am going to just keep doing that. Once it really got out there, and people were buying The King In Yellow, I wanted to tell them, \u201cDon\u2019t buy that! Go buy Galveston!\u201d [Laughs] I realized that people need to have their own journey with the show. Whatever they end up with \u2013 whatever theories they have or don\u2019t have \u2013 that\u2019s what it means to connect with an audience. One of the most exciting things to see from people who really like the show is that it has inspired such great creativity in them. There are websites of True Detective artwork out there now and it\u2019s beautiful. And I don\u2019t want to take that away from anybody. I know what it means to me. But I don\u2019t want to take away anyone\u2019s interpretation of the show. If they have an interpretation that means it lives inside them and they connected with the show.\n\nTrue Detective doted a lot on religion. What does that subject/theme mean to you?\n\nIt\u2019s one of the stories we tell ourselves. I lived in the rural south in a heavily religious family but the only thing I can point to there is this real sensitivity between knowing and wishing. We live in a culture that has a real hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. Even when they\u2019re told something is fiction. I have people in the same breath ask me \u201cIs this show supernatural?\u201d and then ask me \u201cWhat are you saying about Louisiana?\u201d As if I am making a documentary. It\u2019s a work of fiction. And it reflects one of things that fascinates me about our species and our culture is what we do with stories. I mean, look at people did with this story! It was a nice lesson learned for me. The show is not anti-religion or anti-anything. The show is against not thinking.\n\nWhat\u2019s the update on season two?\n\nI am still fleshing it out. The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there\u2019s been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way.\n\nIs it true that you\u2019ve retained the literary rights to Cohle and Hart?\n\nI do. So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility.\n\nTwitter: @EWDocJensen", "369": "Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in a scene from HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d (Credit: Jim Bridges/HBO)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Alyssa Rosenberg is PostOpinions\u2019s new culture blogger. Her own blog will be launching in the coming days. This post discusses the season finale of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d in extensive detail.\n\nAs the final episode of the first season of HBO\u2019s hit anthology series \u201cTrue Detective\u201d approached this Sunday, the show\u2019s obsessive audience puzzled over what might happen when former detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) caught up to the serial killer they\u2019d been chasing across Louisiana for almost two decades. Would Marty, the genial Louisiana native, turn out to be the killer, hiding his brilliant scheme by playing the dummy to his more philosophically inclined partner? Would Marty and Rust finally learn that the secret they\u2019d repeatedly missed had been obvious all along to the women they routinely abuse and ignore? Or, in keeping with the show\u2019s many references to the Carcosa mythos, a concept shared among horror and fantasy writers for more than a century, would monsters from another world appear on the shores of the Louisiana bayou?\n\nIn an interview before the series finale, series creator Nic Pizzolatto suggested something even weightier than an interlocking literary game. Explaining the stakes that Rust and Marty were facing as they reached the end stage of their quest, Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed\u2019s Kate Aurthur: \u201cI think given the amorphous nature of the evil they\u2019re pursuing, its historical roots in culture and government, they would have to be willing to die to fully pursue their absolute justice.\u201d\n\nSussing out the \u201chistorical roots in culture and government\u201d of sex crimes and the biases that let them go unprosecuted is a fascinating goal for any show to set itself. And it would have been a particularly strong mission statement for \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d The show was shot in Louisiana, and in its early episodes it showed some real signs of interest in what happens to the working poor when they become disabled by accidents or exposed to the compounds produced in the region\u2019s chemical refineries. And Pizzolatto has described this season of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d \u2014 any that follow would have different characters and a different case \u2014 as \u201ca close, two-person point-of-view show.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting opportunity to explore how two white, middle-class men might have been hobbled by their perspectives into blaming poor men for rich men\u2019s crimes and coverups. A confrontation between two such men, the forces they\u2019re aligned against and their own views of the world would be a fraught and original encounter.\n\nBut the finale of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d didn\u2019t do any of that. Instead, we got a predictable crime story that even the show\u2019s most ardent defenders are going to be hard-put to argue is a clever examination of the genre, or of political power in Louisiana. The real killer of Dora Lange (Amanda Rose Batz), the first victim Rust and Marty investigated, turns out to be Errol Childress (Glenn Fleshler), the son of former sheriff Ted Childress. That relationship might have been enough to protect Errol, but he had other connections. Ted Childress was the unacknowledged son of Sam Tuttle, a powerful Louisiana patriarch. As a result, the Childresses were related to Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders), Sam Tuttle\u2019s son and a powerful minister who tried to interfere with Rust and Marty\u2019s initial investigation into the serial killings in 1995. And Ted\u2019s cousin was Eddie Tuttle, who served first as Louisiana governor and then as senator.\n\nThat\u2019s a rich web of power and family to explore, but \u201cTrue Detective\u201d leaves most of its revelations for the last hour of the show, leaving little time to meditate on specific relationships or Louisiana politics. Sheriff Childress covered up for Errol during the 1995 case, altering a missing persons case file to say that the report was made \u201cin error.\u201d His deputy sheriff, Steve Geraci, admits this all to Rust and Marty in the final episode, excusing his lack of curiosity about the change by telling the two men, \u201cThere\u2019s a chain of command. No reason to change it. I just follow what the big man says. It\u2019s how this all works.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s awfully anemic writing on a theme that\u2019s familiar to anyone with a bedtime late enough to let them stay up for \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d And Geraci\u2019s speech gives us no particular insight into what it might mean to be the \u201cbig man\u201d Childress apparently was in the specific time and place that was Louisiana in 1995. We certainly don\u2019t get any insight into why Rust and Marty weren\u2019t curious at the time that Billy Lee Tuttle wanted to gain control of their case by assigning it to a task force. Rust may end up castigating himself for not having identified Errol as the killer earlier. But he and Marty were, in their own ways, just as willing to look away from the Tuttles and Childress as Geraci, a man they threaten for his cowardice and blindness.\n\nRust and Marty don\u2019t show any more curiosity about a woman (the spectacular and underused Ann Dowd) they find with Errol, who appears to have some sort of intellectual disability \u2014 and neither does \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d As the police swam in to the Childress family estate, she sits, terrified, among the wreckage of Errol\u2019s mad fantasies, utterly alone. Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) later tells Marty that she was \u201cat least a half sister\u201d to Errol, substituting a lazy stereotype about Southern incest for any insight into how she, and Errol\u2019s dead victims, could go so utterly missing, or have been so invisible in the first place.\n\nMarty and Rust may have unhealthy relationships with women. But \u201cTrue Detective\u201d doesn\u2019t actually show any more interest in the vanished women than they did. The show took time to demonstrate that the stories Rust and Marty told other detectives were lies, and even to linger as Marty narrated his way through a public records database. But it couldn\u2019t make space in its eight episodes to give these women\u2019s lives more purpose than as catalysts for Rust and Marty\u2019s redemptions. Dora Lange emerges only in stories her ex tells about her. Prostitutes, domestic workers and chemical plant employees offer links in an investigative chain and are never heard from again.\n\nEven Marty\u2019s much put-upon ex-wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) and estranged daughters ultimately showed up in the hospital to provide Marty with a tangible reward for his follow-through. Given that \u201cTrue Detective\u201d has strongly implied from its earliest episodes that Marty\u2019s older daughter Audrey (Madison Wolfe) might have been a victim of abuse, or at least a witness to it, this disinterest in her inner life or the truth of what happened to her is particularly off-putting. In the world of \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d a man can do pretty much anything short of turning a woman into a paraphilic love map or trapping her in a house of horrors, and still deserve tender ministrations. And even as \u201cTrue Detective\u201d reacts in disgust to men who treat women as disposable, it also acts the same way toward Audrey, and to anyone who might have lived to receive the justice Dora Lange was denied.\n\nAfter Errol\u2019s been killed and the case has gone national, we see a credulous news anchor telling her audience that reporting \u201cdiscredited rumors that the accused was, in any way, related to Louisiana Senator Edmund Tuttle.\u201d The Tuttles don\u2019t even have to be tainted by association with a crooked branch in their family tree, much less take responsibility for any complicity they might have had in Errol\u2019s crimes. Rust is discouraged, because he and Marty both know from a horrifying videotape that Errol wasn\u2019t the only person involved in the ritual abuse of young women\u2013he was just the last surviving member of his horrifying little community. But Marty bucks him up by insisting that he and Rust did their share and shouldn\u2019t fret over the justice that\u2019s eluded them. \u201cWe ain\u2019t never gonna get \u2019em all. That ain\u2019t what kind of world it is,\u201d Marty says. \u201cBut we got ours.\u201d\n\nThat, apparently, is supposed to be enough to satisfy us. \u201cOnce there was only dark,\u201d Rust tells Marty as the two men look up at the stars. \u201cIf you ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d But telling us that the powerful will get off, and that there\u2019s nothing to learn about why it happens so why bother, is a view of politics even blacker and more tangled than the Lair of Crazy Errol built in an old French fort. The Rusts and Martys of that world end up recovering in the hospital with the luxury to reach those cynical conclusions. The Dora Langes of it end up dead.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u201cTrue Detective\u201d finale crashes HBO GO\n\nMeet the band behind the \u201cTrue Detective\u201d theme song", "370": "Photo still from True Detective \u00a9 2014 Home Box Office\n\n\n\nAs Rust Cohle warned us at the end of Episode 3 of True Detective, \u201cThis is a world where nothing is solved.\u201d At the end of the first season, the show didn\u2019t so much explain all the answers as gesture toward them, leaving us to fill in the blanks (or, perhaps, plot holes). Below, we take our best crack at answering the finale\u2019s big questions.\n\n\n\nWhat movie was Errol watching at the beginning of the finale? And what was with all the creepy accents?\n\n\n\nErrol is watching North by Northwest. True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto explained his thinking behind this scene in an interview with Alan Sepinwall:\n\nThere was this idea that when he talks in his real voice, it\u2019s very slurred because of the scarring. My background for him was that he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow were the Tuttles involved?\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear whether the Tuttles were directly involved in Errol\u2019s crimes or whether they just helped cover them up. Toward the end of the finale, a newscaster says that rumors of a suggested family tie between the senator and Errol Childress had been denied. But we know better: They\u2019re closely related, and the reverend, at least, was in deep. It seems likely that his powerful cousin was a part of the conspiracy, too, if not a participant in the crimes.\n\nThe reverend\u2019s father and the senator\u2019s uncle, Sam Tuttle, was Errol\u2019s grandfather. He raped both Errol and Errol\u2019s sister, and he was open enough about his sexual appetites that his housekeeper, at least\u2014whom we met in Episode 7\u2014was well aware of them. Reverend Tuttle knew more: He kept a videotape of Marie Fontenot\u2019s rape (and perhaps her murder), which occurred in the place Errol called Carcosa, in his safe. What\u2019s more, Reverend Tuttle helped cover up the sexual abuse that took place at one of his Wellspring schools, in part by dismissing a deacon and claiming that it was due to charges of embezzlement. Did he orchestrate the abuse as well? True Detective doesn\u2019t say.\n\n\n\nHow did Papania find Rust and Marty in order to save them?\n\n\n\nPresumably Marty is eventually able to find a working phone in the house to call him, though the episode doesn\u2019t show this happen.\n\n\n\nWhy does Rust say, \u201cL\u2019chaim, fat ass\u201d? Isn't that kind of a random thing for a nihilist Texan to say?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is the Rule of Cool. (If something\u2019s awesome enough, you don\u2019t need to explain it.) The slightly longer answer is that the quote seems to be a reference to Daredevil comics. Here\u2019s the panel in which Marvel superhero uses the line as a kiss-off to his archrival.\n\nAs people untangle tonight's True Detective, here's one source: a 2003 Daredevil with the \"L'chaim, fatass\" quip pic.twitter.com/hKh4garWC3 -- Ben Greenman (@bengreenman) March 10, 2014\n\nWho was the Yellow King?\n\n\n\nThis guy:\n\nPhoto courtesy HBO\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(Costume designer Jenny Eagan confirmed this in our interview.)\n\n\n\nAt Carcosa, how was Errol able to make his voice appear to be everywhere at once?\n\n\n\nSince Pizzolatto has said that \u201cthere is nothing supernatural\u201d about the crimes in True Detective, it seems safe to assume that this, like Cohle\u2019s final swirling cosmic vision, is a hallucination. (Either that, or Errol\u2019s \u201cCarcosa\u201d has really crazy acoustics.)\n\n\n\nIs there really a fort like that in Louisiana?\n\nYes. The Carcosa scenes were filmed on location at Fort Macomb, which was built in 1822.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Infrogmation courtesy Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nWhy did Errol draw so much attention to Dora Lange\u2014even lighting the fire that drew the police to her body?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPizzolatto offered his explanation in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:\n\nYou can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him.\n\nWhat does Errol mean when he says, \u201cMy ascension removes me the disc in the loop?\u201d\n\n\n\nErrol\u2019s mythology perhaps can\u2019t be reasonably explained\u2014the simplest answer seems to be simply \u201che\u2019s crazy\u201d\u2014but Pizzolatto offered his own explanation to Entertainment Weekly:\n\nIn the beginning, when he says, \u201cMy ascension removes me the disc in the loop,\u201d he\u2019s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he\u2019s hitting upon his personal mythology.

He\u2019s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhy is the finale called \u201cForm and Void\u201d?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a reference to Genesis 1:2:\n\nAnd the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n\nThis also ties back to Rust\u2019s closing speech. Rust reminds Marty, \u201cOnce there was only dark. You ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d It isn\u2019t until the following verse that God says, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat was up with the flower motif?\n\n\n\nIt may have been just a coincidence. In our interview with True Detective costume designer Jenny Eagan, we asked her if there was any hidden meaning to all the flowers featured in the costumes. She told us, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d\n\n\n\nDo painters really get paint on their ears?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWe put this question to Alan of the All Los Angeles Painting Company:\n\n\n\nSometimes? Not normally. You might get a few drops on them. Unless you\u2019re a member of the Three Stooges, or something. When you\u2019re an experienced painter, no, it\u2019s very rare. Unlesssss\u2014never mind, no. No, any level of experience, and it wouldn\u2019t happen, unless you were spraying all over and you weren\u2019t wearing a mask. And then you would have paint everywhere, not just on your ears.\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about Season 2?\n\n\n\nNot much. From that same Alan Sepinwall interview with Pizzolatto:", "371": "It is hard to recall the last time a television series has gripped the cultural consciousness so quickly, spawning memes, a sprawling amount of Internet speculation and commentary, as well as divisive conversations about gender roles on television (check out Emily Nussbaum\u2019s harsh, but terrific piece in The New Yorker for more on that) as much as True Detective has. At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.\n\nSince its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange\u2019s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show\u2019s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.\n\nThe foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.\n\nThe first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the \u201cspaghetti monster\u201d had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.\n\nHowever, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga\u2019s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven\u2019t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress\u2019s home.", "372": "Fans of the thriller \"True Detective\" were disappointed when HBO's streaming service crashed on Sunday during the much anticipated finale of the hit show.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNervously twitching and wired fans on the East Coast logged onto the HBO GO streaming service at 9 p.m. only to be faced with a spinning circle on a black screen.\n\nThe streaming service, which is only available by subscription, login, and password, apparently just had too many users logging in a once.\n\nHBO GO recognized the problem and send a tweet saying they were addressing the issue.\n\nDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users.

Much like Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale on The Wire, Rust (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty (Woody Harrelson) find in each other an adversary, a counterpoint, and a literal, and figurative, partner in crime. \"You're obsessive,\" Marty informs Rust. \"You're obsessive, too,\" Rust retorts, \"just not about the job.\" Marty's obsession, of course, is women other than the mother of his children, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan). At the beginning of True Detective, we are introduced to Marty's first mistress, Lisa (Alexis Daddario), a court reporter who, as Rust later observes, pretty much looks like a younger, bustier version of Mrs. Hart.\n\nAs critics have argued all over the 'net, True Detective is either infuriatingly, brutishly misogynistic (The New Yorker) or purposefully misogynistic, and therefore, thoughtfully dismissive of its female characters (Slate). Regardless of intention, creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga have made a blanket statement regarding their purview on female sexuality. And it's pretty judgmental. A woman seeking sex is playing with fire. Over the course of the show's blistering eight episodes, we see a a variety of sexual situations, but none that resemble a realistically intimate moment. On True Detective, a woman who succumbs to sexual advances (or seeks physical satisfaction) is asking for humiliation, dismissal, or emotional ruin. If she wasn't asking for it, the show seems to suggest, she shouldn't have worn such a short skirt.\n\nRelated: 'Nymphomaniac' Makes Me Proud to Be a Woman\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nWhether we're privy to a spectacularly nubile young woman throwing herself at the paunchy, married Marty or a mentally disturbed woman begging her own deranged half-brother to \"make flowers\" on her, the women of True Detective have a uniformly peculiar relationship with the opposite sex. Even Maggie\u2014who, based on her interactions with Detectives Gilbough and Papania has enough agency to withhold information, use deductive reasoning, and even drop the occasional feminist pronouncement regarding the uniform idiocy of men\u2014falls victim to a familiar male gaze sex trope. After she's all but gotten a confession out of her philandering husband, Marty begins to whimper about being \"all fucked up.\" Sure, he's cheated on her, several times and with sociopathic abandon, but he's also seen things on the job that he simply can't forget. Fucked up things. He's having a hard time reconciling his professional life and his work life. He's just, hell, he's just having a really hard time, Maggie! She can see the hurt in his eyes, and the evidence of too many long nights on the underarms of his threadbare wife beater, and feels compelled to soothe his pain with a flurry of passionate kisses. What about this scenario screams sympathy sex? Am I missing something?\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nThen, there's Maggie's tryst with Rust. After making eyes at each other all season, Rust, who seems to appreciate and value Maggie's intelligence and sophistication, violently takes her from behind in perhaps the heartbreakingest seven seconds of TV sex. It was an especially gutting moment because, despite his erratic behavior and willingness to cover up for Marty's indiscretions, we think Rust is a good guy. We see him turn down advancements from drug-addled prostitutes; he drinks to drown out the memory of his slain daughter; and when he engages Maggie in conversation, it feels like her adores her. Until he degrades her. And then accuses her of Black Widow-ing her way between him and his partner. She's scarcely pulled up her underwear before she is cast out of his apartment like a leper. \"Get the fuck out of here!\" he bellows, any hint of tenderness and longing drained from his red-rimmed eyes. Et tu, Rust?\n\nRelated: Why Changing Your Hair Makes You a Sundance Clich\u00e9\n\n\"I like something wild. I always did,\" Marty tells Rust of his penchant for \"crazy\" women. \"Feels like it smoothes out the other parts of my life.\" I'm sorry, but we're supposed to believe that an over-the-hill cop is a magnet for insanely gorgeous but totally unstable women? That, in the back country of Louisianna, there exists an enclave of job-holding psychowhores, who simply cannot resist Marty's butter blonde mop and Jameson breath? \"You're a good man,\" Lisa, a former teen prostitute who now works at a local T-mobile store, impresses upon Marty. He and his badge had, after all, come to her bunny ranch looking for a missing girl. Between swigs from a pony neck beer, he tries on a look of chagrined humility for size. Bingo. She becomes obsessed and sooon starts sending scantily-clad selfies and begging her married lover to \"put it in her ass.\" Again, Where do these women get this stuff?\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nThe icing on the cake is Marty's own teenage daughter, Audrey (Erin Moriarty) who gets busted trying to attempt a threesome with two of the ugliest, strung out dudes south of the Mason-Dixon. Upon discovering what she's done, Marty slaps her and calls her a \"whore.\" Whether the irony that his daughter is precisely the kind of woman he's been sleeping with is lost on him or suddenly glaringly obvious, all I could think was, She wanted to have a threesome with those guys? For real? In what world are these women falling victim to these men? What kind of dog-eared, graphic novel served as Pizzolatto and Fukunaga's sex ed primer? Despite their varying lots in life\u2014incest-friendly love interest of a child murderer, suburban housewife, reformed sex worker, attention seeking high schooler\u2014there's really only one type of woman on True Detective: the blow-up doll.\n\nPhotos: Ann Dowd: Jim Spellman/WireImage; Lili Simmons: C Flanigan/FilmMagic; Erin Moriarty: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic", "374": "by Tierney Monaghan\n\nGoing into the season finale, True Detective had a lot of expectations swirling around. Theories about the Yellow King abounded on the Internet. Parody videos proliferated. Writer Nic Pizzolatto was interviewed about whether he\u2019d learned anything from the first season of The Killing, a show he worked on previously. People were nervous that True Detective might end in the same way that show had, by not coming to any conclusions at all.\n\nWhen the show arrived, an estimated 11 million people wanted to see how this would end. As many people tried to stream the show on HBO Go, the servers crashed and the wait for the finale continued for several hours.\n\n\u201cForm and Void\u201d picks up right where \u201cAfter You\u2019ve Gone\u201d left off last week. The episode opens at the Childress compound, where Errol Childress, the scarred man, is telling a man who is chained to a bed frame that if he behaves, he can have some more water around noon. Errol picks up a slop bucket, and leaves the small cottage, walking back to the main house, which is basically rotting away. In the house is a mentally challenged woman who is both cowed and cuddled by Errol. He asks her to tell him a story again, which turns out to be a description of her molestation by her grandfather.\n\nMeanwhile, Hart and Cohle are still on the fishing boat with Sheriff Gerasi, trying to get the real story of what happened in the Marie Fontenot case. Cohle forces Gerasi to watch the video of Fontenot\u2019s torture, and he spills the story from there. Gerasi took the original missing persons report on Fontenot. Later, he went back and the report was marked \u201cmade in error.\u201d Sheriff Childress had done this, claiming he\u2019d spoken to the family and that the girl had been sent to live with her father. Gerasi says that he had nothing else to do with the case, that he was following chain of command. Within a year, he was working for the state CID based on Sheriff Childress\u2019 recommendation.\n\nHaving received all the information they can from Gerasi, Hart and Cohle dock the fishing boat they stole, threaten Gerasi with a sniper if he says anything and head out to continue their investigation. They are still searching for the identity of the scarred man. The definitive clue comes from a picture taken during the canvassing during the Lange case. An elderly woman\u2019s recollection of getting her house painted leads Hart and Cohle through the tax records and leads them to the address of Childress & Sons maintenance.\n\nEver the pessimist, Cohle leaves his boss copies of their investigation notes and the video of Marie Fontenot\u2019s torture to be mailed to the authorities and the media. Should he and Hart disappear for more than a day, his boss is to mail the packages, which will hopefully lead the authorities to the Childress compound. Then Hart and Cohle take off to see what is afoot at the address they\u2019ve found. This brings us back around to the creepy, overgrown, dilapidated house from the beginning of the episode.\n\nThe car is barely parked in front of the house when Cohle takes off toward the cottage and fields beyond. Hart knocks on the door, posing as a surveyor who is lost and needs to use the phone. The woman answers the door, and says they don\u2019t have a phone. After Cohle yells for him, Hart pushes his way into the house, checking to make sure Errol isn\u2019t hiding in there. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come for you. He\u2019s worse than anyone,\u201d the woman warns him. Around this same time, Cohle spots Errol out in the field and takes chase after him.\n\nThe chase leads into some sort of catacomb/tunnel system. It\u2019s packed with the wicker sculptures that have peppered the crime scenes throughout the episodes. Cohle winds ever deeper through the vine choked passages in pursuit of Errol. As Errol taunts him from the distance, he speeds up, not checking corners as carefully. Entering a large chamber with an opening to the sky, Errol steps from the shadows and skewers Cohle with a large knife. He is lifted of his feet by the force of the thrust, and then dropped on the ground when Hart catches up with them. Hart catches an axe in the chest for his troubles. As Errol leans over him, Cohle manages to sit up and move around enough to shoot Errol in the head. It is an undetermined amount of time later when the authorities arrive and shoot a flare into the sky, which Hart and Cohle see through the hole in the ceiling of the chamber.\n\nBoth of the former detectives end up at Lafayette General Hospital. Marty\u2019s daughters and Maggie come to visit him, and he falls apart as he tries to convince them he\u2019s going to be okay. Cohle ends up in a coma after his surgery, but eventually awakes and hears more about the progress of the case on the news. Hart continually visits him, even making arrangements for where he\u2019ll go once he leaves the hospital. One night, Hart wheels his partner outside for a cigarette and the conversation turns to the case and how Cohle sees the whole experience. After he struggles to describe his near death experience, Cohle says that in the end, there is \u201cjust one story, the oldest. Light versus dark.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a succinct summation of this season of True Detective. It has been an intriguing, occasionally frustrating meditation on light versus dark. I\u2019m left with the sense that even though the light won this round, it was a very near thing. Perhaps what this show has done best is to explore the vast gray areas of personal and societal morality. When even the \u201cgood guys\u201d struggle to keep the darkness at the edges of their lives, what hope is there for all of us as a whole? Thank you, Rust Cohle. Now I sound as conflicted and pessimistic as you.", "375": "I hate when a good series ends, not just because I will miss the show, but because I so rarely like the endings.\n\n\u201cTrue Detective\u201d became the latest series to complain about, as HBO\u2019s wonderfully tilted mystery series came with a finale that seemed to have little to do with the show we had been watching for the previous seven episodes.\n\n(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d skip to the next item.)\n\n\u201cTrue Detective\u201d had been the best new series of the year so far, a bizarre and engrossing tale that took the framework of a highly conventional police drama and overlaid it with flowery speech and philosophical ideas, most of them coming from Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character, Rust Cohle, a person so badly damaged psychologically as to be almost non-functional.\n\nThe storytelling used parallel time tracks and unreliable narration to give the story extra layers of mystery. It was baffling and sometimes hard to follow, but it was always intriguing.\n\nBut it came in the guise of a police-buddy drama we had seen 1,000 times before. Cohle\u2019s partner, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), was a hard-working, philandering, family-ignoring homicide detective. Cohle and Hart were the mavericks, bucking the chain of command for ultimately noble causes. They tracked down a serial killer and \u2013 of course \u2013 found the trail leading through \u201crespectable\u201d society.\n\nWe assumed, all along, that at some point the archetype would be shattered in a new and clever way. Instead, we found Sunday that it was our assumptions that would be shattered, and convention would triumph because the show didn\u2019t really know how it wanted to end.\n\nBad guy Errol Childress \u2013 there was no last twist \u2013 seemed almost laughably absurd and certainly not the sort of villain one expected at the end of the twisted road we had traveled. Worse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.\n\nThe story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring \u201cTrue Detective\u201d back next year, with a different cast and story altogether. Let\u2019s hope creator Nic Pizzolatto thinks that one all the way through to the end.\n\nYOUR \u2018MOTHER\u2019 SHOULD KNOW\n\nThe ending of another series, \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.\n\nThe March 3 episode appeared to confirm a long-held but faintly embraced hypothesis about the Mother of the title: She\u2019s dead.\n\nThe conceit of this mild-mannered sitcom is that the show takes place in 2030, and Josh Radnor\u2019s character, Ted, is recalling the events of today for his children, explaining to them the torturously long process of how he met their mother. Some fans have speculated that the reason Ted is telling the story is because the mother recently died or is dying.\n\nLike most such theories, it is internally consistent but doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense in context. Why would such a light-hearted comedy spend nine years getting to the point of introducing Ted to the mother \u2013 whose name we still don\u2019t know \u2013 just to reveal that she\u2019s dead? In the all-time ranking of bad sitcom ideas, that would go near the top, somewhere between \u201cMy Mother the Car\u201d and letting Joanie and Chachi have their own show.\n\nCristin Milioti, who plays the mother, poured a big pitcher of ice water on the notion, bluntly telling the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nAny show that has been telegraphing a surprise ending for nine seasons is bound to generate some theories about its finish. We\u2019ve also heard that Ted is the one who is dead/dying, that there will be some switcheroo with the identity of the mother (it\u2019s really Robin!) or that there is some other major twist regarding the veracity of Ted\u2019s storytelling.\n\nMost likely, though, is that Ted\u2019s longing has to do with being separated from the Mother somehow, and she will return to him in the next-to-last scene, right before they meet for the first time on that train platform, in the rain.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter", "376": "The demand for tonight\u2019s season finale of HBO\u2018s True Detective was so great online, the network\u2019s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed trying to fulfill all incoming requests for the closing episode. \u201cDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for # TrueDetective, we\u2019ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users.

That was some sick sick shit they were dealing with and now that it\u2019s over, what\u2019s next and how are they going to top what they\u2019ve given us already? True Detective\u2019s creator Nic Pizzolatto has been throwing down hints. And one is that he\u2019s got to keep pumping out the weird. He\u2019s good with weird. He says \u201cmy wife read a comment the other day that said I live out in the desert, and I run some kind of cult. He says all the talk on the net \"informed exactly one thing. It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight.\"\n\nHe\u2019s right. It was the supernatural suspense that kept me coming back hungry for a little of Carcosa\u2019s time. Pizzolatto says \u201cI'm interested in the atmosphere of cosmic horror, but that's about all I have to say about weird fiction. I did feel the perception was tilted more towards weird fiction than perhaps it should have been. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Detective's lead actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey aren\u2019t coming back. Their commitment and easy rapport is going to be hard to replace. Pizzolato says his stories are usually heavy on the female characters and that next season is going to be about \u201chard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.\u201d The transportation system has an occult history? Did they put the Mass in Mass Transit?\n\nI can see Pizzolatto pouring over old train manuals, finding the symbolic significance of the third rail. The way he referenced Robert W. Chambers\u2019 King in Yellow and works by H.P. Lovecraft and the M-Theory. Or did we all read too much into that ? Pizzolatto says, \u201clook, it's all good \u2026 my only interest in the Chambers stuff is as a story that has a place in American myth. And it's a story about a story that drives people into madness. \u2026 I wouldn't tell anyone to go buy Robert Chambers. It's not that great a book. Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner I think are in there far more than Chambers or Lovecraft.\u201d\n\nPizzolato talked about the strange in the past season. That James Mason voice that Errol Childress slips into after seeing Cary Grant on TV in North by Northwest showed us that \u201che learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies. And that brings us back to the idea of storytelling, right? At one minute he can affect this Andy Griffith good ol' boy voice, the next he can sound like James Mason, and when he wants to use his real voice, he sounds like something wounded and damaged. And then when Cohle is in Carcosa, he sounds like something entirely different.\u201d\n\nTrue Detective returns to HBO next year. I\u2019m watching.

Writer Nic Pizzolatto defied the conventions of television writing (where most scripts are written by committee in a writer\u2019s room) and instead holed himself up alone in a hotel and churned out all eight episodes.\n\nThe result was a wholly personal, truly singular vision overlaid on the most conventional of story structures: two cops hunting for a murderer. In Pizzolatto\u2019s hands, the fractured timeline slows to a crawl and suddenly hurtles forward, and through soliloquies and raised eyebrows reveals the damaged souls of two detectives who tend to say one thing and do just the opposite.\n\nIt\u2019s compelling stuff, and coupled with the masterful performances of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, it's a brand of storytelling that literally shut down HBO GO on Sunday, as viewers clamored to get first \u2013or second\u2014look at the season finale.\n\nThose first six or so episodes programmed us to expect almost anything from the True Detective finale. Except perhaps what we got. Pizzolatto provided the most surprising thing of all\u2014a straight ending. \u201cForm and Void\u201d featured no time shifting, no supernatural tangents, and relatively little in the way of metaphysical asides. (And no Yellow King.) But for the big stars and dazzling camera work, the last hour of True Detective would fit inside an episode of Law and Order. Most of it, anyway.\n\nIn the first 45 minutes or so, Hart and Cohle blitz through the procedures of this procedural as if they had a to-do list. Marty shakes the detective\u2019s curse, finally asking the right question: Why is the Green Monster green? From there they work the case step by step, bouncing from Steve Geraci\u2019s Maserati to an old woman\u2019s tax returns, until they end up rushing in real time from Hart\u2019s strip mall office to the Heart of Darkness.\n\nOur monster? He\u2019s holed up in a house that\u2019s straight out a very special episode of Hoarders, sporting an over-the-top British accent that channels James Mason. \u201cTop notch constitutional!\u201d Errol enunciates. And he calls his German Shepherd \u201cold chap\u201d even as he hurls a frying pan at him.\n\nAnd then it\u2019s the obligatory fight to the death. The scene nods toward Hart and Cohle's previous showdown with Reggie LeDoux. But as it dragged on, it reminded me of the last 15 minutes of The Silence of the Lambs after Anthony Hopkins has taken his fava beans and his nice chianti and split. It\u2019s well crafted but we\u2019ve been down this road before.\n\nUltimately, our heroes do what TV cops do: they catch the bad guy, and they save each other (although it was close for a minute there for ol\u2019 Rust, wudn\u2019t it?) It\u2019s almost like something out of that true crime book that Marty might write.\n\nPizzolatto\u2019s message is pretty straightforward: None of this really matters. Running through the woods with a gun is the least interesting thing that these cops do. I buy the premise, but I'd also argue that it could have been executed better.\n\nTrue Detective\u2019s strengths have been characterization and dialogue. Pizzolatto is great at telling stories, and, with the exception of Cary Fukunaga\u2019s brilliant, breathless single-shot staging of the raid in episode four, the show\u2019s best moments have come when he sticks to that MO.\n\nI think the finale is one place where True Detective might have been better served if Pizzolatto had some help. If these scenes were batted around in a writer\u2019s room\u2014with a couple of the guys from, say, Justified\u2014I believe that the other writers would would have found a way to add style and surprise to scenes that felt like housekeeping. Or they would have encouraged Pizzolatto to make the courageous choice to drastically shorten or even eliminate the procedural parts of the plot altogether.\n\nBut whatever the flaws of the finale\u2019s main plot arc, True Detective found its footing in the last few minutes. The internet notwithstanding, this has never been a story about Dora Lange or the Yellow King. It\u2019s about these two guys who need each other but can\u2019t say it. For all their physical courage, they lack the courage to, well, embrace life. L'chaim indeed, Rust Cohle.\n\nBringing Errol to justice and closing this case? That\u2019s really beside the point. These last two episodes were about healing the old wounds between old friends.\n\nRust Cohle may believe that it took a near-death- experience, in which he saw his departed daughter and his deceased dad, for him to change his view of the world. But it's clear to Pizzolatto--and us-- that seeing Marty again was every bit as important in Rust's transformation.\n\nIn the unlikely setting of a hospital parking lot, Marty and Rust both look heavenward and swap places, ontologically speaking.\n\n\"It's just one story: the oldest, light versus dark,\" says Cohle, vulnerable in a way we've never seen before.\n\n\u201cI know we ain't in Alaska \u201dsays Marty, with newfound grit. \"But it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.\"\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at it wrong, Once there was only dark,\" Cohle replies. \" If you ask me, the light\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nAnd a finely wrought as that dialogue is, it's Marty's little laugh as he helps his friend to the car that sums up the arc of this story.

The show, created by Nic Pizzolatto, follows two detectives played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson during their decades-long search for a cultish killer in the Louisiana bayous. The narrative winds up being equal parts whodunit, nihilist bromance, and name check on obscure weird fiction tales from the 19th century.\n\nAs the Internet blew up Sunday night with kvetching about the no show by HBO GO, the network tweeted this:\n\nDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. \u2014 HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014\n\nSeveral hours later, everything seemed to be resolved, though not without leaving millions of True Detective fans gnashing their teeth about their own descent into an online Carcosa featuring the flat circle of time as an endless buffering loop:\n\nAnd, for those of you who aren't stuck in HBO Go-Cosa, here is your True Detective GIFcap.

The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal,\" an HBO GO spokesperson said in an email sent to PCMag on Monday.\n\nSo how many True Detective viewers were affected by the service disruption? The show has averaged nearly 11 million viewers a week over its eight-episode run, according to The Daily Beast. That's about 38 percent of HBO's estimated 28.7 million subscribers, the site noted, leaning on stats from media research firm SNL Kagan.\n\nAnd how many of those subscribers tried to watch the series finale online? That's tough to say, though as Grantland's John Lopez quipped, perhaps the biggest revelation of True Detective turned out to be that \"HBO GO has a limit to how many people can share their passwords at one time: 11 million.\"\n\nFor more, check out Limited-Series TV and the Web: A Perfect Marriage.", "384": "Part Beauty, Part Hooey: That's A Wrap On 'True Detective'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lacey Terrell/HBO Lacey Terrell/HBO\n\n[This piece contains a detailed discussion of Sunday night's True Detective finale. If you haven't seen it and you plan to see it and you don't want to know what happens, stop reading.]\n\n[Seriously, information ahoy.]\n\nSpoiler alert: The dirty-faced, crazy-talking, disheveled impoverished guy did it.\n\nBecause we are talking about True Detective, this tells you very little, since Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) spent most of these eight episodes moving through a landscape of desperately poor, semi-coherent, literally unwashed people who might or might not be monsters. And in the end, one of them was. And after an almost comically lengthy sequence in which Rust, gun at the ready, tracked him through a labyrinthine maze of increasingly intricate wooden structures, he knifed Russ, put a hatchet in Marty, and then got shot in the head. The bad guy died, and the good guys lived.\n\nMarty's wife and daughters returned to him, and he and Rust lived to share a lovely talk about near-death experiences in which Rust essentially ended (once you made out what the heck that last line even was) on a vaguely positive note.\n\nThere was a lot to admire about True Detective: As many before me have stated, it contained two of the best performances television's celebrated \"golden age\" has offered from Harrelson and McConaughey, and its tone and aesthetic were often gorgeously realized, as in a stunning shot of a road weaving through an array of forked white trees.\n\nCreator Nic Pizzolatto knew exactly what he was going for when it comes to tone, and he went for it consistently, skillfully and inventively. The car chats between Rust and Marty, in which Rust was allowed to echo the great philosophers and Marty was allowed, at times, to put a pin in his grandiose blather, were fantastic from the start, and they kept being fantastic right through the reunion of the two in the 2012 scenes. (I particularly enjoyed Rust's self-consciously poetic reference to humanity as \"sentient meat,\" followed by Marty's puzzled, \"What's scented meat?\" Indeed, Marty. Indeed.) He's an enormously stylish writer and, together with director Cary Fukunaga, he created a gorgeously immersive universe.\n\nBut True Detective is still a detective show, and it devoted a lot of real estate to its central mystery, which ultimately led to little more than \"a monster in the woods did it.\" Little things that seemed like clues \u2014 the repetitions of five figures standing in a circle, the now notorious \"yellow king\" business, the mystical chattering from various witnesses \u2014 just sort of turned out to mean \"a bunch of crazy people used to do crazy, monstrous stuff out in the woods.\" Certainly, the false resolution to the case in 1995 allowed for a couple of critical character moments, particularly Rust saving Marty from being prosecuted for blowing a guy's head off in anger. But an awful lot of time was spent mucking around with some pretty cliched visions of drug dealers who sort of had nothing to do with anything.\n\nI don't think Pizzolatto cared at all about the drug stuff in the early-middle part of the show, which is why those episodes got so slack and dull. The personal stories at that time weren't at their best, either; they were focused on Marty's affair and his violent beating of a guy who made the mistake of being with a woman Marty believed he owned. Other than the heavily hyped long take at the end of the fourth episode that wound its way through the disastrous undercover operation, the show didn't really make a lot of headway between the end of the pilot and the fifth episode, at which point it became more about the complicated interplay between Marty and Rust, and thus became instantly more interesting. In the end, it was gripping in the pilot, slow in episodes 2 to 4, terrific in episodes 5 to 7, and very ordinary in the finale.\n\nWhat True Detective felt, in the end, was unedited. It felt like it needed another pass, where someone could have told Pizzolatto when Rust was tipping over from an intriguing portrait into a caricature, and when there needed to be a little more story in the story.\n\nPizzolatto told Alan Sepinwall after the finale that to believe Rust is full of it is to believe Nietzsche is full of it:\n\nFor people who thought Cohle's philosophy was simply hogwash, be aware that you're calling Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche hogwash. Just be aware of that. That is not, in fact, a college freshman stoned eating a pizza talking about life; that's Arthur Schopenhauer's thoughts on life.\n\nWith all due respect to Pizzolatto's commitment to great philosophers, college freshmen have, in fact, been known to get stoned, eat pizza, quite correctly quote Nietzsche, and still be utterly full of patoot. The issue was never whether the substance of Rust's philosophy was invalid; it was whether Rust's way of talking about it felt more sophisticated or more affected \u2014 more like a philosopher or more like a dialogue writer. The very long \"time is a flat circle\" conversation, for instance, amounted to a very long interpretation of the idea of history repeating itself, which, without more, isn't something one necessarily needs to hear a character explain in great detail while the show surrounds it with indicators of portent.\n\nKept in perspective, as a very uneven but ultimately highly creative passion project that features some of the best acting you'll see on any screen of any size this year, True Detective is entirely successful. What it isn't is great. To make great television is to understand its episodic structure and to pace it properly. To make a great mystery is to make the conclusion seem like a culmination of the work that has gone into the solution rather than a sense that time expired, so the monster on the hook at the time the music stops is as good a solution to the mystery as any other.\n\nWe'd be lucky to have more showrunners as ambitious as Pizzolatto was about trying to say something about good and evil and philosophy, and certainly to have directors as skilled as Fukunaga at creating memorable visuals. But there turned out to be less here than sometimes met the eye, and in the end, a lot of evidentiary traps were set and never sprung.", "385": "Brilliant, weird noir series True Detective had its season finale last night, and the ending probably wasn\u2019t what most viewers expected. There were a lot of problems with the way this mystery was resolved, but the show did do one thing gloriously right. Spoilers ahead!\n\nI\u2019m going to start with what I consider to be the season finale\u2019s master stroke.\n\nGOOD: The Ending Didn\u2019t Answer All Our Questions\n\nWhat I loved about this episode was that all the most elaborate theories that fans spun out turned out to be wrong. The series didn\u2019t become meta-commentary about how we\u2019re all trapped in a narrative, nor did we ever discover the true meanings of Carcosa and the Yellow King. Instead, it turned out that the guy killing kids was indeed (as we suspected for at least two episodes) Errol Childress, a schizophrenic child molester who had himself been abused as a child. He was working with a few friends who were also child molesters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get all freaked out and start yelling at me that THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER MEANINGS \u2014 yes, I grant you that, and I will talk about them in a second. But for now, just sit back and consider that if you simply look at what the story gave us, we are left with absolutely no explanation for why Errol and his buddies were obsessed with Carcosa and the Yellow King. Why the antlers and the spirals and stick pyramids? There is no explanation other than Errol\u2019s insanity. We do see a gloriously spooky Yellow King in Errol\u2019s murder cave, and Rust hallucinates Carcosa (I loved that moment), but we never find out who came up with this imagery or what it means. It just gets explained away in one line about \u201cchild molesters into voodoo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also never truly find out how many members of the Tuttle/Childress clan are involved in the child sacrifice rituals. When Rust frets about this in the hospital after he and Marty have caught and killed Errol, Marty basically tells him to shut up. Of course the evil men in power weren\u2019t caught, he says to Rust. \u201cThat ain\u2019t what kind of world it is,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut we got ours.\u201d\n\nBasically, this part of the ending was perfect. Nothing is resolved, and that\u2019s true to the realist spirit of the series.\n\nIt also served as an example of Rust\u2019s nihilist philosophy. There is no meaning in anything. It\u2019s all just a bunch of sentient meatsacks repeating the horrors they\u2019ve experienced over and over. Looked at in that way, it was the perfect nose-thumbing at fans who searched like crazy for deeper meanings in this story. Humans are doomed to look for meaning where none exists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s where the episode went terribly wrong.\n\nBAD: The White Trash Villain\n\nFor a show that has been so nuanced and smart about how Louisiana\u2019s downfall is the result of powerful men abusing its citizens, this ending was about as stupid as you can get when it comes to politics. In an earlier episode, we learned that serial killer Errol was basically the product of the abusive Sam Tuttle, father to a political dynasty that spans government, the church and law enforcement. We also know he was victimized by his father, his face burned when he was a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo underscore how much Errol is still a part of this powerful family, we discovered in last night\u2019s episode that he\u2019s living in what seems to be a broken-down mansion, possibly even the old Tuttle estate, and his crimes have been covered up with the help of his powerful family \u2014 some of whom participate in this death rituals.\n\nAnd yet when we finally do see Errol in his element, he\u2019s collapsed down into the worst kind of caricature of white trash. I felt like I was watching Redneck Zombies, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, that episode of X-Files with the two brothers who keep their mother under the bed. The episode begins with him telling his \u201cdaddy,\u201d who is tied up mostly naked in a shack, that he might bring him water if he\u2019s good. Then he traipses over to his mansion, speaking in a variety of accents for no discernible reason, to have sex with his sister in piles of filth. His body and his sister\u2019s body are displayed for the camera as the ultimate grotesques, and later when Marty explores their mansion it\u2019s clear that we are meant to feel nauseated by these hoarder scum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt felt as if the entire series had been building up to a real revelation about the rottenness at the heart of Louisiana, but instead we just got this impoverished guy having sex with his sister and acting out the perfect stereotype of poor Southern whites. Instead of a political or even a spiritual explanation for the murders, we\u2019re basically told that this is just what trash does. They\u2019re just crazy and disgusting. Sure, their awfulness is connected to the tidied-up nastiness of the Tuttles, but we never actually see the Reverend Tuttle traipsing about semi-naked fucking his sister.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that I think Rust and Marty should have busted the whole Tuttle clan. That\u2019s not realistic, and I\u2019m glad the show insisted on reminding us that rich criminals don\u2019t come to justice. What I mean is that ultimately the horrors we\u2019ve seen, and the Carcosa death art, are all ultimately traced back to Errol\u2019s handiwork. His mind has spawned this horror, and his voice haunts the Yellow King\u2019s shrine.\n\nWe are left with an image of Errol\u2019s maimed, obese body and filth-encrusted house as the source of all the series\u2019 darkness. This feels much too simple, and too pat. Previous episodes gave us such inventive, subtle and realistic examples of horror, from a perverted justice system to a charter school system that churns out ignorant children. Instead of giving us a meaty, complex villain whose name might well be \u201cLouisiana,\u201d this season finale gave us an absurd, fantastical stereotype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvil, this episode suggests, is white trash crossed with voodoo religion. Somehow, the victims of Louisiana\u2019s power elite became the perpetrators in this episode. It feels like a betrayal of everything that came before.\n\nBAD: The Happy Ending\n\nAs I said earlier, I can forgive the show for never explaining any of the elaborate symbols of the five beer can people and M-Brane theory and obscure 19th century weird fiction. I think it\u2019s a bold way to spank the audience for trying to make meaning out of the void. Plus, there are a zillion productive ways people can analyze what the Yellow King and Carcosa meant, and how it ties into the Tuttle Ministries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t need a tidy \u201cthis is what it all meant\u201d ending to enjoy all the visual references and literary analogies in this series. In fact, a pat ending would shut down symbols whose power comes from their very ambiguity.\n\nThat said, the writer/director pair of Nic Pizzolatto and Cary Joji Fukunaga made a seriously bizarre decision to end this season happily, with suicidal pessimist Rust finally seeing the light. Literally. We get a final speech from him about how when he was in a coma he felt the texture of a new kind of darkness beneath the other darkness \u2014 the \u201cform\u201d in the void perhaps \u2014 and felt the pure love of his dead daughter there. And now, when he looks at the darkness of the night sky with its sparse spray of illuminated stars, he believes \u201cthe light is winning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause . . . why? I get that he\u2019s resolved this major problem that\u2019s been plaguing him for a decade, and that he\u2019s repaired his (actually pretty adorable) relationship with Marty. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gotten some relief from his sense that life is meaningless. He even got to cry in a manly way with Marty. But this ending feels tacked on, and not in an ironic way.\n\nI am a big proponent of character arcs that show us how people change over time. But this transformation feels like what happens in the final moments of horror movies when the characters escape from the demon in the caves, or the monster in their dreams, or the serial killers in the woods, and suddenly the birds are singing and the police are there to rescue them and a stagey mood of relief pours over everyone as the credits roll.\n\nI think a semi-legitimate argument could be made that this ending is kind of like the fakey-fake happy ending of Blue Velvet, where the mechanical bird sings outside the sitcom-colored kitchen after everybody has been raped and nearly murdered, etc. If that was Pizzolatto and Fukunaga\u2019s intent, it didn\u2019t really work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis show was weird emo gothic, not irony-laced postmodernism. There\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t have been both, but it wasn\u2019t. I think a lot of us responded intensely to True Detective because it was so incredibly earnest. That\u2019s what made it heartbreaking and involving. Regardless of whether the happy ending was intended seriously or ironically, it sold out a show whose intentions were pure and whose characters sought justice in their own personal hells.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to class True Detective\u2019s first season with so many other shows that were great until the final episode(s) and then lost their way. I still love this show, but I would have preferred no ending at all to this one.", "386": "LACEY TERRELL/HBO\n\nListen to our True Detective Spoiler Special, in which our critics debate the season finale:\n\nTwo weeks ago, I wrote a piece about True Detective\u2019s relationship to its female characters, in which I argued that the superficial and sometimes exploitative way that it treated the women who appeared on the show\u2014prostitutes, corpses, mistresses, a nagging wife\u2014was intentional, a reflection of its heroes\u2019 blinkered worldview and the very masculine, Southern cop culture they inhabited, and not the show\u2019s own perspective.\n\nWelp.\n\nWilla Paskin Willa Paskin is Slate\u2019s television critic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLast night\u2019s finale made a hash of my case. Would that it had not. The series was not oblivious to questions of female representation\u2014the show\u2019s writer and creator Nic Pizzolatto has said as much\u2014but women remained ancillary to the end. The women who appeared in the finale were Errol Childress\u2019s damaged half-sister, a backwoods creature in lust to Errol\u2014a man who, despite being a horrifying monster, was shown to be more than adequate at pleasuring her\u2014and also Marty\u2019s family, who appeared at his hospital bed, mostly as an excuse to give us a long close-up on Marty\u2019s sobbing face. Like almost all the supporting characters on this show, the women were just sketches\u2014occasionally naked ones\u2014compared to our full-bodied detectives. The show\u2019s major crimes involved endemic brutality against women and children, and victims is all that the women of this show remained, people against whom various wrongs were committed.\n\nNo TV show has an obligation to be everything to everyone. True Detective is a series I admired and enjoyed, and its treatment of women is not even the thing that irked me most about the finale, which left a number of niggling questions unanswered and finished on a \"let there be light\" riff. But it\u2019s worth lingering on True Detective\u2019s woman problem in part because that problem is closely, if not intentionally, tied to the show\u2019s massive success: When it comes to prestige TV, there has yet to be a downside to out-bro-ing yourself.\n\nIn eight short weeks, True Detective has been granted greatest-show-on-television status on an extremely accelerated schedule. I understand why: McConaughey and Harrelson have been outstanding, their characters indelible. It looks great. It has been enticingly plotted, bread crumbs of Carcosa thick on the ground. If Rust\u2019s banter hewed toward the dorm room, it felt authentically dorm-room: pretentious, sure, but also intelligent. And yet, there are other shows out there that traverse much of the same territory as True Detective\u2014Top of the Lake, The Americans, Broadchurch, The Fall, to name a few\u2014and none of them have gotten the frenzied attention of True Detective. None of those shows are on HBO. None of them feature movie stars. None of them seem explicitly built to appeal to Reddit users. But also\u2014not unrelatedly\u2014they are about women.\n\nLast week, Mo Ryan published a piece about the number of dramas for premium cable that have been made by women. The number is completely laughable (except that it made me want to cry). Premium cable dramas, the prestige category par excellence, are shows created by men that are largely about men, the rare exceptions\u2014Buffy, Battlestar Galactica, and Homeland\u2014only proving the rule. (See also Brett Martin\u2019s Difficult Men, a history of the recent golden age of television that makes this point with its title.) The \u201cbest dramas of all time,\u201d that four-way race between Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos, with Deadwood or Twin Peaks or Buffy tossed in for variety on occasion, are all exceedingly male shows, playing around with male-centric cop, mobster, and druglord genres.\n\nTrue Detective slots into the great drama conversation because it, too, is a great-looking, beautifully acted show that expands upon genre pleasures with very heady themes. But it also takes the machismo even further. The antihero may be played out, but he is an indictment of a certain kind of masculinity. We are drawn to Walter White and Tony Soprano (and Frank Underwood for that matter) even though we know we should be disgusted by them. Antihero shows are an enactment of unthinking hero worship, one that implicates its audience. But Rust and Marty are not antiheroes, whatever Rust says about being a \u201cbad man.\u201d They are just heroes. In the visual language of the finale, Rust is basically Jesus Christ. True Detective is not an interrogation of masculinity, it is a celebration of one, with none of the squishy girl stuff getting in the way. (There is no conversation to have about how the viewers of True Detective wrongly disparaged Maggie in the way that Breaking Bad fans misogynistically denigrated Skyler because True Detective never even let Maggie be enough of a character to get in Marty or Rust\u2019s way.)", "387": "Now that the mystery of the Yellow King is solved, \u201cTrue Detective\u201d fans are turning their attention to figuring out the path for the show\u2019s journey to season two.\n\nAt present, creator Nic Pizzolatto is said to be hunkered down writing scripts for the second season at his home in a picturesque area of Ventura County.\n\nHBO execs have said they intend to order a second season of the anthology series, which will return with new characters and a new mystery to unravel. Speculation about the possible casting for the next batch of episodes is running rampant online, but those in the know say the plan is to wait until a script or two is completed before going out to actors.\n\nAs for the focus of the second season, Pizzolatto has been mostly mum but he dropped a good-sized hint in an interview following Sunday\u2019s finale with Hitfix\u2019s Alan Sepinwall.\n\n\u201cThis is really early, but I\u2019ll tell you (it\u2019s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,\u201d he told Hitfix.\n\nPizzolatto and execs at HBO and Anonymous Content, which co-produced the series with HBO, are expected to powwow this week to hammer out more details.", "388": "Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister \u201crape club\u201d\u2014a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows. \u201cTrue Detective\u201d also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.\n\nWell, as of the finale, I\u2019ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle\u2019s monologues weren\u2019t window dressing. They were the whole point\u2014but I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man\u2014a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars\u2014was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie \u201cCold Comfort Farm\u201d (\u201cI saw something nasty in the woodshed!\u201d). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious \u201cX-Files\u201d episode \u201cHome,\u201d but after that everything went downhill.\n\nTo summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed \u201cChain of command!\u201d). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust\u2019s argument that Marty should be blamed for \u201cpushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.\u201d (Of course, Maggie couldn\u2019t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty\u2019s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell. \u201cErrol\u201d was behind all the show\u2019s central crimes: he\u2019d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he\u2019d helped organize the \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family\u2014although I haven\u2019t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThere was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading \u201cForgiven!\u201d And, over the show\u2019s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of \u201cLost,\u201d the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was \u201cfine, just fine,\u201d recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).\n\nI am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show\u2019s gross-out victims\u2014the dead \u201cprosts,\u201d the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty\u2019s own screwed-up daughter\u2014were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn\u2019t \u201caverted their eyes\u201d to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We\u2019re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can\u2019t pull that off.\n\nAs I said in the review, it\u2019s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I\u2019ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people\u2019s view of the other television that\u2019s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like \u201cTop of the Lake\u201d and \u201cThe Fall,\u201d as well as \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d \u201cSpiral,\u201d \u201cThe Returned,\u201d and the terrific new season of \u201cThe Americans\u201d\u2014varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d in part because they didn\u2019t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d is on its way, and so is \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Fingers crossed that there\u2019s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities! Just spare me anything atmospheric: I\u2019ve had enough hot air.", "389": "This review discusses plot points from the full run of True Detective in detail.\n\n\u201cThe light is winning,\u201d True Detective\u2019s Rust concedes at the end of the HBO hit\u2019s first season. Or it\u2019s got the momentum, at least, even if the deficit displayed on the scoreboard remains monumental. After seven-plus hours of his paeans to darkness and the inexorable pointlessness and tragedy of human existence, Rust\u2019s closing line throws everything that came before it into a very different, well, light.\n\nA number of critics (including on this site) find fault with that last-second reversal, labeling it a betrayal or holding it as emblematic of the show\u2019s ultimate punt on many of the big questions of power, corruption, violence, and institutions\u2019 control of individuals that it had seemed to raise. But it\u2019s worth setting the question of whether or not True Detective kept its thematic promises aside for at least a moment to appreciate the technical craftsmanship of the storytelling that brings Rust through the improbable arc.\n\nTrue Detective is built around binary relationships \u2014 optimist and pessimist, cop and crook, faithful and bereft. The usefulness and failings of these binaries are a recurring background presence in the season, and in some ways the show has more to say about binaries than it does about any of its plot-level ideas. Rust\u2019s concession (or perhaps it\u2019s a revelation of some long-lit and tightly guarded spark of optimism in him, which could explain why a committed pessimist who\u2019s bad at parties would bother not just to bear witness to the \u201craw deal\u201d nature\u2019s offered humankind, but to be police, to be one of the bad men who keep other bad men from the door) is a shift in one of these binaries, and it\u2019s worth examining it specifically to think about the broader structure that drove the HBO hit\u2019s first season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout True Detective\u2019s first season, creator Nic Pizzolato relies upon two combating shapes: the open spiral and the closed circle. \u201cTime is a flat circle,\u201d in Rust\u2019s idle (and meme-friendly) philosophizing, and Pizzolatto\u2019s camera finds visual examples of that closed loop notion in highway interchanges and the bottoms of Lone Star tallboys and the drum magazine on Reggie Ledoux\u2019s AK-47. Spirals adorn Childress\u2019 victims and one is scarred into his own flesh just below the nape of his neck \u2014 a location that means someone else had to have carved the shape into his body \u2014 to say nothing of the spiral-ish labyrinth that hosts his final showdown with our heroes. If the dominant geometry of human history and experience is Rust\u2019s \u201cflat circle\u201d \u2014 where everything repeats, where free will is an illusion, where humanity marches witlessly around some sort of existential grindstone \u2014 then fighting crime and catching bad guys and mourning our long-dead toddlers is all pointless playacting.\n\nThe spiral, on the other hand, makes for a more hopeful metaphor for existence. Whether they collapse inward or wind outward from their centers, spirals suggest progress from one state to another, implying an uncertain future that can be influenced by present action. The intoxicating nihilism of Rust\u2019s \u201cflat circle\u201d speech and the abstract brutality of the largely-unseen cultists for whom the spiral is a unifying symbol suggest there\u2019s only one assessment of which notion of human existence is right and which is evil.\n\nBy converting Rust from a despairing advocate of circular history to a reluctant adherent to the heartening, spiraling idea that light has been bringing the universe closer and closer to a tie ballgame, True Detective reverses its original stance on this symbolic stand-in for philosophical inquiry.\n\nWe know the symbolic reversal of that moral binary matters a great deal, since symbolism is so essential to how True Detective works. The show is rampant with the stuff, and its leads are walking symbols of diametrically opposed values systems. The DNA of each man\u2019s worldview is on hardly-veiled display in their very names. \u201cRust Cohle,\u201d the corrosive and elemental force of brute rationalism, rendering life\u2019s mysteries into plain inevitabilities of time and force, in the same way the earth\u2019s internal forces turn carbon into coal. \u201cMarty Hart,\u201d whose gut goes slack in retirement, the heart-driven man who turns into Fat Marty, Mardi Gras, the guiltless intuiter and womanizer who\u2019s good with people and great at the version of grade-school show-and-tell that adults call happy hour. Here, too, Pizzolatto organizes his clearest symbolic language within a binary structure, while also choosing one that is marked by classic cultural ideas of manhood and its rightful place in society.\n\nMore broadly, binaries are easy for an audience, and here they created a very engaging playground. But binaries are also simplistic and deceptive. The masculine binary that animates True Detective crowded out a lot of the shadowy complexity that attends real-world institutional conspiracies around power, murder, and sex. It also seems to flatter some classic cultural notions about strong, tough, brooding men being both rightful arbiters of good and evil and sufficient protection from the latter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn choosing to locate his story within the Rust-Marty dynamic, Pizzolatto foreclosed a great many possibilities including that of female characters who are fully human or who demonstrate agency outside of how their lives collide with the menfolk they orbit. The space Pizzolatto clears with his choices gets allocated to spooky atmospherics and layers of conspiracy that implicate the most powerful political and religious figures in True Detective\u2019s Louisiana in a drug-fueled ritual-based murder and pedophilia cult cobbled together from scraps of mainline Christianity and transgressive literary traditions. Other shows that handle similar subject matter have made very different choices about how to approach incest and violence against women and provoked very different kinds of contemplation. Taken together, art like Top of the Lake and The Fall and August: Osage Countyand True Detective serve as patches in a quilt of ideas about those subjects.\n\nSome of those patches approach this material with a sure and settled viewpoint and find the right characters to bring that viewpoint to fierce and even triumphant life. Others function more as mirrors than as declarations, and I\u2019d argue True Detective is one of these. Those old, flawed ideas about hard men keeping us as safe as we are docile and loyal that Rust represents? The show\u2019s resolution calls all of them into question, as they fail to net any of the powerful men and institutions that were participating in the Carcosa cult and settle for destroying only its most prolific member. Those binary notions of how we should be and how we should view our species and our place in space-time get dislodged by the show\u2019s conclusion. It isn\u2019t that the spirals vs. circles, Marty vs. Rust, good vs. evil dynamics get resolved in surprising ways, it\u2019s that they prove irresolvable and false by the time it\u2019s all over. Rather than endorsing one or another clear or doctrinaire worldview or conception of reality, True Detective suggests its best to lean on a pastiche of many different elements, in much the same way that Adam Gopnik recently argued that the rump plurality of non-atheist non-religious people have set out to do for themselves in defiance of the self-appointed authority of both Pope Francis and Richard Dawkins alike.\n\n\u201cThis world is a veil,\u201d the revival-tent preacher with the Elvis haircut says in one early-season episode. As it turns out, that idea is a better representation of what True Detective has to say about human nature than anything. The spirals and circles, crowns and Yellow Kings, philosophizers and affable broskis are all feints at an orderliness that the real world never actually exhibits on its own. We think we\u2019re making sense of the world around us, but we\u2019ve made it into a veil that is legible to high-functioning animal neurology built to identify important patterns or to create them where none exist. The questions we think are worth asking and the binaries that seem worth organizing your life around prove useless.", "390": "Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, True Detective\u2019s finale, titled \u201cForm and Void,\u201d took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction \u2014 as well as the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse. It was a tale that ripped dark marks on our bellies, then soothed us by \u201cmaking flowers\u201d on us. So to speak.\n\nWe start on the outskirts of the infernal plane. We begin in hell on earth. The ersatz underworld of The Yellow King \u2014 a.k.a. Errol Childress, a perverse product of paternal abuse, generational evil, and his own deranged, pop-culture informed myth-making \u2014 was a theater of the mind for a fantasy made real: His vision of Carcosa, the necropolis of Ambrose Bierce and the fallen world of Robert W. Chambers, littered with dead trees and body bags. Childress lured Cohle into his ascension chamber \u2014 the staging area for so many murders, and last night, a stage for an ancient ritual, the oldest story of all. Light versus dark. Good versus evil. \u201cLittle priest\u201d versus wannabe Elder God. It was The Real World: Dungeons and Dragons, and Cohle, hard boiled to the core, was ready to play. I\u2019ll see your abyss and gaze right back, Lawnmower Man!\n\nHe was fooling himself. Rust Cohle has always been fooling himself. His cynicism, his callousness were parts of the mask he wore to engage the world, to deal with himself. But it offered no protection when his mind \u2014 tweaking from the fetid evil around him \u2014 conspired against him and waylaid him with a vision of a coal-black vortex spiraling down to claim him. Maybe you were thinking: They\u2019re going to do it! Cthulhu is coming! Coming to take us away, ha-ha! Ho-ho! Hee-hee! Beam me up, Lovecraft!\n\nBut no. It was gotcha moment, for Rust, and for us. Childress seized him and cut him to the core, literally and spiritually, like a knife to an empty can of Lone Star. \u201cTAKE OFF YOUR MASK!\u201d The Monster bellowed. It was as if Childress was telling him to cut the phony bologna nihilist crap, the useful fairy tale of baggy and buggy sentient meat denying his truth. Of course, you can say the same of his agent of enlightenment, his doppelganger. True Detective was always all about authenticity \u2014 or rather, the lack thereof, and the stories we tell ourselves to get us through the day (religion, or nothingness, or our private Carcosas) and in turn imprint (and inflict) upon the world.\n\nWhat happened after Rust\u2019s gutting exposes us as well: the final 15 minutes of \u201cForm and Void\u201d struck me as a Rorschach test for what you want from stories like this, for what we\u2019ve come to call \u201cresolution,\u201d And boy, did we get a lot of it, both implied and explicitly stated, no more so during the last scene, with all of its mansplaining and bromantic uplift. Yes, uplift. The twist ending of True Detective\u2019s bleak first season: a bracing refutation of its baroque pessimism. Cohle and Hart slayed the decadently dandy slumdog (schizo?) psycho at dream\u2019s end, spent a good chunk of time processing their feelings and baring their souls, then exited, stage right, to star in The Odd Couple sitcom we\u2019ll never get to see. They were as stunned by this turn of events as we were. Cohle and Hart, flawed heroes and failed men, expected to be destroyed by their bid to pay the debt they owed the world, and so did I. If you had told me four episodes ago, after Rust\u2019s ugly Crash digression and Marty\u2019s complete unraveling, that we\u2019d get a happy ending in which they\u2019d be laughing and hugging and telling stories about the stars \u2014 like myth-making bards of antiquity \u2014 I would have thought you were a sauce-knackered tent preacher. What does say that about me? Perhaps a lifetime spent consuming stories has shaped my imagination to assume the worst. Or maybe I\u2019m just, like, a really hideous person.\n\nAnd so instead of losing their lives, Cohle and Hart were rewarded with new life. Marty found a little redemption \u2014 but not too much \u2014 and reconciliation he thought beyond him. Rust found some catharsis for the past, triggered by a near-death experience as his sense of self was becoming incoherent and fading away: A feeling of love and connection with his dead daughter and his beloved father. He wanted to sink and dissipate into that deep: \u201cI said, \u2018Darkness, yeah! [Instant classic McConaughey-ism!] And then I woke up,\u201d said Cohle, despairing that what felt so metaphysically real was only a dream. Still, in this moment, we truly saw Cohle for the first time: He shed his last layer to reveal the profound grief that drove him. Wow. I thought we would get a grim and gritty climax that affirmed a gloomy worldview; we thought we would get Chinatown. Instead, we got the deconstruction of hipster/pulp cynicism that says heroism is a crock and the recovery of old school virtue; we got Casablanca.\n\nA toast to Cohle and Hart, who deserve to be the penultimate* final statement on an era of anti-heroism and hideous men: Here\u2019s to the beginning of a beautiful relationship.\n\n*I think Don Draper should get the final word on this, don\u2019t you?\n\nTHE FASCINATION WITH ABOMINATION\n\nIn which we spend a few hundred words making sense of The Yellow King.\n\nWe won\u2019t be forgetting Errol Childress anytime soon. The collaboration of writing, directing, set and performance (Glenn Fleshler, terrific) in \u201cForm and Void\u201d combined to produce a memorable portrait of decadent, demented evil that was rich with layers and allusions and subtext.\n\nThe facts, as I understood them. Errol made his home in the boonies beyond the Creole Nature Trail. He kept his dead father \u2014 another lawless lawman and corrupt Tuttle, who with other Tuttles abused him and warped him and sewed his psyche with their perverse private religion \u2014 bound and lip-tied. He kept house with his half-sister. Made \u201cflowers\u201d on her, too. (Ewww.) He had stacks and stacks of books, magazines and DVDs in his trashed, fly-swarmed, fetid home. (Was The King In Yellow somewhere in those stacks?) He watched a lot of TV. (That was North by Northwest on the telly.) He was a man of many voices \u2014 Andy Griffith, Slingblade, James Mason \u2014 and seemingly no fixed identity.\n\nBut the intelligence behind those masks did fancy itself something monstrous. Errol lived to make his mark on the world by abducting and raping and killing children in ritualistic fashion with the help of his low-life cousins \u2014 his \u201cacolytes\u201d \u2014 the Ledoux brother, and littering the landscape with devil nets, occult graffiti, a Christian woman slain and transmogrified into an art object that mocked her faith. All were ironic reminders that evil roamed the land with impunity, and no one could \u2014 or would \u2014 stop him. Certainly not God. It bothered Errol, though, that no one had detected his handiwork: \u201cOh, if they had eyes to see,\u201d he said. The implication: Errol wanted to be discovered. What\u2019s more, he wanted to expose the family that had made him, that used him, that\u2026 worshipped him? And then there was the matter of Errol\u2019s last great project: His \u201cascension.\u201d He made a reference to tying off the endless loop of his life \u2014 his own circle of violence and degradation \u2014 and checking out \u2014 \u201cI am near the final stage. Some mornings, I can see the infernal plane.\u201d\n\nI am taken by the notion that Errol wanted to end his life by producing a story \u2014 his last ritual \u2014 in which he would play the part of The Great Adversary. He just needed some worthy Hero-Christs to play their parts in the play. He finally got them \u2014 after years of waiting? \u2014 in the form of Cohle and Hart. In that moment in the field, when Cohle told Errol to freeze, and Errol said \u201cNo,\u201d Errol wanted the detectives to follow him into his labyrinth. A grand battle ensued \u2014 Errol wasn\u2019t going to make it easy; our boys had to earn it \u2014 and Errol got his death-wish made true by Cohle, no stranger to death-wishes. Cohle shot him in the head, and the image we got framed Errol\u2019s exploding head within the hole in the roof of his chamber. Behold Errol\u2019s violent enlightenment, his ascension, his storytelling mission accomplished.\n\nOf the many details that defined Errol, I am thinking most at present about all that pop culture lying around his house. Errol\u2019s story concluded one of True Detective\u2019s themes/morals: Be careful what you put in your head. You spend your days filling your head with pictures of evil (Cohle, ep. 3), you spend your days filling your imagination with faces of evil and stories about evil (Errol, and his Carcosa-crazed family, Hitchcock flicks, and who knows what else Errol kept lying around), you spend your days fascinated with abomination, and chances are, they\u2019re going to affect the way you see the world.\n\n+++\n\nHeading into the finale, I saw several pieces lobbying for a \u201cno resolution\u201d ending to True Detective. No hard answers, no final declarations. Resist the desire to be just like any other cop show! Their argument was that True Detective wasn\u2019t really about the murders and rapes and the ritualistic desecration of children and women, wasn\u2019t really about its mysteries of history and corruption and secrets and lies. It was about the characters of Cohle and Hart, and their charged bromance, and Cohle\u2019s ridiculous philosophizing, and Hart being a dork, and the world, and the landscape, and the existential unknowability of absolute truth and the mood \u2014 oh, the gloriously fetid mood.\n\nI respectfully disagree. It\u2019s a misread of the story to argue that True Detective has always been resolution-agnostic, that it should have given us an ending with question marks instead of periods. The first six episodes were narratively driven by Cohle and Hart\u2019s storytelling, but we see now \u2014 and this is important and not to be overlooked \u2014 that the story was always framed by two detectives searching for truth: Papania and Gilbough, who we now know to be righteous, honorable cops. The portraits of Cohle and Hart that emerged depicted obsolete modes of masculinity and worldviews, who were unworthy of the heroism that was required of them \u2014 but became so by submitting to total deconstruction.\n\nThe last two episodes saw Cohle and Hart taking responsibility for a broken world that they helped to break. I loved how this was expressed in the procedural scenes, and I was grateful we got a lot of them in the past two weeks. It was great seeing the detectives actually be detectives \u2014 especially diligent, thorough Hart, who made the key connection that put them in the road to Childress. Even Cohle was impressed: \u201cF\u2014 you, man!\u201d High praise!\n\nBottom line: The organizing principle of True Detective was restoring law to a lawless land. Telling me to not care about that \u2014 to not want resolution for that \u2014 is to be cynical about character transformation. It asks me to not care about justice. And that\u2019s what \u201cresolution\u201d meant here: justice. There is a kind of existential pulp that can get away with moral ambiguity (Breaking Bad), or supernatural existentialism that can get away without explaining its metaphysics (Lost). This was neither.\n\nYes, it was earnest. It certainly defied common medical sense: How the hell did Rust survive that gutting? Dude plunged that blade deep into his belly, lifted him off the ground and let him hang and tear a little on its jagged edge. Ouch! But it was interesting how the final 15 minutes gave us a series of very distinct scenes, each representing a different kind of ending that could have worked for both this story and this kind of story, yet worked together to create another meaning altogether:\n\nDo you like your pulp colder than Jack Nicholson\u2019s naughty bits at the end of The Shining? Then remember forever Hart cradling Cohle \u2014 both bleeding to death \u2014 looking up into the empty eye of God formed by the opening in the ceiling in Childress\u2019 ascension chamber, seeing a flare \u2014 a flicker of hope \u2014 and crying out: \u201cHere! We\u2019re here!\u201d Basically: The Book of Job, before the restoration.\n\nDo you prefer some resolution but not complete resolution? Then remember forever our fallen warriors in the hospital: Hart reunited with family, suddenly feeling healed, then remembering he is not, that his encounter with horror has left him far afield from anything like \u201cfine.\u201d And Cohle, looking hollowed and husked \u2014 a grizzled, lost Frodo after his awful apocalypse at Mount Doom.\n\nDo you need happy ending uplift? Then remember forever Hart coaching Cohle toward hope and stars, and Cohle tearfully recognizing that his protest-too-much nihilism has been so much sound and fury, and both men hobbling away, arm in arm.\n\nTaken together, all those scenes created a nuanced climax. Kudos to True Detective for not making too much of Cohle and Hart\u2019s heroic achievement. Yes, it felt mythic, but that\u2019s because we got a climax set in The Yellow King\u2019s fraudulent \u201cpsychosphere,\u201d and most of it from Cohle\u2019s muddled perspective. Cohle the Pulp Christ so wanted the grandiose knock-out punch \u2014 what a way to go out, to tie off the vicious circle of violence and degradation, both in himself and in his culture; to solve the problem of evil once and for all! (Take THAT, Silent God!) But Hart corrected him, right-sized him; that was not their job, not their fight, and really, nothing they were qualified for. This small chapter of the never-ending story was more than enough and screwed them up good. Leave the rest to the next generation. Leave it to the duly empowered (and totally righteous) Gilbough and Papania.\n\nAnd this why I loved that True Detective let Cohle and Hart live \u2014 or rather, made them live. Their \u201crewards\u201d for saving the day? Shredded illusions. Painful self awareness. The opportunity to spend all of their remaining years trying to get over the horror, the horror. The only real feel-good compensations? They get each other; they get to figure their sh\u2013 out together. My favorite parts of the finale? When Hart called Cohle his \u201cfriend;\u201d when Cohle entrusted a man he found so easy to judge with this weakness and tears.\n\nYeah, yeah: CORNY. But I buy it. Because it\u2019s true. And I\u2019ll take it from almost any story, flaws and all, if I feel it earned it. And I say True Detective did.", "391": "- Advertisement -\n\nTent preacher Joel Theriot's full sermon from episode three of True Detective provides a preview and explanation of detective Rust Cohle's conversion from a laconic nihilist extraordinaire who can barely live with himself to an enlightened soul with some prospect for peace.\n\nIn episode 7, Cohle laments his long journey through violence and depravity then says I'm ready to tie it off. Many suspected that this forecast death for Cohle in the final episode. In a very real sense, that theory proved correct but it was a different type of death.\n\nAs it turns out, True Detective is the story of a seeker of truth. Rust Cohle's moment of enlightenment in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle's struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room. The seemingly less than sophisticated preacher and an audience of those at the margins of life in rural Louisiana hide the profound message delivered for those willing to listen. Episode 3 shows only a portion of the sermon. The entire sequence is available on YouTube and is well worth watching (several times).\n\nThe sermon represent a narrative map for the broader story told throughout the series, which reaches a climax at the end of the season finale. Of note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity. He both delivers the sermon to and experiences it with the congregation as indicated by their frequent, fervent interaction. There are no strictures, admonitions, or rules; just the presentation of a higher wisdom and path to inner peace available to everyone with ears to hear. Theriot's sermon is in italics along with my comments.\n\nHe saw you in those dark corners. He heard you. Oh brothers, he heard those thoughts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe question, are you there?\n\nSince the death of his daughter, Cohle has suffered unrelenting guilt for failing to protect her. For years, Cohle has been the only person listening to his thoughts. No one else is there. He is alone without comfort.\n\nWould that we had ears to hear, because every moment, every now is an answer. Every beat of every heart, every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day is an answer.\n\nAnd the answer is yes, yes, yes.\n\nTheriot has a forceful answer to the question Are you there? He is and he is with us every moment. But what does he represent. Everything in the scene tells us that he is Jesus. But we don't hear the name Jesus until four minutes into the six-minute sermon. Cohle and partner Marty Hart are seen at the back of the tent watching Theriot preach. Cohle's nonchalant attitude, leaning against the tent post is more than disinterest. It represents contempt from the Cohle we know up to this point. (In the final airing of this episode, he says to Marty: What do you think the average IQ of this crew is? I see a propensity for obesity, poverty and fairy tales.)\n\nYour sorrows pin you to this place. They divide you from what your heart knows. \" We bandaged our soft selves in hardness and anger. You are a stranger to yourself and yet he knows you. And, when your hard heart made you like unto the stone and broke you from his body - which is the stars and the wind between the stars - he knew you. He knew you yet and forever. Because I ask you, how could a father forget his children?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCohle became a stranger to himself as a result of hardness and anger due to the death of his daughter. He was so hardened to the world, so profoundly skeptical and alienated, it broke Cohle from his body; separated him from the embrace and protection of the peace surrounding him at the time of his greatest need.\n\nIf ever your sorrow becomes such a burden that you forget yourself, forget this world, I want you to remember this truth\"\n\nThis world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "392": "by Ed Martin , March 10, 2014\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe effectiveness and overall impact of HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective\u201d -- the first-arc finale of which proved such a draw last night that it crashed HBO Go -- should be a signal to the television industry that there is success to be had in exploring new programming models. Audiences seem less interested in prolonged seasons of any series, especially when they are presented with perpetual preemptions, or in fall and spring seasons with a prolonged break in between. That break is an annoyance that stalls the momentum a show may have built up from September through December or January before the annual scheduling challenges begin.That wasn\u2019t a problem for \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d episodes of which premiered at 9 p.m. ET in mid-January and ran on eight Sundays with only one interruption (to avoid the Super Bowl) but otherwise without concern about such competitive programming blockbusters as the Grammy Awards, the Academy Awards or AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d HBO made one of the smartest scheduling moves in recent memory, running a drama series starring Matthew McConaughey right through an awards season punctuated by his many nominations for his role in the theatrical film \u201cDallas Buyers Club,\u201d not to mention the added benefit of all the interviews and press opportunities that resulted from all the actual awards he received. (I suspect he\u2019ll pick up a couple more for \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d)\n\nThis show ran for only eight episodes -- but they had a running time of approximately one hour each, which roughly equals ten episodes of a broadcast or basic cable series when factoring in time lost to commercial pods. That was just enough to build and maintain interest without the show becoming a chore to stay with, as sometimes happens with even the best series. It also made for easy catch-ups during the season and for comfortable aftermath binges. Eight hours might kill one day, but it won\u2019t destroy a weekend. To look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.\n\nRegardless, series formats and models are suddenly in play as never before. One can forgive anybody who is feeling a sense of confusion about the issue. Perhaps this guide will help, especially as the Upfront season approaches and dozens of networks suddenly dump hundreds of new programs of many kinds into a massive heap that advertisers and critics are supposed to process with unlimited interest. (That worked in the old days of a three- or four-network Upfront, but now May has a madness all its own.)\n\nA mini-series has always been -- and should continue to be -- a one-time closed-ended series that plays over several consecutive nights or weeks. Sundance\u2019s \u201cTop of the Lake\u201d and BBC America\u2019s \u201cFleming\u201d are perfect recent examples, even if they were considerably shorter than such legendary miniseries of the past as \u201cRich Man, Poor Man,\u201d \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cNorth and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue Detective\u201d and FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d are looked upon as mini-series simply because that is the most convenient definition, and I suppose it fits. But each season of \u201cAHS\u201d continues to build an over-arching brand, as I\u2019m certain future seasons of \u201cDetective\u201d will also do. I think these are the true \u201cevent\u201d series of our time, rather than mere \u201cminis,\u201d because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.\n\nOngoing broadcast series that are scheduled outside of the traditional broadcast season -- like CBS\u2019 \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d and \u201cExtant\u201d and Fox\u2019s upcoming \u201c24: Live Another Day\u201d -- are currently being referred to as \u201cevent\u201d series. But as long as they continue season to season with the same characters and continuous story lines they should be regarded as \u201cregular\u201d series -- as they would be on basic and pay cable -- and nothing more. (I haven\u2019t seen it, but I\u2019m already thinking of \u201cLive Another Day\u201d as a ninth season of \u201c24,\u201d rather than some kind of stand-alone \u201cevent,\u201d even if it is only twelve episodes, a dramatic departure from its past model -- which, we shouldn\u2019t forget, had gotten stale).\n\n\u201cRegular\u201d series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways. I consider BBC America\u2019s superb back-from-the-dead drama \u201cIn the Flesh\u201d to be a regular series, because it has seasons that continue the same story lines with the same characters. It matters not that the first season was only three episodes long (which, minus commercial time, comes out to one longish theatrical movie). The same is true of BBC America\u2019s \u201cBroadchurch\u201d and Sundance\u2019s \u201cThe Returned\u201d (a French import) with their eight-episode cycles of ongoing stories or new stories with ongoing characters.\n\nStreaming series like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d are \u201cregular\u201d series masquerading as \u201cevents\u201d because that\u2019s exactly what they are for most people who adjust their lives around them to consume them in their entirety as quickly as possible. So, for now anyway, Netflix gets to have it both ways. I suppose it can be argued that any series anywhere can be gobbled up in so hurried a manner, making anything a potential event, but that\u2019s not the intent of the original scheduling, which still counts for something, or ought to. I don\u2019t think networks are ready to concede that their first-run prime-time real estate is nothing more than a shelf on which to display fresh product intended to be enjoyed at some non-specific future time, like DVDs on a shelf at Target or anything in a Netflix queue.", "393": "So it turns out this live streaming of popular TV programs is harder than it looks.\n\n\u201cWatch now?\u201d True Detective fans said through gritted teeth. \u201cWhy, I\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nViewers who opted to watch Sunday night\u2019s finale of True Detective via HBO Go, the pay channel\u2019s streaming app, were treated to the kind of shocking twist they probably could have done without: The streaming service went belly up shortly after the final episode began airing at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd the reason you couldn\u2019t watch True Detective on HBO Go Sunday night?

HBO really isn\u2019t going to stress about that.\n\nPaying customers, however, may feel differently after Sunday night\u2019s streaming snafu. An article on Hypable (which I spotted thanks to the Washington Post) wonders if it\u2019s not time for HBO to start tightening up the rules for its streaming app, which is available on mobile platforms as well as set-top boxes and gaming consoles. Specifically, the Hypable article suggests that HBO think about restricting the number of people who can log into any one HBO Go account at a given time. After all, this is the second high-profile season finale where HBO GO went belly up\u2014last year\u2019s Game of Thrones season-ender suffered similar issues.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second consecutive weekend in which your plans to stream a popular television broadcast may have gone awry. If you thought finding out the identity of the Yellow King was complicated, you should have tried streaming last week\u2019s Oscar ceremony. Despite limiting the first-ever Oscar live stream to a handful of markets, ABC couldn\u2019t deliver the telecast to viewers tuning in on mobile devices.

Ghost trains? Devil-worshipping conductors? The satanically slow speeds on Amtrak? We\u2019ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn\u2019t so much the plot or the cast\u2014it\u2019s the genre. Season one captured the internet\u2019s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There\u2019s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?\n\nIdea one: \u201870s conspiracy-theory thriller\n\nSeason one had a grand, governmental conspiracy weaved into its plot. Police reports were altered, Louisiana\u2019s Senator was implicated, Rust Cohle was always fighting the system in one way or another. But as the show wound towards its conclusion, the big-picture stuff mostly fell away, and we were left with our two heroes going up against Errol in Carcosa. That\u2019s fine, but why not go full Parallax View next time? Set it wherever you want\u2014Washington, City Hall, some backwater town in Alaska. Get twisty and convoluted, but with that edgy, almost psychedelic element of madness that should come with any paranoia-based thriller. It really just sounds like I\u2019m asking for HBO to produce season two of Rubicon. Well, that\u2019s fine by me.\n\nIdea two: Classic Poe\n\nThe Following did its best to ruin Edgar Allen Poe for everyone by having its chief villain, Joe Carroll, worship the macabre author and base a cult around his writing. His acolytes wandered around in Poe masks setting people on fire, and then Kevin Bacon would show up, point at a crime scene, and say, \u201cClassic Poe.\u201d This offense must be corrected, and while I\u2019m sure Pizzolatto will feel the topic is overplayed, I wish he\u2019d step in to draw from Poe\u2019s writing in a much more thematically appropriate matter. The man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective\u2019s first season.\n\nIdea three: The Wicker Man (but, y\u2019know, good)\n\nSeason one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult. What if next year we just go full pagan? The original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island. A bunch of no-good sex druids immediately start making trouble. It all sounds silly, and Neil LaBute\u2019s horrendous Nicolas Cage-starring remake didn\u2019t help that reputation, but there is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about being stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere. As long as there\u2019s no Smoke Monster.\n\nIdea four: Cyberpunk\n\nAlright, this is as far-fetched as it gets. But a man can dream. If you really want to shake things up, nothing\u2019s further from Carcosa than cyberspace, and there\u2019s plenty of philosophical debate to plunder from the works of William Gibson or Neal Stephenson. Matthew McConaughey is coasting to a career revival partly on the back of True Detective\u2014maybe it\u2019s time for Keanu Reeves to enjoy the same renaissance? I look forward to much talk of \u201cjacking in\u201d and the \u201cMetaverse.\u201d Who am I kidding, there\u2019s more of a chance that season two just ends up being about Rust Cohle and Marty Walsh chasing tail in an old folks home.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.", "395": "It's rare for a television show -- especially a drama that becomes a hit in its first season -- to totally scrap its existing characters and story line to start anew in Season 2. But that's what \"True Detective\" is doing -- at least, that is what it seems to be doing, based on the few clues that show creator Nic Pizzolatto has shared with television critics in recent interviews.\n\nHitFix's Alan Sepinwall notes that HBO hasn't officially ordered Season 2\n\nyet -- again, a stalling that's rare for a hit series so popular that it brings down its hosts site -- but surmises that this is \"because I suspect HBO is waiting until they've signed the actors they want before announcing.\"\n\nThere are a few things we do know about Season 2 of \"True Detective,\" however: Pizzolatto is currently \"fleshing it out,\" he told EW, and it will be about \"hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.\"\n\nAnd the Chicago Tribune claims that Matthew McConaughey, who played detective Rust Cohle alongside Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart, won't be back:\n\nThe show was always intended as an anthology with a new story each season. The surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday. But McConaughey has said he never planned to stay beyond one season. \u201cIt was a 450-page film, is what it was,\u201d McConaughey said of the show's first season during a January Television Critics Association panel. \u201cIt was also finite. It didn't mean we had to come back this year, next year if we were under contract. It was finite. So in that way it was exactly a 450-page film script.\u201d", "396": "\"True Detective\" wraps up the first season with a harrowing (and hopeful) episode.\n\nFor the last few weeks, the internet has been exploding with various theories about \"True Detective.\" There has been everything from think pieces by Andrew Romano at The Daily Beast, wacky fan theories all over the place, and even a wonderful Youtube video about the the Yellow King.\n\nIt's all been a lot of fun to speculate about \"True Detective,\" the monster at the end of its dream and what all of Rust Cohle's philosophical soliloquies are really about. Now that we've reached the end I think many of us missed the point. (Although, I very much agree with Romano's piece about \"True Detective\" being an examination of storytelling and the power of storytelling. But there are a number of subtexts, meta-writing and philosophies at work on this series. It's one of the reasons this first season has been so great.)\n\nNow that's all said and done, I think \"True Detective\" is mainly about our two detectives, Rust and Martin Hart, and how they've changed. Creator Nic Pizzolatto has long said this is solely a story about these two detectives. Now, Pizzolatto uses these protagonists to expound a number of philosophies (Nietzsche and Tom Ligotti's excellent case for the pessimist viewpoint in \"The Conspiracy Against Human Beings\"), literary references (Robert Chambers' \"The King in Yellow\") and ideas about religion that are utterly compelling.\n\nBut for me, Pizzolatto did something amazing by examining the human condition through a focus on two men, and presented an outstanding case for the duality of human nature. As Rust said, \"Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution\" responsible for all the evil in this world. While that's surely a valid point, Rust eventually finds beauty in human consciousness by the end of it all. Human consciousness has the potential for horrible things, but it can also create wonderful, powerful love. Through Rust and Marty, we see the capacity for change. Despite all of Rust's \"Time is a flat circle\" nihilism where nothing changes and \"nothing is solved,\" he does actually change, a lot, over the course of this 17-year story, as does Marty.\n\nFor all the horrors Rust faced in his lifetime - tweakers injecting infant daughters with meth, Medea murdering mothers and the countless terrors from his four-year stint as an undercover Narco - only one thing forever changed him, the love between him and his daughter. Rust became a shell (sentient meat) of a soul after her death, and then found redemption in her undying love. The longer he refused to acknowledge the importance and power of human connection, the more of a toll it took on him mentally (his pessimism) and physically (his alcoholism).\n\nSome folks may complain about his final revelation. That an all-powerful love exists (even after death), and that this is a violation of who Rust was throughout the entire series. But I found it to be both a welcomed \"twist\" and somewhat hopeful ending that conveyed much of the contrasting ideas at play this season. (It also helped that Matthew McConaughey had one of his most powerfully gut-wrenching monologues in that final scene with Marty outside the hospital. Give that man all the awards.)\n\nAnd while Rust had the most dramatic transformation after the showdown with Errol William Childress in Carcosa - more on that below - Marty had a pretty big one too. Marty had always prided himself on his \"steady\" family man status, but had taken that family's love for granted, whether out of selfishness, pain or just obliviousness. Once he's visited by his daughters and ex-wife in the hospital he tries to tell them \"he's okay,\" but he can't lie anymore. He hasn't been okay for a longtime, and maybe if he'd realized it sooner his family would still be in the picture. Now that he has, maybe Marty can begin to make amends and find some peace, at least by being a father.\n\nBoth Rust and Marty were immensely flawed men, though not as much as Reggie Ledoux or Errol. But they did some terrible things. Marty hurt a woman who loved him deeply and alienated his two daughters. If anyone, he epitomized Rust's words about \"The sin of being a father\" and just never realized it. While Rust claimed to have all the answers and was just \"A bad man keeping other bad men form the door,\" he actually wasn't. Rust Cohle was a very damaged person who could've easily given in to the darkness and fallen into the abyss of Carcosa. But he didn't because that love for his daughter and her love for him wouldn't let that happen, even if he only realized it much later.\n\nNow \"True Detective\" ended on a somewhat hopeful notion, even if many of the individuals involved in the Carcosa/Yellow King conspiracy will never be found out or brought to justice, and I'm glad about that. Rust and Marty, and many other people, had to suffer greatly throughout this season of \"True Detective,\" and presenting the power of undying love at the conclusion acted as a counterbalance to that suffering. Pizzolatto was showing the duality of human nature, how it could be corrupted and evil, but also loving and willing to fight that evil. This duality is exemplified by how different Rust and Marty were from each other, but also in how they were individually, conflicted souls waging a war within. For as much as \"True Detective\" was about the darkness, it felt completely organic to end on Rust's, \"Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light's winning.\"\n\nAnd \"True Detective\" could've ended in the most horrific fashion imaginable. I began to think that was where we were headed after Errol seemed to get the upper-hand on Rust and Marty. And that final hunt through Carcosa - a hellhole of sickness and evil with the piles of children's clothes, retched skulls and devil nests, and a haunting chamber of death - and battle was just so well done. Kudos to Pizzolotta and Cary Joji Fukunaga for coming up with and executing a scene more frightening and intense than the climax to \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Also, the opening look into the Childress household and \"making flowers\" - shudder - was super creepy. That Errol's Yellow King was a total psychopath created by generations of abusive psychopaths also fit with \"True Detective's\" theme about the responsibility of being a parent and how neglecting that can have dangerous outcomes.\n\nIf Pizzolatto had decided to kill both Rust and Marty, the call never gets made for reinforcements and the murder of innocent women and children just continues, that would have been okay too. It would've fallen in direct correlation to Rust's pessimism and ideas that we're all just floating along in this \"thresher\" or \"giant gutter in space.\" And it would have been a super ballsy and utterly tragic way to end this story. But I'm glad Rust and Marty found redemption and catharsis in the end. And I don't think I fully realized how much I would have been devastated if Errol did win, until it looked like he was going to. (It was hard enough to sleep last night. I don't think i could've if Errol was still out there.) Again, this was just a magnificent way for the story to unfold that left me on the edge of my seat.\n\n\"True Detective\" is already on my short list for best TV show of 2014, and I doubt it will unseated from the number one spot. It's early in the year, but this show was incredibly acted by McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and some of the smaller characters like Shea Whigham's Joel Theriot and Glenn Fleshler as Errol in the finale. \"True Detective\" was also beautifully directed by Fukunaga; every episode was just a masterpiece. But in the end, I'm giving the biggest hat tip to Pizzolatto.\n\nThe narrative, and all the different subtexts swirling around inside of it, that Pizzolatto created was just brilliant when all was said and done. I didn't need for Marty's daughter found to be abused by the cult of the Yellow King, or for Marty's father-in-law to be involved. This was a messy end to a messy tale. There is still evil out there, and maybe Marty's daughter saw that evil first-hand. But there will always be evil and darkness in this world, especially if we don't see it explicitly. There's also a small, strong fragment of light that will hopefully shine on evil. And maybe that's what \"True Detective\" is really saying in this first season - that two men with inherent darkness found a way to let the light in, if only for an instant, and save themselves from a path of wickedness and sin.", "397": "LOS ANGELES, March 10 (UPI) -- Fans of the thriller True Detective were disappointed when HBO's streaming service crashed on Sunday during the much anticipated finale of the hit show.\n\nNervously twitching and wired fans on the East Coast logged onto the HBO GO streaming service at 9 p.m. only to be faced with a spinning circle on a black screen.

Photo: HBO\n\n[Spoilers ahead if you have not seen the season finale of True Detective.] In the end, Marty and Rust found hope, a first step out of the heart of darkness, if not the answers to every last awful detail of the Childress family history. But before that, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga took us to the depths of hell and back. (Read our thorough recap of everything that went down in the finale here and our TV critic on the series as a whole here.) With Carcosa and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s teary epiphany still on the brain Monday morning, Vulture spoke with Fukunaga about the many spinning theories still swirling (even now that the finale has aired) and putting together the show\u2019s final chapter.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate already about whether or not the finale settles the identity of the Yellow King \u2014 and whether it\u2019s meant to be a person at all.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think the final episode answered that, and I don\u2019t think it was creator Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s intention to answer that, even if people wanted it. It was more of an added layer to the reasons behind the killings. Rather than the Yellow King and the books about Carcosa and the mythology around that being the centerpiece for the finale, it was just another layer.\n\nWhat do you make of all the theorizing that went on around the show? The resolution to the murders was fairly straightforward \u2014 the crazy Spaghetti Monster did it \u2014 but there were many clues and Easter eggs planted along the way about this sprawling Tuttle/Childress/Ledoux conspiracy.\n\nMost of that was definitely deliberate \u2014 the lawnmower driving in circles at the end of episode seven, the use of spirals and stars. Some of it wasn\u2019t intentional, like when the truck was driving by and there\u2019s a yellow crown in the background. I\u2019ve been sent a lot of this stuff because my agent is a huge fanboy. He sent me The Simpsons\u2019 yellow king thing, and the one where the guy has an actual actor playing the yellow king. As much as we in development might have wanted to see the general sort of feeling of conspiracy and learn more about what this cult might have been about, the weight of the story needed to focus on Marty and Rust\u2019s relationship.\n\nLooking at the comments on several reviews of the finale, there\u2019s a particularly heavy obsession, borderline insanity, with why the \u201cclues\u201d about Marty\u2019s daughter Audrey (the drawings, dolls, and crown) were never addressed.\n\nI never read into what she was doing as having any relation to the crimes or the cult. I read Audrey\u2019s behavior as being the direct result of an inattentive father. Seeking male attention in other places, or even seeking to get into trouble, perhaps, to get the attention of her father; it was not related to the killings or anyone around them. I don\u2019t even remember seeing the spiral in her room. The general chatter around those things is great, but it\u2019s probably the kind of chatter that wouldn\u2019t have happened had all those episodes been released at once. The anticipation-speculation that comes with a weekly schedule is a double-edged sword. Because people have more time to talk about things, some crazy ideas get a lot of attention.\n\nThe killer\u2019s satanic labyrinth was incredible, almost like catacombs. Did you film that in a real location?\n\nYeah, it was shot at Fort Macomb about 45 minutes outside of New Orleans. That scene was originally described as taking place in a cypress forest. A lot of locations were supposed to take place in a forest, including the meth compound and the original crime scene, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of forests that are easy to shoot in around New Orleans. We had scouted that location for something else, actually. It was all chained and locked up and I like old things like that, especially Civil War things. When we got in, there were snakes everywhere and it was covered with weeds and grass. When we got to the inner chambers it was pretty awesome and really spooky and definitely had some weird energy around it.\n\nIn re-planning the ending, I pitched the fort, as if the cult had taken over some factory or something on the bayou and repurposed it. Childress had turned it into some cat-and-mouse-like maze to entrap these children and adolescents. There was a bridal path described in the script that a larger section of chambers in the fort worked perfectly for. It\u2019s hard to tell but there\u2019s a spiral-like nature to the maze and once you get to the final section before the altar room, the funnel grows smaller and smaller and smaller. I kept using the rooms that led downstairs. By the last part, it\u2019s almost like a womb. We did have to build the final octagonal altar room.\n\nAnother of Rust\u2019s hallucinations, this one a cosmic blue vortex, arrives at the worst possible moment. How was it described to you and what were you going for?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I could tell you what Nic originally had envisioned without getting in trouble. We landed on the spiral formation of the clouds as a wrapping-up of the symbology, or at least a book-ending of the symbology. I liked the idea that we could actually see Carcosa and black stars. If you look really closely, you can see black orbs floating in it. It was important to me that if we\u2019re gonna talk about these things, let\u2019s see them one more time before we finish.\n\nWhat were you trying to do with that last sequence of vistas going back over all the places we\u2019d been with Marty and Rust?\n\nWell, it\u2019s the kind of problem-solving you do when you\u2019re editing. There\u2019s a 25-minute sequence that takes place in the hospital at the end, and it was hard to gauge time in there. It\u2019s one scene after another took place in there. I felt like we needed some kind of break to allow the time jump from their conversation in the hospital to their final conversation outside at night. The only thing I could think of in terms of what we had was to revisit places that were important to the story itself of the characters.\n\nIt seemed to play into the whole everything repeats/\u201ctime is a flat circle\u201d theme.\n\nWell, yeah. Exactly. That\u2019s why we chose those locations. I tried to find the setups we used that had the same camera movement, and to time it so it went from day to night. In fact, that last image of the tree over the cane stocks, that was from the first images we shot, the cane field burning. So the beginning is the end, the end is the beginning, which is nice. [Laughs.] We shot that a week or two before principal photography began. It was just me and the cinematographer Adam Arkapaw and our main first unit crew. That was actually the camera I was operating on the crane.\n\nTalk about working with Matthew on Rust\u2019s final soliloquy.\n\nWe only did three takes on that, and I think that was the last take that we wound up using. I just let Matthew go. We rolled one take into the next, and that\u2019s where he got to on his own. The conversations we\u2019ve had about where he was at psychologically and physically were all part of getting to that but in terms of shaping his performance at that moment? I didn\u2019t have to do anything. Actually, the last thing we shot with Matthew, which was really great because we got to surprise him, was from episode seven when Marty\u2019s watching the video tape Rust stole from the Tuttle house and Matthew has his back to Woody. We start rolling and I keep it going and we gather the entire crew right outside the storage unit. We slammed the doors open, which kind of shocked him for a second, and then the whole crew was there to clap for him. It was pretty awesome. It seemed like he got misty-eyed for a second, but then he was in complete control as Matthew, usually he is. He delivered a very nice speech to the whole group.\n\nThe production designer said McConaughey went on a vision quest in that storage unit.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\n\nDid you get to go through his 450-page Rust file?\n\nNot really. He showed up to New Orleans already with pages and pages and pages of this character diary. I don\u2019t know how many pages his final thing was but he definitely would come to set with it, all this self-exploration.\n\nMcConaughey wasn\u2019t initially offered the role of Rust, and you\u2019ve said casting him called for some adjusting. How did you originally picture that character?\n\nThere are so many different ways I\u2019ve seen Cohle in my head and now it\u2019s hard to separate what I read two years ago from now watching Matthew for all this time. I knew Rust was dark and intelligent and he had his vices and a caustic way of interacting with people, but his voice, the tempo of his speech, his physicality, I can\u2019t remember at all. Even when Matthew said he wanted Rust, I kind of wrapped my head around it, but I wasn\u2019t sure what it was gonna be until the first day of shooting. Until he walked and spoke and smoked I had no idea what he was gonna become.\n\nRust\u2019s philosophizing has made him this season\u2019s star, but Marty\u2019s an important counterpoint. And he has a great moment of painful self-awareness in the end himself. Can you talk about striking the balance between those two characters?\n\nIt was important to see something like that from Marty. There\u2019s much more to explore there in terms of how one heals a family that\u2019s been so broken. There is some sort of detente there. When we were shooting the Hart story over the season, I always felt those interactions with the family were the most tangible examples of how behavior affects those around you. In many ways, it\u2019s the heart of the story. Cohle is this lone wolf on the outside and he can philosophize but you don\u2019t really see how he or his behavior affects other people. He\u2019s purposely isolated. There were more scenes with Hart\u2019s family that didn\u2019t make it into the show, about his daughter and his relationship with Maggie. I always found that stuff the most interesting to shoot in terms of human drama.\n\nWere those scenes cut for time? As you know, there\u2019s been some criticism of the show\u2019s female characters as being underdeveloped. Do you think these scenes would have helped?\n\nYeah, they weren\u2019t cut because of story weight so much as time. My original cut of episode five was more than 90 minutes, so there\u2019s a lot of material you lose. I still think it\u2019s a very strong 60-minute episode, but you always miss the things you know about that add to the character that no one else will ever know about. Even if they add deleted scenes to a DVD it\u2019s not the same as watching it in context from one moment to the next the way it was intended. I haven\u2019t read the New Yorker piece people talk about. I mean, it\u2019s true: the show wouldn\u2019t pass the Bechdel test. That\u2019s not necessarily a factor by which we should measure everything. It\u2019s a story about two guys and that\u2019s what it focuses on. It certainly does not focus on the women characters other than what it needs to to service the Hart story line.\n\nYou won\u2019t be directing next season. Any advice for person who takes the reins next season, assuming it will be just one person again?\n\n[Laughs.] \u201cYou can email me.\u201d We didn\u2019t finish until a couple weeks ago. I guess, \u201cStart training now.\u201d It\u2019s a doozy.", "399": "HBO\n\nListen to our True Detective Spoiler Special, in which our critics debate the season finale:\n\nDavid Haglund: \u201cQuite some time I\u2019m gonna be thinking about you, Rust.\u201d The corrupt sheriff Steve Geraci (Michael Harney) didn\u2019t intend that line, one of my favorites from tonight\u2019s finale, \u201cForm and Void,\u201d the way I do: He intends it as a threat. I think of it as my primary response to True Detective, and especially this episode. A lot of plot questions went more or less unanswered, which will bother some people, I\u2019m sure. What was the nature of the conspiracy? Just how were the Tuttles involved? Who was the Yellow King?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut the show answered the questions it needed to, both in terms of the storyline and, especially, with regard to its two central characters. In the end, this series really was more about them\u2014particularly Rust\u2014than it was about the wheels-within-wheels murder mystery that propelled the narrative. Quite some time I\u2019m gonna be thinking about him. What are you thinking about?\n\nWilla Paskin: Oh man. I just finished watching about five minutes ago, which means I\u2019ve had no real time to modulate my feelings, something I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll regret come the morning. But: I Really Did Not Like That. I think finales are under insane, constricting amounts of pressure in the Internet age, with thousands and thousands of people paying incredibly close attention to every single aspect of a show, hypothesizing en masse. If they do exactly what you were expecting, they\u2019re screwed; if they do less than you were expecting, they\u2019re screwed. It\u2019s very hard to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them.\n\nBut I am a little in awe of how totally snookered we all were. Boy, did we overthink this thing! The Internet\u2019s theories about the case were so much more ingenious and captivating than what happened in tonight\u2019s episode. They so much more neatly and plausibly tied up loose ends that the finale had no interest in. Maggie\u2019s father-in-law, Audrey, even the Yellow King\u2014not really relevant! Instead, we got a mansion out of Grey Gardens-meets-Deliverance deposited next to the largest catacomb this side of Europe. (Can you build that deep in the bayou? Or doesn\u2019t the water come up? Or was the whole thing constructed just so Rust and Marty could stare up at a flat circle?) Also, it finally happened: Someone made Cary Grant super creepy.\n\nWorse was the last character beat. I think maybe True Detective ended with Rust Cohle finding God? Talk me off the ledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHaglund: I\u2019ll try. For starters, Rust did not find God, so far as I could tell: He found physics. (I haven\u2019t watched the new Cosmos yet, but I hear its message is roughly the same.) Or maybe it\u2019s more accurate to say he found hope. And I found his final speech, out by the hospital parking lot, genuinely moving.\n\nI didn\u2019t love everything in the episode that preceded it. I did not find Errol William Childress an especially interesting monster. (You say Grey Gardens meets Deliverance, I say Norman Bates meets Hannibal Lecter.) But he did make sense thematically. That broken woman was apparently his sister, or half-sister, and she was evidently raped in her childhood by their grandfather. This was about the sins of the fathers being repeated by their sons. \u201cYou know what they did to me?\u201d Childress asked. \u201cWhat I would do to all the sons and daughters of man.\u201d\n\nThe theories concocted by the Internet were more elaborate and engaging purely in a puzzle-pieces sort of way, but Pizzolatto was apparently not kidding when he said his interests lay elsewhere. The show did quite a lot to nudge viewers down the rabbit hole, so I can understand some frustration. But I fell down there, too, and then came back up tonight, and was happy to do so.\n\nPaskin: Rust saying that he could feel a deeper darkness underneath him, one that was \u201cwarm, like a substance,\u201d where his father and daughter were waiting for him, that was all love, that he wanted to just \u201clet go\u201d and join? That does not sound much like physics to me! Or, really, much like Rust Cohle from early on. Which is fine, Rust is allowed to change. But it did seem to me like the show was more than a little in love with Rust, and maybe not for the good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHere is a character\u2014who, like you, I won\u2019t be able to forget anytime soon\u2014who was unique in part because of his particularly bleak way of thinking about his place in the universe. We\u2019re all sentient meat, and all. Not only does he end the episode talking about how the light is winning, right before he sees Errol Childress he has, what, a revelation\u2014or a hallucination that is almost indistinguishable from a revelation\u2014of the opening of a hellmouth pointing right at Childress? This seems rather cheesy and mystical. And has there ever been a more over-the-top headbutt? I mean that thing was straight out of The Expendables! (As was his \u201ccue the sniper\u201d move on Steve.) Hiked up four feet on the edge of a knife and he headbutts his way to life. It\u2019s enough to make me believe in a higher power\u2014or maybe just a bunch of dudes sitting around a camera, being all, \u201cYou know what would be so, so cool??\u201d\n\nHaglund: Rust learned his physics\u2014we\u2019re all star stuff, Willa\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean Fukunaga did. (Or maybe Fukunaga just prefers to ignore physics when staging action sesquences.) And I\u2019m honestly not bothered by the loose ends. It\u2019s clear enough to me what happened: Evil has existed in the Tuttle family for a long time, and Errol is the latest and most grotesque embodiment of it. As for what Rust saw when he reached the pit of Carcosa, I took that as another hallucination of the sort he has had throughout the series, brought on in this case by the intensity of the situation. Pizzolatto was careful to set that up with an earlier exchange in the car, where Marty asked Rust if he still saw things sometimes. \u201cNever stops, not really,\u201d he said, having apparently lied to Papania and Gilbough about this. \u201cWhat happened to my head, it\u2019s not something that gets better.\u201d\n\nAnd I don\u2019t see Rust\u2019s parking-lot epiphany as some spiritual deus ex machina. I see it, retrospectively, as what the whole series was building toward. His bleakness made him fascinating as a character, but we always knew it was rooted in pain\u2014of the worst kind, the death of a child. He had, after that tragedy, shed all of his illusions\u2014and all of humanity\u2019s, as far as he was concerned. That\u2019s the power of his revelation at the end: It\u2019s not based on fairy tales, it\u2019s based on his experience at the absolute pit of life. What he felt was love. And you can find that mawkish, if you like, and perhaps coming out of another actor\u2019s mouth it would have seemed as much. But McConaughey made it moving, for me.\n\nPaskin: And I am not trying to take that from you! But I am trying to figure out why my first thought when the camera panned in on Rust sitting in his hospital bed, staring out the window at the city lights, in the midst of immense psychological distress, was, \u201cOh, he looks a lot like a guy in KISS.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne of the things I have so enjoyed about True Detective\u2014which, let me be clear, is a show I still really love\u2014is how all-enveloping it is. It\u2019s a whole world, and you\u2019re in it: the atmosphere, the green, even that ash and aluminum smell. But something about this episode just cracked that open for me, and all of pop culture came pouring in. The house Errol lived in looks so much like the mansion in The Notebook gone to seed. Having no cell phone reception is very every-horror-movie-ever. It\u2019s like, the spell wore off and suddenly it was just a TV show.\n\nI think part of this is that the show did not just leave plot loose-ends, it left emotional ones as well (though perhaps not with regard to Rust). I wrote a piece a few weeks ago, about how True Detective semi-ignored its female characters on purpose. Now I think it was kind of just ignoring its female characters. All the stuff that was going on with Audrey, with Maggie\u2014and there they are, at Marty\u2019s bedside, as unfleshed out as ever. (And what was the deal with Maggie\u2019s wedding rings?)\n\nI did love the moment where the woman whose house had been painted green remembered exactly how much it cost. There was something so perfect and human about that to me, the just-right detail that encapsulates so much of what True Detective did right. But the show really was, ultimately and intentionally, a bromance, albeit a really well-acted and well-written one. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but I did think that it was maybe something more, something in-addition-to. Not that I don\u2019t hope Marty and Rust are giving each other the finger for eternity.\n\nHaglund: Here\u2019s how I see it. When we\u2014and by \u201cwe\u201d here, I mean a significant percentage of the True Detective-watching Internet\u2014saw those drawings that Audrey did, we figured that they were clues to something that would be revealed later. But really they were clues to what was going on with her in that moment. Was Audrey a victim of Childress? Probably not. But was she a victim of some other abuser? I\u2019m guessing yes. Perhaps Maggie\u2019s father. We don\u2019t get the answers spelled out for us, but there\u2019s enough to suggest that something like that happened. The sins of Childress may take an extreme form, but they are not unique. They do not come out of nowhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to say that Audrey or Maggie or Lisa or Beth were as well developed as characters as Rust and Marty were; this was, ultimately, the Rust-and-Marty show, and the rest of the series revolved around them. Nobody else on True Detective could spout a cliche like \u201cDon\u2019t ever change, man,\u201d and have it feel perfect and hilarious. (Their hospital banter was a hoot.) For viewers who say that they\u2019ve seen too many shows about dead beautiful women and the men who fail to save them, I can understand that response. But I think that this series, while not all-encompassing, was wonderfully what it was: a gripping, twisty, moody show about two men, and how one of them came through despair to the other side.\n\nPaskin: It\u2019s true, we don\u2019t know what happened to Audrey\u2014and that\u2019s the end of it. We just don\u2019t know. I think I would be bothered a little less by this if I didn\u2019t feel like the finale was in some ways very flabby. (It had something like five endings.) We really learned very little new information this episode\u2014basically none, since we learned that something was definitely up with Childress at the end of last week. Instead, we got a long, dreamy sequence through this insanely detailed set, and moderate-to-no answers on many of the dangling questions. Which is an interesting and valid choice, obviously\u2014a choice that seems even more willful given how loose this episode was.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m not super into the idea that major characters have to die for a TV show to be serious, it\u2019s pretty surprising that Marty and Rust both lived, no? An ax to the throat probably has a pretty high mortality rate. And the show tacked an additional happy ending on to their survival: The almost-final shot of the two of them leaning on each other through the parking lot was all the more sweet because you know in three days they\u2019ll barely speak again.\n\nHaglund: The lowpoint of the finale, for me, was when Rust and Marty were looking at Marty\u2019s laptop, going through ... tax records, I think it was? That did not strike me as the tightest bit of writing. So I can see, at least partly, where you\u2019re coming from with regard to the flabbiness issue. And I did think, once they\u2019d both gotten the business end of one of Errol\u2019s blades\u2014though I\u2019m not sure either was hit in the throat, precisely\u2014and were lying on the ground, that they had died, that this was how the series would end, with two detectives chasing a monster to their doom.\n\nThat such an outcome actually felt like a live possibility is probably why the chase through the catacombs\u2014and that fort is a real place in southern Louisiana, by the way\u2014was riveting for me, purely as an action sequence. That shot of the top of McConaughey\u2019s head, as he made his way through the tunnels? Fantastic work by Fukunaga and his cinematographer. I did wonder how, exactly, Errol\u2019s voice traveled so well. And while I\u2019m on his voice: The British accent was weird. I guess he learned one from all those VHS tapes he had stacked up around the TV.\n\nPaskin: Very American Hustle with the in-and-out British accent. (There\u2019s another pop-culture reference that flitted through my brain.) And I wondered: Was Errol\u2019s voice in Carcosa a hallucination? And how long had Errol\u2019s daddy been tied up to that bed? Did he kill him right when he saw Marty and Rust roll up? But also: These are very small questions to be thinking about, compared to the bigger conspiracy.\n\nStill, if they didn\u2019t get \u2018em all, \u201cWe got ours,\u201d as Marty said. And we, like Rust, will have to be content with the resolution that we did get. Or, at least, content until next season, when the dark and the light take up fighting again.\n\nHaglund: \u201cI believe \u2018no shit\u2019 is the proper response to that observation.\u201d I\u2019m looking forward to the second installment.", "400": "(GRAPHIC: Flickr / IntelFreePress)The four largest wireless carriers in the U.S. - Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nSprint and T-Mobile, the third and fourth largest carriers in the U.S., need to expand coverage, according to two recent studies. The study reports Verizon Wireless as the country's largest wireless network, with AT&T tailing. Verizon and AT&T combined, serve two-thirds of the subscribing public. RootMetrics and JD Power conducted the studies.\n\nA news analysis in Computerworld said the studies undeniably convey federal regulators a rationale to allow Sprint and T-Mobile to merge, just as Softbank of Japan, the parent company of Sprint, desires. Softbank Chief Executive, Masayoshi Son, has been reported by the Wall Street Journal as bidding for T-Mobile, despite opposition from the antitrust officials in the U.S. worried that carrier competition will be reduced. Likewise, the Justice Department rejected the offer of AT&T to purchase T-Mobile in 2012.\n\nRegulators are weighing whether the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would improve wireless network coverage, not just for months, but for years; and if they can become profitable enough to buy a new spectrum. Both Sprint and T-Mobile have their respective customers in the same places and need to reach beyond their current footprints, which would only be possible with more spectrum. Two auctions for spectrum are coming in the next two years \u2013 one for high-frequency AWS-3 in September, and the other for low-frequency 600 MHz which is currently used for broadcast TV.\n\nFor the two companies, the timing may not be right as it could take months to come up with a sound merger review for federal officials, and at the same time bid in the auctions. For now, major cities additional spectrum is what both companies need to enhance, as stated in the report by RootMetrics and JD Power.", "401": "Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son has made no secret of his desire to create the biggest company in the world, and in a new interview with Charlie Rose, the Japanese tech mogul hints that T-Mobile may be next on his acquisition list.\n\nWith the acquisition of Sprint in his rear view mirror, Son, now chairman of Sprint, believes he needs more scale in the United States to compete with the likes of AT&T and Verizon.\n\nWhen pressed directly by Rose as to whether or not he has already made an agreement to acquire T-Mobile, Son was coy, saying, \"I don't know. We have to give it a shot \u2026 We would like to make a deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out.\"\n\nRumors of a Sprint merger with T-Mobile have floated for months, with some reports hinting that a formal offer might be on the table in the first half of 2014.\n\nA merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would put the combined wireless carrier on equal footing with the other two heavyweights in the U.S., which is exactly what Son wants.\n\n\"We need a certain scale,\" Son said. \"But once we have enough scale to have a level fight, a three-heavyweight fight, I would like to have a real fight, not a pseudo fight. If I could have a real fight, I would go for a massive price war \u2014 a technology war.

If the merger does come to pass, will T-Mobile's recent high-profile swipes at its competitors sit well with Son, an entrepreneur raised in the conservative confines of Japan Inc.?\n\nThe truth is that while T-Mobile's current colorful CEO, John Legere, might seem like a potentially odd fit to lead a Son-controlled T-Mobile/Sprint venture, Son himself is actually considered something of a wildcard maverick back in Japan. A quick study of Softbank's domestic price wars and early fight to become the first carrier to bring the iPhone to Japan reveals that Son and Legere might turn out to be a perfect match.\n\nDuring the interview, Son would not reveal what stage the talks with T-Mobile have reached, if any, but industry watchers are expecting an offer to be presented sometime soon.\n\nIf the bootstrapped telecom mogul who successfully took on Japan's biggest wireless players years ago can pull the U.S. merger off, it would put him one step toward his stated goal of becoming the \"world's biggest company \u2014 by all measures, whether by sales, profit, or market cap.\"\n\nDoubling down on those sentiments, Son told Rose, \"I want to be No. 1.\"\n\nThe full interview with Rose has not yet been released online, but you check out two brief snippets in the videos above.\n\nUPDATE, March 11, 7:30 p.m. ET:\n\nThe full interview is now available on the Charlie Rose show website.", "402": "The billionaire boss of Softbank, which owns US network Sprint, has promised a price and technology war with American mobile market leaders AT&T and Verizon \u2013 if he's allowed to merge with T-Mobile US, of course.\n\nMasayoshi Son made the promise during an interview with PBS' Charlie Rose, as embedded below. Son said Verizon and AT&T, numbers one and two in the US mobile market respectively, were sucking up 90 per cent of the disposable cash in the market. Sprint, the number three player, wants to merge with the number four player T-Mobile US, so he can fight on a nearly level playing with the two industry behemoths.\n\n\"If I can have a real fight I'd go in with a massive price war and a technology war. I want to be number one,\" he said. \"I would go with price competition very much aggressively and network competition to create the world's best network.\"\n\nSoftbank bought Sprint in 2013 after getting the nod from the American government, and has spent the last year upgrading its network. Sprint backed Intel's WiMax standard for 4G, a mistake that cost the company dearly, but it is now shifting to LTE in line with the rest of the US market.\n\nSon said he would like to merge with T-Mobile US, which is the fastest growing mobile carrier after its CEO sparked a price war. So far that conflict has forced AT&T and Verizon to cut prices and increase users' mobile broadband download allowances.\n\nWhile there has been no formal offer for T-Mobile US by Sprint, it's clear there have been informal discussions. On Monday T-Mob US's CFO Braxton Carter said such a merger was highly likely in the future, assuming regulators give a thumbs up.\n\nThe US government blocked AT&T's proposed merger with T-Mobile US on competition grounds, pointing out (correctly in El Reg's opinion) that reducing competition isn't what the expensive US mobile market needs. But a merger of the two minnows of mobile may be looked on more favorably, although one Department of Justice official thinks otherwise.\n\nSon said he was willing to forgo short-term profits in order to stimulate long-term growth in subscriber numbers \u2013 a tactic that's working for T-Mobile US, which admittedly ran up a $20m loss in the last quarter. \u00ae\n\nSponsored: Five steps to dealing with the insider threat", "403": "SoftBank CEO: US needs to increase Internet speed 9:58 AM ET Tue, 11 March 2014\n\nSoftBank's CEO pressed his case Tuesday to merge the Japanese company's Sprint operations with T-Mobile despite concerns over antitrust issues, telling CNBC he could increase U.S. broadband speeds by tenfold.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Squawk on the Street,\" Masayoshi Son said wireless connectivity in the U.S. lags woefully behind other countries, For example, he said Japanese web users receive broadband connections up to twice as fast as their U.S. counterparts.

I\u2019d like to bring that to the States,\u201d Son told an audience of industry officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cI would like to provide an alternative to the oligopolistic situation that two-thirds of American households can only get access to one or two providers. I\u2019d like to be a third alternative with 10 times the speed and lower price.\u201d\n\nSon said Sprint has the same type of radio frequencies that helped SoftBank compete in Japan and SoftBank has technologies that could boost speeds and lower prices, but his companies needed more towers and other support to properly challenge the biggest Internet providers.\n\n\u201cWe have the spectrum. We have the technology. But we need scale, efficiency to make an investment for the network,\u201d Son told reporters after his speech.\n\n\u201cWe are already free cash-flow negative. So we can start a small fight but it does not scale, it does not last, it\u2019s not sustainable. We need to have a real fight, a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that, we need scale.\u201d\n\nBoth the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Tom Wheeler, and U.S. antitrust chief William Baer expressed skepticism about a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile after Son\u2019s round of meetings in Washington in February.\n\nSoftBank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves toward pursuing a deal were now on hold. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.\n\nSon, who once threatened to set himself on fire as he pushed Japanese regulators to let him set up a high-speed Internet service, has shown he does not give up easily. He said he wasn\u2019t planning on new meetings with U.S. regulators during this trip, \u201cbut whenever we have the opportunity sometime in the future, that is I think necessary.\u201d\n\nSon has repeatedly expressed his desire to make SoftBank the biggest mobile-related corporation in the world, and in the past has harshly criticized U.S. mobile networks and the degree of competition in the industry.\n\nThe potential for the deal and Son\u2019s criticisms have given an edge to the dynamic among top wireless executives.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Son is having a bad experience with US wireless, it must be because he\u2019s using Sprint,\u201d Jim Cicconi, AT&T\u2019s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said jokingly in an emailed statement.\n\nEven T-Mobile\u2019s CEO, John Legere, an avid user of social media site Twitter, quipped last week, \u201cRemember when people actually liked @sprint?

Now Sprint is looking to buy them so they can better compete with AT&T and Verizon, who arguably have a duopoly in the US wireless industry. However, the FCC and DOJ aren't keen on having only three wireless carriers in the US. They have stated that they want four. Which is why Softbank/Sprint still hasn't put in a bid for T-Mobile yet.\n\n\"We'd like to make a deal, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,\" Softbank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son stated on the Rose show earlier this week. Rose stated that the FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler wants more competition in the wireless industry, thus meaning he doesn't want consolidation. However, Son's response makes a ton of sense, that Sprint and T-Mobile \"are two little ones who are not able to fight without enough scale.\"\n\nA Sprint/T-Mobile merger would turn the market into a \"three heavyweight fight\" stated Son. \"I would like to have the real fight, not a pseudo fight, the real fight.\" He continued to say \"If I can have a real fight, I go in with a more massive price war.\" The price war we've already been seeing from T-Mobile, has affected AT&T, while Verizon has decided to sit back and watch how it all plays out.\n\nThere was a recent study, which we covered, that found Sprint's monthly bill to be second highest in the US following Verizon. The low-down of that study was that Verizon is averaging about $148/month, Sprint at $144/month and T-Mobile is $120/month with T-Mobile being the lowest among carriers. I'm really excited to see a price war between all the carriers, but we know Verizon won't budge until they start losing a good number of customers. Which won't happen because they have the best network, still. But a price war is something all consumers can get behind. Right?", "406": "Japan's SoftBank Corp. founder and President Masayoshi Son holds a press briefing in Tokyo on February 12, 2014 SoftBank, eyeing a tie-up of its US wireless unit Sprint with T-Mobile, stepped up its campaign Tuesday, claiming it could boost competition for Americans as it did in Japan.\n\nMasayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of the Japanese tech giant, touted the benefits of such competition in what was billed as a major address to the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"Japan had the most expensive Internet before I started,\" he told the group.\n\n\"As a result of our challenge, Japan became (the country with) the highest speed Internet and the lowest price.\"\n\nSon said he hopes to shake up the US market in the same way: \"I want to change the United States from number 15 out of 16 countries to number one. I would like to bring new competition.\"\n\nAlthough Son made no reference to T-Mobile, his company has made no secret that it wants to combine number three carrier Sprint with the number four wireless group to take on larger rivals AT&T and Verizon.\n\n'A real fight'\n\nAsked by reporters after his speech of his plans for T-Mobile, Son said: \"We have not decided yet, but scale matters to have a real fight.\"\n\nHe added that the US market is now dominated by just a small group of wireless providers and that \"we need a real heavyweight fight today to have real competition... We have spectrum, we have the technology but we need scale to have efficiency to make investments.\"\n\nSon appeared to be more certain of his interest during an interview that aired late Monday on PBS television.\n\n\"We would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,\" he said.\n\nSon said he had no plans to meet US regulators during his Washington visit but that this was just \"the first phase\" of his efforts in the American market.\n\nJapan's SoftBank Corp. founder and President Masayoshi Son speaks during a press briefing to announce the company's financial results in Tokyo on February 12, 2014\n\nSoftBank last year sealed a deal to take a controlling stake in Sprint for more than $20 billion. Since then reports have been swirling about a potential deal for T-Mobile, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom.\n\nSuch a deal would likely face close regulatory scrutiny; a prior effort to sell T-Mobile to AT&T was shot down by regulators in 2011.\n\nBut Son said the tech landscape is changing, citing the planned merger of the two largest US cable broadband firms, Comcast and Time Warner Cable.\n\nWireless alternatives\n\nHe said that with Sprint's new ultrafast technology, wireless can become a viable alternative to fixed broadband, and could even deliver higher speeds.\n\nBut Son suggested that Sprint would need to get bigger to justify the big capital expenditures needed for ultrafast wireless.\n\n\"Wireless is not an alternative to (fixed broadband) now but I would like to give this a try,\" he told his audience.\n\n\"We have the technology. We want to deploy it,\" he said.\n\nSoftBank announced separately the hiring of a well-connected Washington insider to lead up lobbying efforts.\n\nA company statement said Bruce Gottlieb would become executive vice president for legal and regulatory affairs, based in Washington.\n\nA Deutsche Telekom T-Mobile logo hangs under pink umbrellas at the stand of the German telecommunications giant at the 2014 CeBIT computer technology trade fair on March 10, 2014 in Hanover, central Germany\n\nGottlieb has been president of the National Journal, part of Atlantic Media, and was chief counsel of the Federal Communications Commission and a member of the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Team in 2008.\n\nAnalysts point out that any deal linking the third and fourth largest wireless firms would face many hurdles.\n\nThe research firm Trefis said such a deal \"makes sense when taking a long-term view of the wireless industry\" but seems difficult.\n\n\"Deutsche Telekom is looking to exit the US market but is wary of regulatory roadblocks, which stopped a previous takeover attempt of T-Mobile.\"\n\nDouglas McIntyre at 24/7 Wall Street said it is not clear if such a merger would be good thing.\n\n\"Even on the long chance that regulators would approve such a deal, it is hard to see why the merger would be good for shareholders or customers,\" McIntyre said in a blog post Tuesday.\n\n\"Putting together the two firms would be a logistics nightmare.\"\n\nSuch a tie-up, the analyst said, \"would take years to integrate properly, if it could be. In the meantime, AT&T and Verizon would have unprecedented opportunities to steal the new entity's clients.\"\n\nExplore further: Japan's SoftBank says nine-month profit soars 58%", "407": "The CEO of Japan's SoftBank wireless carrier promised to bring stiff price and speed competition to the U.S., saying he feels an obligation to improve slow speeds and drive down prices.\n\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son credited his years in high school and college in the U.S. as essential to creating his entrepreneurial spirit, and said he feels a debt to his \"second home.\"\n\nHe promised a Washington, D.C., audience Tuesday that SoftBank's mid-2013 acquisition of Sprint will give the carrier the ability to drive lower prices and deliver faster speeds than are now available in the U.S., with Sprint eventually providing 200Mbps service across the country.\n\nSon, in a biography-heavy speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, didn't mention a potential merger with mobile competitor T-Mobile USA, although he was quoted in a newspaper article Wednesday as saying he would start a \"massive price war\" in the U.S. if he were able to merge Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nU.S. mobile and fixed broadband services are lagging behind much of the rest of the world, Son said.

Further commentary also suggest Son has the patience and tenacity to see his vision through.\n\nIn the interview, Son says a three-dog race is the only way to have a \u201creal fight\u201d. In Son\u2019s view, neither Sprint nor T-Mobile can scale quickly enough to make an impact on the Verizon/AT&T dominance. Though a merger still places a new company in third place with regard to customer count, it\u2019s much more level. A new company would have around 100 customers, just behind Verizon with 102 million and AT&T with around 110 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in a more massive price war, a technology war\u201d said Son, tapping into carrier complacency regarding Internet speeds in the US. as another reason he\u2019d like to make a merger happen. \u201cThe mobile Internet, the Internet highway, is the most important infrastructure for the 21st century. We would like to make the deal happen\u201d.\n\nRegulators are notoriously opposed to mergers of this kind, preferring to have four major carriers instead of three. The previous acquisition involved T-Mobile and AT&T, so it may have just been the scale that bothered regulators in that case. A Sprint merger with T-Mobile would still leave them in last place, and disparate technology (for now\u2026) only makes it less seamless.\n\nAnother concern is competitive practices. Regulators are worried less competition means less value for consumers, a concern Son is working hard to quell. Having recently met with the FCC to discuss such matters, Son is now pleading his case to the people. Son says he\u2019s willing to lose money initially on the deal to wage his war, instead opting to level his battle field with pricing first. We\u2019ll hope more details arrive before an offer is made \u2014 we\u2019d love to see his plans for disrupting the current market.\n\nVia: Bloomberg\n\n", "413": "Sprint's parent company wants to buy T-Mobile.

Its aim is to upend the mobile industry, and it's been doing that by eliminating contracts, dropping international roaming charges and offering to pay competitors' customers $650 to switch over.\n\nThe big boys are already feeling the pressure. AT&T recently offered T-Mobile customers $450 to switch and twice cut prices this year. Sprint and Verizon have also cut prices in response to T-Mobile's campaign, and all three of T-Mobile's competitors have begun moving away from two-year contracts.\n\nWhen blocking AT&T from buying T-Mobile in 2011, the Obama administration argued that consumers were better off with a fourth player like T-Mobile. Antitrust lawyers at the Justice Department said the company's underdog status made it disruptive, keeping the industry competitive.\n\n\"AT&T's acquisition of T\u2011Mobile would eliminate the important price, quality, product variety, and innovation competition that an independent T\u2011Mobile brings to the marketplace,\" the lawsuit stated.\n\nThat has certainly come to pass. T-Mobile made good on its promise as an innovator. That's why Allen Grunes, an antitrust lawyer for Geyer Gorey in Washington, D.C., said the odds are stacked against a merger this time as well.\n\n\"That tells the DOJ they were right,\" Grunes said. \"The decision to block was the correct decision, so why would you let another telecom take them over?\"\n\nBut it's unclear how long T-Mobile can keep that up. The rebel approach earned it 1.6 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2013, but the company's posted a $20 million loss.\n\nThat's why some industry experts believe T-Mobile and Sprint would be better off together.\n\nKen Dulaney, a mobile analyst for Gartner, said he isn't convinced T-Mobile's strategy is working. And Sprint is still hurting from ineffective business ventures that he calls \"massive diversions\" -- such as investing in the failed WiMax wireless technology, and disastrously merging with Nextel in 2005.\n\n\"The way it stands right now, four years from now we'll see two really big guys and two wannabes,\" he said.\n\nSoftbank's Son hopes regulators see a merger between the third- and fourth-biggest carriers as more favorable than No. 1 buying No. 4.\n\n\"Two little ones who are not able to fight ... that's no good, and I think the situation needs to be changed,\" he said.\n\nPosted by Greg Palmer", "414": "Sprint looks like it may get some support from T-Mobile concerning a potential merger between the two wireless networks as T-Mobile's chief financial officer stated he believes consolidation is inevitable at a media, internet and telecom conference Monday.\n\n\"It is not a question of if, it is a question of when,\" Braxton Carter said Monday. \"To take a third-scale national player that has the scale benefits with the right business model could be very competitively enhancing in the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nThe comments raise hopes about the sale of T-Mobile to Sprint, owned by Japanese-based SoftBank Corp. Both Sprint and T-Mobile have argued that consolidation between the third-largest and fourth-largest carriers in the United States is necessary to compete with the top two that are Verizon and AT&T. Even after combining customer bases, Sprint and T-Mobile would have less than second-largest carrier AT&T.\n\n\"The government can't have their cake and eat it too. If they think there really needs to be four players in this market on a nationwide basis, they are going to have to put some structural protections to ensure an adequate distribution of spectrum,\" Carter said.\n\nThe owner of T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom AG, however, has stated it will continue to plan as if it will be on its own.\n\n\"We have a standalone position which is good and which we're building out,\" Deutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Hoettges said at an earnings press conference in Bonn, Germany on Thursday. \"You can't build your planning on a potential transaction. It's really difficult to judge.\"\n\nRecent reports show that Sprint and T-Mobile trail Verizon and AT&T in terms of coverage and service quality. SoftBank chief executive and Sprint chairman Masayoshi Son has been stirring things up at Sprint, attempting to shake the \"loser\" mentality he believes pervades the Kansas-based carrier.\n\n\"Sprint is a daimyo in Kansas,\" Son said, referring to Japanese feudal lords that have very little power outside their home turf. \"That's not enough.\"\n\n\"We need to change Sprint's culture,\" Son told The Wall Street Journal after a news conference in February.\n\nOne solution, Son believes, is acquiring T-Mobile.\n\n\"Without industry consolidation, for Sprint alone to become No. 1 in the U.S. is literally just a dream. I'm not content for Sprint to remain No. 3 because if we could grow bigger, we will offer aggressive discounts and services, just like we did in Japan,\" Son said during the recent Sprint quarterly earnings report.\n\n\"There is a huge gap between the bigger two and the smaller two, thus the level of competition isn't sound or strong.\"\n\nEccentric T-Mobile CEO John Legere agrees, noting that it is hard to compete with the juggernauts that are Verizon and AT&T.\n\n\"If the government wants us to have a competitive environment, you are going to make sure that the duopoly doesn't use their prowess to crush the little guys and have this sub-1 GHz spectrum be moved all to them,\" Legere said during an interview on the television show Bloomberg West.\n\n\"We're all going to need better scale and capability. The question starts to be: How do you take the maverick and supercharge it? We either need more spectrum and capability, a lot more investment, or we need consolidation.\"\n\nDespite the pleas of Sprint, however, the U.S. government has expressed concern that further market consolidation would end up hurting consumers. Both the Justice Department's antitrust division and the FCC have made it clear they aren't sold on allowing Sprint to acquire T-Mobile.\n\nSprint's Son will be making his case for a merger with T-Mobile to the Chamber of Commerce in Washington Tuesday.", "415": "Softbank Has its Eye on T-Mobile Again... SoftBank, the company that acquired a controlling stake in Sprint last year, has allegedly been discussing a merger with T-Mobile USA. This would in theory create a more competitive alternative to AT&T and Verizon. Softbank\u2019s CEO, Masayoshi Son, said in an interview with Charlie Rose (on Monday) that he'd \"like to have the real fight\" for mobile supremacy, adding that if he can get to that point, he would enter into \"a more massive price war.\" Based on Son's comments, it seems he may also be trying to compete with the major 2 networks on price. Of course, if that\u2019s the case Softbank would have to sacrifice profits right off the bat, but assuming they can pull it off, it\u2019s likely they\u2019d be able to increase market share over the long-term. Son didn't mention any plans to actually acquire T-Mobile, but his visit to the US this week has been perceived as a lobbying trip to pitch such a merger to policymakers. Son will be speaking in Washington, D.C. today about his belief that large, competitive wireless carriers can be strong competitors to broadband providers in the consumer market. In order for his company to reach that level of competitiveness, Sprint would likely need T-Mobile's help. Now the question is whether or not Son can actually make this deal happen. In 2011, the US government played with the idea of a wireless merger involving T-Mobile, but it was denied when AT&T made a $39 billion bid for the fourth-largest US carrier. With that in mind, Son certainly needs to make his case before SoftBank and Sprint try taking over T-Mobile.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "416": "Countless reports have come in over the past few months predicting the possibility of a merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. carriers, Sprint and T-Mobile. So far nothing official has materialized, though it has been reported that Sprint is meeting with regulators to see if they would be open to the idea. The merger would allow them to compete much more effectively against Verizon and AT&T, two of the largest mobile carriers in the U.S. T-Mobile US CFO Braxton Carter has said that the merger isn\u2019t a question of if, \u201cit is a question of when.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Telekom has a majority stake in T-Mobile US and it too is open to the idea of a merger with Sprint. While it has said that there are no issues with running T-Mobile US as a standalone carrier, if an opportunity for consolidation in the U.S. market opens up, Deutsche Telekom has gone on record to say that it would enter the process with \u201can open mind.\u201d\n\nCarter says that the scale benefits of merging with a third-scale national player with the appropriate business model could be \u201cvery competitively enhancing\u201d in the country. He also says that if the government wants to retain competition in this market it must stop Verizon and AT&T from steamrolling everyone else at spectrum auctions, he calls for structural protections to \u201censure an adequate distribution of spectrum.\u201d\n\nRumor has it that regulators are not warming up to the idea of consolidation. Last time someone bid for T-Mobile was back in 2011, AT&T pledged $39 billion only to be shot down by regulators, holding the view that four national carriers are needed to preserve competition.\n\nFiled in .

Over the past few months rumors have been going around about a possible merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, SoftBank already has a controlling stake in Sprint. Top executives from both the parent company and the carrier have reportedly been courting regulators and taking their temperature, trying to ascertain if a takeover bid will be blocked based on regulatory concerns. The idea is that Sprint and T-Mobile together will be able to launch an effective competition against Verizon and AT&T. In an interview with Charlie Rose, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said that he\u2019d like to have \u201cthe real fight\u201d for supremacy in this arena and that when that becomes possible, he\u2019d wage a \u201cmore massive price war\u201d against the two behemoths.\n\nIts possible that the strategy Son has in mind is to undercut both Verizon and AT&T on price. While this would reduce revenue in the short term, it would maximize growth and market share over the long term. Even combining Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s entire user base doesn\u2019t bring it close to what AT&T holds, and Verizon sits even further than that. If the tail enders of the U.S. wireless industry get together, the two behemoths could get a run for their money.\n\nBut its not like regulators haven\u2019t blocked a similar bid before. In 2011, AT&T agreed to acquire T-Mobile for $39 billion only for the deal to be shot down by regulators. One could make the case that AT&T would have had an unfair advantage due to its already strong position, had the deal gone through, and that the outcome won\u2019t be the same with Sprint. Regulators held back then that four national carriers are healthy for maintaining competition in the U.S. wireless industry, if their beliefs haven\u2019t been shaken, then its unlikely that Sprint and T-Mobile will ever get together.\n\nFiled in .

The show is scheduled to be broadcast late on Monday in the United States.\n\nThe possibility of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which was acquired by Softbank last year, was given the cold shoulder by regulators, with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler expressing scepticism in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on February 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter.\n\nRegulators are concerned that reducing the number of major wireless carriers to three from four would hinder competition, but Son has argued that competition would be more robust if a third strong player is created through the merger of smaller firms Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nSoftbank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves towards pursuing a deal were now on hold.

On a mildly gloomy trading day, the telecom sits among the bottom five Dow stocks, nursing a 1.2% haircut. The Dow itself was down about 43 points as of 12:38 p.m. EDT, and Verizon accounted for four of those negative points all by itself.\n\nSo what's wrong with Big Red today?\n\nThe big news in telecom today comes from Sprint (NYSE:S), whose Japanese chairman Masayoshi Son wants to make a big splash in the American market.\n\nThe founder, chairman, and CEO of Sprint parent SoftBank made his billions by shaking up the Japanese market for mobile services, and he's taking that approach to Sprint as well. But he'll need some help to get it done -- and that prospect should scare Verizon's investors.\n\nIn an interview with PBS talk show host Charlie Rose, Son said he wants to take on the Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T) duopoly with his own megacarrier of comparable size.\n\nFirst, regulators must let him acquire fellow mini-major T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and its 47 million subscribers (Sprint boasts 54 million) to give the new entity the required economies of scale.\n\nThen the gloves will come off.\n\n\"We need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK,\" Son told Rose. \"It's a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in a more massive price war, a technology war.\"\n\nRegulators worry that combining Sprint with T-Mobile would create less competition rather than more, because there would be fewer nationwide networks. Son would argue the opposite, because you would have three giants of roughly equal scale, and it would be a fair fight rather than two giants trampling on the ants around their feet.\n\nAnd Son would be perfectly willing to forget about profits for a few years, taking a big price war to the American market. Verizon and AT&T would have to adjust to a third peer undercutting them at every turn, or suffer the consequences as users start fleeing to an obviously less expensive option.\n\nMoreover, Son noted that America has the world's largest market for mobile broadband, but that current services are both expensive and slow by international standards. In a separate interview with CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Son said that Japanese mobile broadband users can get up to 60 megabits per second out of their mobile connections. Americans typically have to settle for 20 megabits. Son's SoftBank is testing connections of more than 700 megabits in Tokyo, and there's a 200-megabit solution ready to roll -- if Sprint gets to merge with T-Mobile first.\n\n\"America is the only country that post-paid contract prices are going up,\" Son told CNBC. \"All the rest of the world, prices are going down.\"\n\nIf Son can bring this vision to reality in America, Verizon and AT&T will indeed have a hard time supporting their rising plan costs.\n\nBut again, Son contends that he needs the resources of T-Mobile to make all of this happen -- and that's not an easy slam-dunk win.\n\n\"You think you can win that argument?\" asked CNBC's David Faber to close out that interview.\n\n\"I don't know. I don't know,\" Son replied. \"I'm just throwing the stone into the pond, right? I'm just making a wake-up call.\"\n\nVerizon investors heard Masayoshi Son today. AT&T shares also fell 0.9%.

If I can have a real fight, I go in a more massive price war, a technology war.\u201dHe also wants to upgrade our (frankly, rather pathetic) Internet infrastructure and push wireless broadband instead of cable--both of which are items that we sorely need.According to Bloomberg, Son has done just that before, when he bought Vodafone Group\u2019s Japan wing years ago, renamed it \u201cSoftBank\u201d, and substantially increased the carrier\u2019s market share and user base.It\u2019s a tough proposition, then, a gamble that U.S. regulators have to make: Can they trust Son to make good on his word that having three more or less equal mobile competitors is better than having two smaller companies and two larger?", "422": "Sprint\u2019s Chairman, Masayoshi Son, is coming to Washington to explain how wireless competition in the US would be improved if only there were less of it.\n\nAfter buying Sprint last year for $21.6 billion, he has floated plans to buy T-Mobile. When antitrust officials voiced their concerns about the proposed plan\u2019s potential impact on wireless competition, Son decided to respond with an unusual strategy that goes something like this: The US wireless market isn\u2019t competitive enough, so policymakers need to approve the merger of the third and fourth largest wireless companies in order to improve competition, because going from four nationwide wireless companies to three will make things even more competitive. Got it? Me neither.\n\nAn argument like that takes nerve, especially now. When AT&T attempted to buy T-Mobile a few years ago, Sprint led the charge against it, arguing vociferously that permitting the market to consolidate from four to only three nationwide wireless companies would harm innovation and wireless competition. After the Administration blocked the merger, T-Mobile rebounded in the marketplace, which immediately made it the poster child for the Administration\u2019s antitrust policies.\n\nIt also makes Son\u2019s plan a non-starter. Allowing Sprint to buy T-Mobile three years after telling AT&T it could not would take incredible regulatory nerve. It would be hard to convince anyone that such an immediate about face in favor of the company that fought the previous merger the hardest isn\u2019t motivated by a desire to pick winners in losers in the marketplace or even outright cronyism. That would be true in almost any circumstance, but is doubly true now that T-Mobile is flourishing. It\u2019s hard to swallow the idea that it would harm competition if a nationwide wireless company were to buy T-Mobile \u2014 unless the purchaser is Sprint.\n\nThe special irony here is that Son has built his reputation on a knack for relentless innovation. When he bought Sprint, he expressed confidence that Sprint would become the number 1 company in the world. But, a year later, it is T-Mobile that is rebounding in the marketplace, even though T-Mobile has fewer customers than Sprint and less spectrum than Sprint. Buying into T-Mobile\u2019s success now wouldn\u2019t improve Son\u2019s reputation for innovation, but it would double down on his confidence. I expect US regulators will want to see how he does with Sprint before betting the wireless competition farm on a prodigal Son.", "423": "The stock market kept investors on their toes Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) and other major-market averages staying close to yesterday's closing levels as market participants waited for more news to help them decide the future course of the global economy and the sustainability of the 5-year-old bull market. By 12:30 p.m. EDT, the Dow was down 46 points; among its worst performers were AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which fell between 1% and 1.25%. For the Dow's two telecom giants, competition from reinvigorated rivals T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) has become a bigger threat lately, but do the smaller companies really have a chance to eat into Verizon's and AT&T's dominance of the industry?\n\nFighting the good fight\n\nRecently, there's been a huge escalation in the war among the four major telecom providers in the U.S., with smaller companies raising the volume level on the ongoing debate. One of the most vocal opponents of AT&T and Verizon is Masayoshi Son, president of SoftBank, which took a roughly 80% stake in Sprint last year. Son said recently that he would start a \"massive price war\" in the wireless industry if SoftBank is allowed to buy T-Mobile and merge it into Sprint, creating a carrier whose size would rival that of AT&T and Verizon. With his international perspective, Son recently noted how bad wireless service is in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world, even though fees here are among the highest.\n\nT-Mobile hasn't waited for a merger to happen before taking aggressive steps of its own. Last week, the company announced another pricing change, with CEO John Legere comparing Verizon and AT&T to loan sharks because of their low-data-limit plans. T-Mobile has a lot more to show from its efforts, gaining 4.4 million subscribers during 2013 compared to just modest gains for Sprint last year. Moreover, T-Mobile has inspired change from AT&T, with moves to de-emphasize subsidized plans becoming more common. Verizon seems resistant to that trend, but it's unclear how long it can hold out if customers get used to newer financing plans and other nonsubsidy methods of getting them to buy new phones.\n\nCan the big telecoms stay big?\n\nFor AT&T and Verizon, the good news is that most people never switch carriers even when superior plan options become available. According to consumer data from Parks Associates, almost half of mobile customers have stayed with their original provider for at least a decade, and only about one in eight have switched three or more times. That behavior effectively creates a competitive moat around Verizon and AT&T and their superior market share, but it doesn't mean that their leadership status is impregnable.\n\nStill, size presents its own challenges. Verizon recently tapped the bond market again with a $4.5 billion offering, and the huge amount of debt it incurred to take full control of Verizon Wireless could present it with substantial financing obstacles if interest rates rise by the time the debt comes due. With so many people looking to AT&T and Verizon for their dividends, any threat to those payouts could cause big problems down the road.\n\nThe telecom industry looks like it might be poised to underperform in the intermediate term, at least until industry players figure out how to position themselves for greater competition. In the long run, AT&T and Verizon could end up being a longer-term drag on the Dow's performance, despite their attractive dividends.", "424": "Boston, MA 03/11/2014 (wallstreetpr) \u2013 Speculation is ripe in the telecom industry on the purported merger between Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS). Sprint Corporation Chief executive Officer has already come out to confirm that his company is more than ready and willing to add T-Mobile under its portfolio.\n\nThe merger is expected to be the third largest in the telecom industry sure to give the big players in the industry a run for their money in terms of increased competition. This comes at the back of Sprint CEO saying, he would love to buy the smaller wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) despite the increasing opposition from regulators in the industry.\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) had made an offer to acquire T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) back in 2011 but its advances were thwarted by the authorities, this essentially leaves a lot to be seen of what verdict Sprint will get from the same authorities. The merger if it goes through will give the two entities enough capacity and infrastructure to deliver quality services to customers while at the same time minimizing on costs of operations.\n\nThe merger of the two companies will result in an entity with a market cap worth $60 billion that will still lag behind that of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\u2019s $196 billion and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) $168 billion. The entity will also command a total membership subscription of 56.7 million.\n\nImplications of the merger\n\nTechnical integration between the two companies could end up being a daunting hurdle considering the two companies use completely different technologies for their wireless networks. Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S) has been carrying out capital investments such as its Network Vision which is a three year project aimed at expanding its 4G LTE service coverage.\n\nT-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has on the other hand carried out 4G LTE technology expansion that now covers over 260 destinations in the U.S. The technologies used in the two companies are completely different with Sprint using CDMA while T-Mobile uses LTE and GSM.\n\nDebt management will be another hurdle for the merger as it will result in a total combined debt of $19 billion that will be extremely difficult to leverage. Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S)\u2019s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 129% with the merger expected to be carried out on a cash only basis estimated to be worth $26 billion.", "425": "Masayoshi Son, the chairman of Softbank, really wants to buy T-Mobile and merge it with Sprint. And he's used to getting what he wants.\n\nHaving been rebuffed by pretty much every relevant part of the U.S. government, he's now taking his case to the public. In an interview yesterday on the Charlie Rose show, he promised the public what they want: lower wireless prices.\n\nDon't listen to him.\n\nSon is hiding the complete organizational disaster that a Sprint/T-Mobile merger would become. Far from becoming a lean, mean, price-cutting machine, the company would drop into a horrifying, two-year-long vortex of technology and organizational integration. It would be Sprint/Nextel all over again.\n\nLook at what these companies would have: CDMA, GSM, and two varieties of LTE on 1700MHz, 1900MHz, 2600MHz, and a tiny little slice of 800MHz. There's very little overlap, and a ton of complexity. From the organizational perspective, you've got two companies with completely different corporate cultures and, together, more prepaid brands than you can shake a stick at.\n\nSprint is also in the middle of a complex, tricky network upgrade that everyone at the company says needs its undivided attention.\n\nI'm not saying that Son wouldn't be able to rationalize all of this ... eventually. I'm saying that the energy devoted to network building would shift to network integration, and the energy devoted to growth would shift to corporate integration. Demoralized employees would put out their resumes by the boatload before the tens of thousands of pink slips hit. All this was was true about Sprint/Nextel, it was true about Cingular/AT&T, and it'll be true here.\n\nA merger would probably be devastating to the Kansas City region. Son has been murmuring about his dissatisfaction with Sprint's KC-based leadership, and T-Mobile's headquarters in Seattle is much closer to Son's redoubt in Japan.\n\nCustomer service will plummet. The product line will do belly-flops as the company tries to rationalize its technologies. Do you think wireless service and prices would really improve coming from a company in such confusion? Maybe three years down the road, once its user base has been strip-mined by more focused AT&T and Verizon.\n\nT-Mobile also seems to be doing a pretty good job of offering low rates all by itself as an independent firm, which must be driving Son absolutely nuts. The smaller carrier is sending very mixed messages about a potential merger; T-Mobile's CFO Braxton Carter said he sees an eventual merger as inevitable, but a few months ago, T-Mobile CEO John Legere implied that he'd only OK a merger if it kept the T-Mobile brand and he ran the combined company.\n\nAnd as CNET's Maggie Reardon pointed out recently, a Sprint/T-Mobile merger would do absolutely zero to fix the two companies' biggest problems attracting customers: a lack of low-band spectrum and a lack of coverage outside major metro areas. There are 317 million people in the U.S. T-Mobile covers 209 million of them with LTE, and Sprint aims to cover 250 million by the end of this year - but AT&T and Verizon both have goals well over 300 million.\n\nOnce more, there are wireless mergers that make sense. Sprint/Dish would make sense from a technology perspective, as Dish has a lot of greenfield spectrum that it hasn't built anything on. (The problem there is Dish's Chairman.) T-Mobile/MetroPCS made sense because the two companies had similar spectrum layouts and MetroPCS wanted to get out of CDMA pronto. (Sprint doesn't.)\n\nBut merging Sprint and T-Mobile, especially with Sprint still in the middle of a network upgrade, would do a lot more for Masayoshi Son's ego than it would for American wireless consumers. It still needs to be stopped.\n\nFor more, check out 6 Reasons Sprint Shouldn't Buy T-Mobile.", "426": "If there was any question that T-Mobile was entertaining the idea of a Sprint merger, a recent statement by T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter hints that it could be all but inevitable.

According to them, T-Mobile has performing well enough to continue running by itself. But as Carter points out, \u201cTo take a third-scale national player that has the scale benefits with the right business model could be very competitively enhancing in the U.S..\u201d In other words, AT&T and Verizon should probably be watching their backs.\n\nSomething tells us they aren\u2019t too worried. It was back in 2011 that the US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission shot down AT&T\u2019s proposed buyout of T-Mobile for a cool $39 billion, leaving AT&T walking away bruised and broken. Sounds they wouldn\u2019t be too receptive of a Sprint/T-Mobile merger either.\n\nCarter goes onto say that the government can\u2019t simply have its cake and eat it too. \u201cIf they think there really needs to be four players in this market on a nationwide basis, they are going to have to put some structural protections to ensure an adequate distribution of spectrum.\u201d\n\nSprint has been gunning for T-Mobile for years now. In 2010, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse went on the record about merger talks with T-Mobile. In 2011, talks of a merger once again began rearing their head, followed by a recent report last December saying Sprint would offer upwards of $20 billion to buy T-Mobile this year, but was still feeling things out. Like that persistent dude in the movie theater, Sprint really wants T-Mobile\u2019s number.\n\nI guess John Legere never received the memo, T-Mobile\u2019s off-the-wall CEO who continued blasting away at rival carriers on Twitter. In a recent tweet, Legere specifically calls out Sprint saying, \u201cRemember when people actually liked @sprint? Yeah, me either.\u201d It\u2019s clear Sprint is going to need more than just Carly in tight leather to drawn in new customers. Upgrading their slow as molasses network would be a good start.\n\n[Reuters]", "427": "AFP, WASHINGTON\n\nThe Japanese owner of US mobile carrier Sprint Nextel Corp said on Monday that he wanted to launch a \u201cprice war\u201d with the two major carriers as he seeks to acquire T-Mobile\u2019s US unit.\n\nMasayoshi Son, the tycoon whose Softbank Corp holds a controling stake in Sprint, confirmed his reported interest in T-Mobile US Inc, whose parent company is Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom AG, in an interview on US public TV.\n\nSon, while declining to discuss details, said that he wanted to go head-to-head and undercut US giants AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, replicating his aggressive strategy of sacrificing short-term profit, while pursuing a greater market share.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the real fight, not the pseudo-fight,\u201d Son told The Charlie Rose Show.\n\n\u201cIf I can have the real fight, I go in a more massive price war,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be No. 1. So if we are No. 3, and if we have enough chance, I want to be No. 1. So I would go to price competition, very much aggressively.\u201d\n\nSprint, the third-ranking US carrier, closed a deal in July last year that gave Softbank a controling stake for US$21.6 billion \u2014 the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\n\nAny such deal would be expected to face close scrutiny by US regulators in charge of ensuring competition. AT&T in 2011 sought to buy T-Mobile for US$39 billion, but backed down in the face of regulatory opposition.", "428": "Boston, MA 03/11/2014 (wallstreetpr) \u2013 The tussle to acquire more membership subscription in the US wireless market seems to be hitting up after T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) decided to carry out price cuts in an effort of out doing AT&T in the industry. T-Mobile has reduced prices for its 2GB Mobile share plan by 2% which will now go on sale at $65. The new offer will be exclusive to customers who subscribe to the company\u2019s 4G LTE service.\n\nT-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) consumers will now enjoy unlimited talk time and text time with 2GB worth of data, under the new offer. AT&T on its part has opted to do away with its premium pricing and will consequently reduce its mobile share price plans as it tries to keep up with T-Mobile. The price wars is sure to interest consumers who will now find it easy, to switch between data plans that include a combination of both unlimited talk time and messaging.\n\nT-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has also raised the prices of its highest tier to $80 a month up from the usual $70. T-Mobile price cuts come as a surprise as it has been differentiating itself from premium priced competitors such as Verizon. T-Mobile has raised prices for its services as a way of keeping up with increased capital expenditure which has more than quadrupled since 2010.\n\nT-Mobile might be bought by Sprint\n\nReports in the industry indicate that Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son is more than eager to purchase T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS), despite the move already facing opposition from regulators. Son has been quoted as saying the merger of the two companies will more than improve their ability to compete the industry giants Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nSon led a $21.6 billion buyout of sprint last year and is seen as the only player in the industry with the capacity of purchasing T-Mobile having out bid Dish network for the acquisition of Sprint. Acquisition of T-Mobile has already faced scrutiny in the past especially after AT&T had proposed such a move in 2011. It is being reported that Sprint move to acquire T-Mobile has already been taunted as questionable by the Justice and Federal communications Commission.\n\nThe merger if it goes through will be the third largest in the telecom industry sure to be more than capable in challenging Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in the industry.", "429": "SoftBank Corp. President Masayoshi Son will start a \u201cmassive price war\u201d if U.S. regulators allow his company to purchase T-Mobile US Inc., he said in an interview with PBS\u2019s Charlie Rose.\n\nThe billionaire, who bought control of Sprint Corp. last year, said combining the third- and fourth-largest U.S. mobile- phone carriers would give him enough scale to compete against larger operators AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nSon, 56, said he was willing to postpone profit to gain market share and would use price cuts to draw users. He has met resistance to a T-Mobile deal from U.S. regulators skeptical that cutting the number of national wireless carriers to three would promote competition.\n\n\u201cWe need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK,\u201d Son said during the interview with Rose, airing nationally in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\u201d\n\nSon, who is the chairman of Sprint, said he also wants to upgrade infrastructure to provide for faster Internet access in the U.S. He is reframing his argument for consolidation in the U.S. mobile-phone market this week to advocate for wireless broadband as an alternative to cable.\n\nPricing Strategy\n\nThe U.S. has about 200 million mobile broadband users, the highest number of all countries, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst at Chetan Sharma Consulting. Last year, average mobile data use almost doubled to 1.2 gigabytes from 690 megabytes, he said.\n\nSoftBank rose 1.6 percent to 8,098 yen at 10:30 a.m. in Tokyo trading. Sprint added 0.9 percent Monday and T-Mobile gained 0.6 percent Monday.\n\nWhen Son acquired Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s Japan unit in April 2006, the struggling carrier faced two larger rivals. He changed pricing to revive growth and upgraded networks to send video and other data.\n\nWithin six months of completing the deal, he dropped the Vodafone brand in favor of the SoftBank label, a name then best- known in Japan as the nation\u2019s second-largest Internet service provider.\n\nSoftBank Growth\n\n\u201cWhat SoftBank did in Japan was to become focused on taking costs out of the business and challenging every line item,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst at New Street Research LLC in London said March 7. \u201cThat gives them the flexibility to be more competitive on price and network.\u201d\n\nSon also made SoftBank the first Japanese carrier to offer Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone. The company tapped Hollywood stars to promote its brand, hiring actors Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones to spearhead advertising campaigns.\n\nThe moves helped. When Son bought the wireless business, it had about 15 percent of the market and 16 million subscribers. At the end of February, it had 25 percent of the market and 35 million users.\n\nSoftBank outgrew both its rivals in new users every year from 2008 to 2013, and its market value has more than quadrupled to $94.2 billion since June 2008, when the company announced it would start offering the iPhone.\n\nSon is attempting to change the public perception of a potential deal for T-Mobile, said Makoto Kikuchi, Tokyo-based chief executive officer for Myojo Asset Management Co. Consumers would welcome more price competition, he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge success for SoftBank if they use a price war as their strategy and then revive Sprint and T- Mobile,\u201d Kikuchi said.", "430": "The CEO of Sprint owner SoftBank said he'll start a \"massive price war\" if his company can purchase T-Mobile US.\n\nSprint is attempting to buy T-Mobile but hasn't reached an agreement yet. Even if it does, it could face opposition from a Federal Communications Commission that blocked AT&T's bid to purchase T-Mobile in 2011.\n\n\"We'd like to make a deal, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,\" SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son said on the Charlie Rose show this week. Rose suggested to Son that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler might not want Sprint to buy T-Mobile because it would reduce wireless competition, but Son said that Sprint and T-Mobile today are \"two little ones who are not able to fight without enough scale.\"\n\nA combined Sprint/T-Mobile would turn the market into a \"three heavyweight fight,\" Son said. \"I would like to have the real fight, not a pseudo fight, the real fight,\" he said. \"If I can have a real fight, I go in [with a] more massive price war.\"\n\nRose followed up by asking, \"That's your pattern? You undersell everybody, you're willing to postpone profits in order to gain market share?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I want to be #1,\" Son responded. \"If we were #3, and if we had enough chance, I want to be #1.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed out on Sunday that T-Mobile's aggressive moves haven't lowered bill prices across the industry. \"Competition in the US wireless market has increased over the past year, but so have Americans' overall phone bills,\" the newspaper wrote. \"While carriers have trimmed the price of their plans here and there in recent months, billings per user continue to grow amid a shift to smartphones and a surge in wireless Internet use. The results call into question the notion of a price war in the US market. Rather than aggressively compete outright on price, carriers are tailoring their moves to accomplish other goals as well, like weaning customers off expensive smartphone subsidies and encouraging them to use more data.\"\n\nA recent survey found that Sprint customers' average bill price is $144 per month, second highest to Verizon Wireless's $148. Those numbers include both single users and family plan customers. T-Mobile's average price of $120 was lowest among the four major US carriers.", "431": "Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son wants to buy Bellevue-based T-Mobile, in part so he can launch a \u201cmassive price war\u201d against rivals Verizon and AT&T. Son, the president of SoftBank, made the remarks in an appearance on Charlie Rose.\n\n\u201cWe need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK,\u201d Son said in the interview with Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\u201d\n\nIn Japan with SoftBank, Son used aggressive pricing tactics to compete with its rivals.\n\nUnder the guidance of T-Mobile boss John Legere, the wireless carrier has set out on a mission to upend the wireless industry, a strategy that appears to be working.\n\nSon is making the rounds in the U.S., trying to drum up support for the idea of combining Sprint (No. 3 wireless carrier in the U.S.) with T-Mobile (No. 4). Today, he plans to deliver a talk in Washington D.C. to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nChatter of regulatory headwinds have slowed a potential deal between the two carriers. William J. Baer, an Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, said in an interview with the New York Times earlier this year that it would be \u201chard for someone to make a persuasive case that reducing four firms to three is actually going to improve competition for the benefit of American consumers.\u201d FCC Chair Tom Wheeler is also skeptical of a merger, according to a report from Reuters.\n\nLast month, word spread that Sprint was lining up as much as $45 billion to make a run at T-Mobile. Here\u2019s a look at how the industry has consolidated over the past 10 years, reduced from seven to just four main players. T-Mobile has been part of that consolidation wave in the past, buying Metro PCS in 2012. Meanwhile, as you may recall, AT&T canceled its $39 billion bid for T-Mobile in 2011 after running into regulatory walls.", "432": "Howard Stern and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere may operate in completely different businesses, but the phone company boss has learned a lesson from the radio shock jock.\n\nNo T-Mobile hasn't started spanking strippers or having its staff make phony calls. Instead the company -- through its CEO -- is taking shots at its bigger rivals. Stern -- when he was a much lesser-known personality working in local markets -- did exactly the same thing. The man now known to his fans as the \"King of All Media\" would identify the top DJs in the market he was entering and ruthlessly attack them on the air.\n\nEither the competitors themselves or the local media would pick up on the taunting and turn a one-sided fight into an actual war. Stern would immediately be elevated to contender status simply by being linked to the current leader as a competitor. Legere is doing exactly the same thing as he seeks to make T-Mobile a player in a field dominated by AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S).\n\nT-Mobile CEO gets aggressive\n\nLegere took a shot at his competitors on March 7 in a press release announcing a pricing change for T-Mobile.\n\n\"In the mobile age, wireless data caps and overage fees are just this side of extortion,\" said Legere. \"Take the basic plans from the Big Two with ridiculously low data limits that hit you with fat overages each month. It's like getting your data from the neighborhood loan shark and paying 100% interest when the bill comes due. It's the classic shakedown.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Legere has taken a shot at his rivals. By going after his competitors and not just offering an alternative but mocking the status quo, Legere is getting the media to pay attention.\n\nWhen Stern did that it inevitably ended in a funeral -- a live radio show where the controversial host mock-buried his competitor when Stern became number one in the market. Whether T-Mobile has any funerals in its future for competitors remains to be seen, but Legere certainly has made it feel like his team is in the game.\n\nWhere the cell phone industry stands\n\nIn the United States Verizon has about 31% market share, AT&T has about 27%, while Sprint and T-Mobile each have around 11%, according to Gary Kim, writing at Techzone360.com. The major challenge facing any carrier hoping to steal market share from the big two is that despite the many commercials attempting to get them to do so -- customers don't switch providers very often.\n\nParks Associates consumer data show that almost 50% of U.S. mobile phone service customers did not change providers over the last 10 years. \"Fully half of the customer base virtually never changes providers, meaning that all switching behavior is concentrated on just half the total subscriber base,\" the research company reported .\n\nOnly 13% of subscribers switched three times or more in the last 10 years.\n\n\"The real battle to shift consumer allegiance would be fought over about 13% of customers, disproportionately concentrated among prepaid accounts,\" the Parks Associates report said.\n\nIt's certainly possible T-Mobile can lure people who rarely switch, but it's less likely. That makes making an assault on the big two a daunting task that may benefit from Legere's big talk.\n\nSprint may change the game\n\nSprint also wants to take on the big two, and one of its strategies is to buy T-Mobile. That merger is far from certain as T-Mobile may fight the move and federal regulators will look at it closely. Though the combined companies would still service fewer mobile subscribers than AT&T and Verizon, the FCC has been against the idea of more consolidation in the space, Geekwire reported.\n\nThe Justice Department and the FCC have said, according to Geekwire, that they're happy with the number of players in the wireless market and don't really want to see it shrink from four to three major carriers.\n\n\"It is arguable that the industry has in fact become more competitive for the industry's top two companies, as #3 and #4 players Sprint and T-Mobile have strengthened their competing nationwide networks with ongoing buildouts and spectrum acquisitions (i.e., T-Mobile's acquisition of MetroPCS and Sprint's acquisition of Clearwire),\" Goldman analysts told Geekwire. \"This has enabled them to be more competitive vs. Verizon and AT&T in key urban markets than previously, a dynamic that could continue to keep a lid on industry margins near term despite a very high level of consolidation.\"\n\nA Sprint/T-Mobile merger or acquisition may not change the aggressive nature of T-Mobile's attempt to compete, as Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son has not exactly been kind in his description of the big two.\n\n\"Every time I make a business trip to the U.S., I am reminded how terrible connections are there,\" Son told the Wall Street Journal. \"The U.S. has one of the world's highest mobile fees.\"\n\nT-Mobile is on the right track\n\nT-Mobile added more than 1.6 million customers in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a total of 4.4 million for the year. Sprint only added 682,000 new subscribers in the fourth quarter and lost subscribers in two of the three previous quarters (finishing the year up slightly).\n\nWith its bold CEO who talks tough and commercials that clearly take aim at the big boys, T-Mobile has found a winning strategy to claw its way forward in the increasingly competitive mobile space. By acting like he deserves a seat at the grownups' table, Legere has baited his competitors to lower prices, change plans, and generally acknowledge T-Mobile as a player.\n\nThat may not lead to a Legere movie, a book deal, or a funeral for AT&T or Verizon, but it should keep T-Mobile growing.", "433": "While AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon have overhauled their wireless plans and slashed prices, Sprint has mostly sat on the sidelines.\n\nBut that could change if Sprint is allowed to acquire T-Mobile, at least according to Masayoshi Son, Sprint's chairman and the president of Sprint majority shareholder SoftBank.\n\n\u201cWe need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK,\u201d Son said in an interview with PBS's Charlie Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\u201d\n\nIs three better than four?\n\nSon is likely trying to sweet-talk regulators during a visit to the United States. Although Softbank and T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telecom haven't finalized a deal, regulation is seen as the biggest hurdle for a potential merger. Just a couple years ago, AT&T abandoned its T-Mobile takeover plans after facing stiff resistance from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC argued that four major carriers are necessary to promote competition in the wireless market.\n\nT-Mobile bounced back after the failed merger, offering cheaper service than the major carriers while eliminating the smartphone subsidies that lead to inflated rates. T-Mobile also added an early upgrade program for smartphones (since mimicked by AT&T and Verizon), free texting and data use while overseas, a small amount of free data for tablet users, and big incentives for families to switch from other carriers.\n\nT-Mobile's moves have triggered an all-out price war. AT&T and Verizon slashed prices for their respective early upgrade plans, and AT&T started offering $15 per month discounts for users who bring their own phones. Verizon slapped a $10 discount on some of its cheaper two-year contract plans, and this week AT&T cut the price of its basic 2 GB plan by $15 per month. AT&T and Verizon both started offering free texting to international numbers\u2014a move that T-Mobile then duplicated this week.\n\nSprint stays (mostly) silent\n\nUsually, carriers take turns flogging their customers with policy changes, such as killing unlimited data and curbing early upgrade privileges. The amount of consumer-friendly changes that carriers have enacted over several months is staggering.\n\nBut through it all, Sprint has made very little noise. The carrier flirted with an early upgrade program that actually made sense, but discontinued it after just four months. Sprint is now trying to push \u201cFramily\u201d plans, where people can pay separate bills and still share in big discounts. The plans are actually quite cheap\u2014starting at just $55 per month for a single line\u2014but the marketing angle of roping in your friends seems convoluted and just a little desperate. The fact that you can't sign up for a Framily plan online only adds confusion.\n\nThere's an argument to be made for allowing Sprint and T-Mobile to merge, but it's harder to swallow when Sprint doesn't look like a carrier that wants to keep up with its competitors. As for Masayoshi Son's promises of a price war, we've already got one.\n\nThis story, \"AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile are waging price war, but where's Sprint?\" was originally published by TechHive .", "434": "Softbank chairman Masayoshi Son, the swashbuckling Japanese entrepreneur-investor who in 2012 bought mobile carrier Sprint, is coming to Washington. He\u2019s coming because he\u2019d also like to acquire T-Mobile, America\u2019s fourth largest mobile firm, but the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission are waving off the potential merger. So Son, in a round of Beltway speeches on Tuesday, is expected to lay out his plan to combine Sprint and T-Mobile and rescue the American mobile industry from the doldrums.\n\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cnetwork is not good,\u201d Mr. Son recently remarked. \u201cEvery time I make a business trip to the U.S.,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI am reminded how terrible connections are there.\u201d A Sprint-T-Mobile merger would, he thinks, boost America\u2019s piddly mobile investments, speeds, and innovation. Mr. Son\u2019s compassion would be touching \u2014 except that his characterization of U.S. mobile is a bunch of nonsensu (\u30ce\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9).\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U.S. needs to clear more wireless spectrum \u2014 the radio waves that carry signals \u2014 to both accommodate the current flood of mobile data and drive future innovation. But the urgent need for more spectrum mostly shows how much positive momentum American mobile enjoys. Mr. Son should get his merger. But not for the reason he states. The notion that U.S. broadband and mobile are lagging is simply false, and dangerous \u2014 because it it being used as a pretext for massive new regulation of the Internet economy.\n\nAs we have shown, the U.S. generates and consumes more Internet data (per capita and per user) than any nation but South Korea. Its broadband speeds are the fastest of any non-small nation, and in its non-rural states, speeds are among the very fastest in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to mobile in particular, America leads the world.\n\nThe U.S. has deployed more 4G networks and 4G devices than anyone. Lots more. More than 95% of Americans have access to 4G LTE networks (the fastest, most advanced network standard), and by mid-2013 Americans enjoyed as many 4G LTE connections than the rest of the world combined. Japan\u2019s largest mobile carrier NTT Docomo expects to cover just 70% of its population with 4G LTE by 2015. At the end of 2013, 30% of U.S. connections were 4G, compared to just 2% in the EU.\n\nThe U.S. has 290 million mobile subscriptions that are either 3G or 4G (the third and fourth generation wireless standards), accounting for 92% of the American population, the highest proportion in the world. Japan is next at 84%, and most other nations lag far behind. Germany, for example, is at 56%.\n\nIn 2013, U.S. broadband firms invested $34 billion in mobile networks and another $35-plus billion in wired networks. The U.S., with 5% of the world\u2019s mobile users, invests 24% of all global wireless capex dollars. (With 4% of the world\u2019s population, the U.S. accounts for 25% of all broadband investment.)\n\nU.S. mobile users generate and consume more data traffic per capita than anyone except the Japanese. The U.S. generates twice the mobile traffic (per capita) of Western Europe. Surprisingly, per capita U.S. mobile traffic tops even South Korea, long a leader in mobile infrastructure and adoption.\n\nU.S. mobile users talk four to five times as much as their Western European counterparts (measured in voice minutes) and send six times as many text messages.\n\nData prices in the U.S., meanwhile, have plunged 93% over the last five years, to just three cents per megabyte ($0.03/MB).\n\nBecause of its vast geography and low-density population, covering the U.S. with wireless infrastructure is far more difficult and expensive, making these accomplishments all the more impressive.\n\nMr. Son says a Sprint-T-Mobile merger would present a more effective competitor to wired broadband providers like the cable MSOs. He\u2019s right that wireless is an increasingly effective partial substitute for wired broadband. But the key limiting factor is spectrum \u2014 where Mr. Son\u2019s own Sprint already reigns as spectrum king \u2014 not a failure of investment, technology, or too little oversight from Washington. Sprint and T-Mobile, moreover, are the chief advocates of special rules that would prevent their mobile rivals from acquiring more spectrum. Mr. Son cannot both argue that wireless is an important competitor to wired broadband and also seek special favors that block his wireless competitors (AT&T and Verizon) from the ability to compete.\n\nPerhaps the most important manifestation of the healthy U.S. mobile arena is our flourishing market in content, apps, and services. The Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems started here and have now spread across the world. The combination of smartphones, tablets, and apps created new software and content industries, centered in the U.S. And although the valuations of some Silicon Valley mobile and Internet start ups may seem frothy or even ridiculous, they are a sign of vibrancy that exists in few other places on earth.\n\nLess heralded but no less important are the rippling mobile innovations spreading into every industry and sector, from health and education to autos, agriculture, aviation, and more.\n\nCalls for mobile market share and spectrum limits, regulation of Internet interconnection agreements, and even a great leap backward to the hyper-regulatory environment of Title II telephones are downright weird. Old time regulation has no place on the wild and fast-paced Internet, and it threatens to slow one of America\u2019s few high-revving economic engines. The chief argument of those pushing these government impositions on the Internet is the absurdity that the U.S. digital economy is broken. Mr. Son may not know it, but trashing the U.S. mobile and broadband markets could lead to policies that render his American communications assets far less valuable.", "435": "In a television interview yesterday evening, Sprint Chairman, and SoftBank CEO, Masayoshi Son confirmed that he was interested in a deal to buy T-Mobile. The deal would combine Sprint and T-Mobile in some form of merger and help bring them in to a \u201creal fight\u201d with AT&T and Verizon. He believes a deal would create a \u201cmassive price war\u201d between the nation\u2019s four biggest carriers.\n\nOf course, he knows that a merger isn\u2019t going to be plain-sailing. And the company\u2019s interest hasn\u2019t materialized in to an official bid of any kind. But the interest is real. Seemingly, the only element hindering a potential buyout is what the regulators make of it. In early \u201ctesting the water\u201d talks with the FCC and Department of Justice, the feeling has been that neither would be entirely supportive of a buyout. SoftBank has to be able to prove that this is in the best interests of the American consumer.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing for months about a supposed bid for T-Mobile by SoftBank CEO, Masayoshi Son, but haven\u2019t heard anything officially confirming the interest. That is, until now. Both companies have \u2013 in fact \u2013 been making moves towards this deal for at least 2-3 months now. We heard that Son had approached several major banks to finance the deal, which won\u2019t be cheap. T-Mobile is now worth just under $50 billion after a very successful 2013. Deutsche Telekom \u2013 oddly \u2013 moved its T-Mobile stake to an account in the Netherlands to help with interest/value/and currency conversion, making it a more favorable deal. A similar move was made by Vodafone, shortly after the announcement was made that it would sell its 45% share in Verizon back to the American wireless carrier.\n\nThey say there\u2019s no smoke without fire. We\u2019ve been seeing the smoke for months, and now we\u2019re seeing the tips of the flame. SoftBank is interested in buying T-Mobile. That may come as bad news to Team Magenta, but I think it\u2019s worse news for Sprint. Tmo is the \u201ccool\u201d brand of the two. It\u2019s the network that\u2019s causing the biggest disturbance, both in terms of value, and what its upcoming 20+20 LTE network is capable of. It\u2019s adding as many new customers each month as Verizon, the #1 carrier. If a merger goes through, let\u2019s hope that Son decides Legere should stay on as CEO, and T-Mobile swallows up Sprint. Not the other way around.\n\nVia: WSJ", "436": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has officially put a target on the backs of AT&T and Verizon.\n\nSpeaking to Charlie Rose in an interview Monday, Son said that he'd \"like to have the real fight\" for mobile supremacy, adding that if he can get to that point, he would enter into \"a more massive price war.\"\n\nSoftBank, which acquired a controlling stake in Sprint last year, is reportedly mulling a merger with T-Mobile USA to create a more competitive alternative to the big two of AT&T and Verizon. But Son's comments suggest he also wants to undercut his competitors on price, sacrificing profits in the short term to maximize market share over the long term.\n\nSon didn't mention any plans to acquire T-Mobile, but his visit to the US this week is viewed as a lobbying trip to entice policymakers to accept such a merger. Son will be speaking in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, discussing his belief that large, competitive wireless carriers can be strong competitors to broadband providers in the consumer market. In order for his company to reach that level of competitiveness, Sprint would likely need T-Mobile's help.\n\nWhether Son can actually get a deal done, however, remains to be seen. The US government has already examined the idea of a wireless merger involving T-Mobile -- and quickly struck it down in 2011 when AT&T made a $39 billion bid for T-Mobile. It appears Son's latest efforts are designed to make his case before SoftBank and Sprint make a run for the fourth-largest US carrier.\n\n(Via AFP)", "437": "Stock Market Headlines:\n\nStock futures veered lower today, as investors struggled for direction amid a dearth of pivotal data and as global markets put in a mostly subdued performance.

The merger, according to Son, will give him enough scale to offer substantial competition to the two leading US carriers - AT&T and Verizon.\n\nSon said during the interview, which will be telecast nationally in the US: \"We need a certain scale, but once we have enough scale to have a level fight, OK. It's a three-heavyweight fight. If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\"\n\nAsserting that he would use 'price war' as the key strategy to challenge AT&T and Verizon if SoftBank's T-Mobile purchase is approved by US regulators, 56-year-old Son said that he wouldn't mind postponing profit to gain market share; and added that he would use price cuts to attract customers.\n\nAs of now, the US regulators are somewhat skeptical about approving SoftBank's T-Mobile acquisition because they are not convinced by the argument that reducing the number of national wireless carriers from four to three would promote competition.", "439": "Japanese tech titan SoftBank bought Sprint last year and now it really wants to buy T-Mobile.

If I can have a real fight, I go in more massive price war, a technology war.\u201d\n\nMasayoshi Son is making the atypical move of promising to postpone a focus on profit in order to gain market share and deliver price cuts for a very specific reason: U.S. regulators are hesitant to allow the Sprint-T-Mobile merger. T-Mobile has recently delivered clear and substantial price cuts to consumers and AT&T has been forced to follow suit. There is some concern that if Sprint and T-Mobile are combined, the recent trend of price-cutting may sputter out.\n\nT-Mobile is already driving new pricing initiatives in America \u2014 why risk a period of stagnation that might follow a merger?\n\nPerhaps because SoftBank has a track record of offering radical, even shocking price innovation in Japan, which used to be utterly dominated by NTT DoCoMo. SoftBank was so aggressive during the arrival of number portability in Japan in 2007 that DoCoMo was forced to literally halve the prices of some of its two-year phone plans. In 2008, SoftBank courted Apple aggressively and brought the iPhone to Japan, helping it extend the market share gains it had started racking up with the help of a contract price war.\n\nSoftBank does have a history of innovative new pricing plans, substantial investment in advanced handset technology and just raw pricing aggression in Japan. It will be interesting to see if this is enough to persuade U.S. regulators to greenlight the Sprint-T-Mobile merger.", "440": "President of Japan's mobile carrier Softbank Masayoshi Son at a news conference announcing Softbank will acquire US-based Sprint Nextel in Tokyo on October 15, 2012. Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/File The Japanese owner of US mobile carrier Sprint said Monday he wanted to launch a \"price war\" with the two major carriers as he seeks to acquire T-Mobile's US unit.\n\nMasayoshi Son, the tycoon whose SoftBank company holds a controlling stake in Sprint, confirmed his reported interest in T-Mobile, whose parent company is Germany's Deutsche Telekom, in an interview broadcast on US public television.\n\nSon, while declining to discuss details, said that he wanted to go head-to-head and undercut US giants AT&T and Verizon, replicating his aggressive strategy of sacrificing short-term profit while pursuing a greater market share.\n\n\"I would like to have the real fight, not the pseudo-fight,\" Son told \"The Charlie Rose Show.\"\n\n\"If I can have the real fight, I go in a more massive price war,\" he said.\n\n\"I want to be number one. So if we are number three, and if we have enough chance, I want to be number one. So I would go to price competition, very much aggressively,\" he said.\n\nSprint, the third-ranking US carrier, closed a deal in July that allowed SoftBank to take a controlling stake for $21.6 billion -- the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\n\nJapan's Nikkei business daily reported in December that SoftBank was in talks to acquire T-Mobile US, which would make it the world's second largest mobile carrier after China Mobile.\n\nBut any such deal would be expected to face close scrutiny by US regulators in charge of ensuring competition. AT&T in 2011 sought to buy T-Mobile for $39 billion but backed down in the face of regulatory opposition.", "441": "If Sprint Corp. (NYSE: S) merges with T-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS), the company the transaction would create would still be smaller than AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) or Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), America\u2019s two largest wireless carriers. And it would remain as financially troubled as the two companies that would create it. Even on the long chance that regulators would approve such a deal, it is hard to see why the merger would be good for shareholders or customers. Putting together the two firms would be a logistics nightmare.\n\nSprint\u2019s chairman, Masayoshi Son, also the head of Japan\u2019s Softbank, told newsman Charlie Rose that, \u201cWe would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile claims it added 4.4 million customers last year, which would put its total at 47 million. Sprint has 54 million, so between them, the companies have 100 million, assuming there is no duplication. That is short of Verizon\u2019s 103 million and AT&T\u2019s 110 million. More importantly, the merged company would face tremendous hurdles putting together customer bases and creating a new brand identity.\n\nSprint has been widely criticized for its 2005 buyout of Nextel. The Nextel network was finally shuttered in 2012. Over the period, Sprint lost billions of dollars as it struggled to maintain two networks, two brands and two customers bases. These two customer bases paid different fees and had different subscription plans from one another.\n\nT-Mobile has decided to take on its larger competitors through a series of deep discounts in an effort to draw customers from the other three carriers. While this may have worked initially, most analysts believe it will trigger financial losses. T-Mobile may never be able to raise the rates it charges those customers. If it does, some of them will leave. Its balance sheet cannot compare to AT&T\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s, and neither can Sprint\u2019s.\n\nAT&T and Verizon have several advantages that no competitor can match. Each has a well-established network. Each has been in business for years using the same brands, the same retail store outlets and parent companies that offer other products that create diversification and financial strength. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile cannot come close to matching the other two with their huge landline, broadband fiber and business-to-business operations. And what would customers face? A company with a new and unfamiliar name. Retail stores closed in a consolidation? Two networks that may not work together?\n\nA T-Mobile merger with Sprint would take years to integrate properly, if it could be.

The median estimate represents a -13.89% decrease from the previous close.", "444": "SoftBank Corp. President Masayoshi Son is reframing his argument for consolidation in the U.S. mobile-phone market, heading to Washington this week to advocate for wireless broadband as an alternative to cable.\n\nAddressing investors and technology policy makers at a lunch tomorrow, Son plans to outline the advantages of an advanced wireless network that could deliver ultra-fast Internet access across the country and improve education and mobile commerce, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan is private.\n\nSon is not planning to make a direct appeal for a merger of Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc., the third- and fourth-largest U.S. mobile-phone carriers, these people said.\n\nThe billionaire, who is said to be considering an offer for T-Mobile after buying control of Sprint last year, has met resistance from regulators who are skeptical that shrinking the number of national wireless carriers to three would promote competition. He's now trying to reframe the argument around the emergence of a new option for Internet in the home, said Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst with Wells Fargo & Co. That would allow Son to focus on competing against landline Internet companies that currently have few or no rivals.\n\n\"In most markets you have one or two choices for broadband. SoftBank's strategy is to convince the FCC and DOJ that a strengthened No. 3 player can compete with cable,\" Fritzsche said in a phone interview, referring to the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. \"The key to this will be finding a way to make it politically palatable so it doesn't look like regulators are doing an about- face on the four-player market preference.\"\n\nInternet Alternative\n\nSoftBank fell 0.8 percent to 7,973 yen in Tokyo, extending its decline of 13 percent so far this year. The Topix index also fell 0.8 percent today.\n\nBy expanding the argument to broadband, Son is positioning a bigger wireless broadband provider as an alternative for consumers who today only have two major choices for Internet at home: their landline phone company, such as Verizon Communications Inc., or a cable-TV company, like Comcast Corp.\n\nComcast recently agreed to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for $45.2 billion in stock in a deal that combines the two largest U.S. cable companies. That means Son's argument for greater broadband competition comes at a time when regulators are likely analyzing the impact of cable consolidation on consumers' choices for Internet and TV service in the future.\n\n'Inevitable' Consolidation\n\nA representative for SoftBank declined to comment on the presentation or provide an advanced copy of the speech. The Tokyo-based company sent out an invitation last week to the event, saying Son will discuss \"the state of America's wireless communications industry and the competitive global landscape.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old founder of Japan's SoftBank argued during a January meeting with antitrust officials that merging T-Mobile with Sprint would allow for more aggressive competition against large carriers AT&T Inc. and Verizon.\n\nConsolidation is \"inevitable given the predatory duopoly structure here in the U.S.,\" T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said at an investor conference last week. He reiterated that T-Mobile, which is 67 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, is being run for the long term. T-Mobile had a market value of about $25 billion last week.\n\nIf T-Mobile remains independent and if U.S. regulators are committed to a four-company wireless market, there have to be rules about how new airwaves will be divvied up in an auction, Carter said today at a separate conference. He used the auction as an example of where the two dominant companies -- AT&T and Verizon -- are able to exert their resources and size to secure more radio waves.\n\nTough Sell\n\nDeutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Timotheus Hoettges said last week that a recovering outlook in the U.S. means T- Mobile can go it alone, at least for now. He told a supervisory board meeting that regulatory hurdles in the U.S. could hurt the chances of a sale of T-Mobile, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nDeutsche Telekom shares fell 0.9 percent to 11.44 euros at the close in Frankfurt.\n\nT-Mobile was little changed at $30.82 at 1:12 p.m. New York time, while Sprint fell 0.8 percent to $8.56.\n\nSon's argument for the bid is that the scale of Verizon and AT&T will stand in the way of a strong third competitor unless Sprint can acquire T-Mobile, said Neil Juggins, a Hong Kong- based analyst at JI Asia Research Ltd. Recently, consumers have benefited from new discount wireless plans sparked by T-Mobile's aggressive prices.\n\n\"It's going to be tough,\" Juggins said. \"It's going to be very hard to persuade the FCC and the American consumer.\"\n\nT-Mobile Gains\n\nIn the past year, Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile became the first carrier to introduce quicker phone upgrades, payment financing, international data and text messaging at no extra charge and a $450 credit program for customers that switch service. The moves helped T-Mobile gain 2.1 million monthly customers in the past three quarters.\n\nIn response, each of the bigger rivals, including Sprint, have either altered data allotments and prices or introduced new plans in an effort to keep customers.\n\nInstead of continuing to challenge regulators' preference for four companies in the U.S. wireless market, Son will probably aim his argument at the far less competitive arena of home broadband, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG LLC.\n\nBroadband Competitor\n\n\"They would like to position Sprint/T-Mobile, not just as a competitor to AT&T and Verizon, but as a new competitor to the broadband industry if they were allowed to merge,\" Piecyk said. \"SoftBank will try and show that it knows where the future is heading, and that with more scale, it can be the competition needed in the landline broadband industry.\"\n\nThe U.S. has about 200 million mobile broadband users, the highest number of all countries, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst at Chetan Sharma Consulting. Last year average mobile data use almost doubled to 1.2 gigabytes from 690 megabytes, he said.\n\nWhile landline broadband holds an inherent performance advantage, mobile broadband can offer a different model that could be cheaper and available in more places, Sharma said.\n\n\"The monopolies are more entrenched in the landline world, and there's less incentive for reduction of pricing versus mobile, where the competition is more intense,\" he said.\n\nWhen Son took over SoftBank from Vodafone Group Plc in April 2006, he had a plan to reinvent Japan's struggling third- ranked carrier. He changed pricing to revive growth and upgraded networks to send video and other data.\n\nSoftBank's Evolution\n\nWithin six months of completing the deal, he dropped the Vodafone brand in favor of the SoftBank label, a name then best- known in Japan as the nation's second-largest Internet service provider.\n\nSon also made SoftBank the first Japanese carrier to offer the iPhone. The company tapped Hollywood stars to promote its brand, hiring actors Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones to spearhead advertising campaigns.\n\nChanging the image wasn't enough to revive growth. Son worked to improve its network in response to rising demand from customers to send video and other data. SoftBank has increased its base stations for Japan services more than 10-fold since 2006, according to the company. That compares to a tripling for NTT Docomo Inc.\n\nThe moves helped. When Son bought the wireless business, it had about 15 percent of the market and 16 million subscribers. At the end of February, it had 25 percent of the market and 35 million users.\n\nSon's Vision\n\nSoftBank outgrew both its rivals in new users every year from 2008 to 2013, and its market value has more than quadrupled to $93.4 billion since June 2008 when the company announced it would start offering the iPhone.\n\nNow, Son will try to bring the culture of shopping on smartphones to the U.S., the same way he did in Japan, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo.\n\n\"Son wants to introduce mobile Internet to the U.S.,\" Yasuda said. \"It worked well in Japan. Ten years ago, nobody believed we would buy goods with smartphones, but Son had a vision and he will try to do the same in the U.S.\"", "445": "It is interesting to find out who in the online gambling industry may be in the best place to take advantage of huge data resources available for profit. An article recently revealed by The Hill in Washington D.C. in the Hill\u2019s technological blog that Masayoshi Son, the Chief Excecutive Officer of SoftBank, is speaking at the Chamber of Commerce in the Capital.\n\nSoftBank was established in Tokyo, Japan on September 3, 1981, and had a market capitalization of approximately US $43.52 billion as of March 2011. SoftBank Corp. is a Japanese telecommunications and Internet corporation, with operations in broadband, fixed-line telecommunication, e-commerce, Internet, broadmedia, technology services, finance, media and marketing, and other businesses.\n\nThis one massive company that has its interests firmly rooted in technology and of course information technology that allows the firm to data source from many angles. After Masayoshi Son speaks to the Chamber of Commerce the tech company chief executives will participate in a roundtable discussion on ways to grow \u201cthe data economy.\u201d\n\nThe data economy has been the biggest thing since sliced bread for firms such as Google and others which keep the information they have gathered to themselves to further their own aims. One can only suggest that this giant firm with its game developing capabilities and deep pockets will one day become one of Asia\u2019s biggest online gambling service providers. Speculation about the changes in the Japanese gambling market have been floating around for some time but as yet there has been no action.\n\nIt is possible though once a company such as SoftBank connects the dots. Maybe the executives just are not interested in the gamlbing industry when research revealed that in early April of 2006 SoftBank completed the purchase of 23% of Betfair, an Internet betting exchange then later cashed in its investment in Betfair selling the remaining slice of a stake it acquired seven years ago.", "446": "Following months of whispers about a possible merger of Sprint and T-Mobile and speculation about whether or not such a deal would gain regulatory approval, Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son has confirmed that he's interested in snapping up the big magenta operator.\n\nSon, who also serves as CEO of Japanese carrier SoftBank, revealed in a recent interview that he wants to buy T-Mobile, but that there are some parts of the potential agreement that need to be worked on. \"We would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,\" the exec explained. Son went on to say that he hasn't yet struck a deal with T-Mobile, but that he does want to \"give [it] a shot.\"\n\nA recent rumor claimed that government officials have cast doubt on whether or not they'd approve a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile because they're happy with the current four carrier configuration of the U.S. wireless market. Son doesn't seem to be totally put off by the regulators' skepticism, though, saying that a T-Mo deal would enable him to create a stronger rival to AT&T and Verizon with better technology and better prices.\n\nWhile Sprint and T-Mobile are the number three and four carriers in the U.S. in terms of size, it still seems likely that an agreement between the two operators would face quite a few hurdles on its path to completion. That's especially true given the Uncarrier moves that T-Mobile has made in the past year and the changes that they've caused other operators to make. Despite all of this, it appears that Masayoshi Son isn't quite ready to give up on is effort to take on AT&T and Verizon with Sprint-Mobile.\n\nIf Sprint and T-Mobile do reach a deal, do you think that there's any way that it could reach completion?\n\nVia The Wall Street Journal", "447": "Braxton Carter, the chief financial officer for T-Mobile, has said that it's highly likely his firm will merge with larger US mobile rival Sprint.\n\n\"It is not a question of if, it is a question of when,\" Carter said, Reuters reports. \"To take a third-scale national player that has the scale benefits with the right business model could be very competitively enhancing in the US.\"\n\nCarter said that the merger of the third and fourth biggest US mobile carriers would create a firm that could show significant cost benefits in merging. AT&T's plan to merge with T-Mobile hit a regulatory road block, with Washington saying it would harm competition, but Carter said there were bigger competitive issues than the number of carriers.\n\n\"The government can't have their cake and eat it too. If they think there really needs to be four players in this market on a nationwide basis, they are going to have to put some structural protections to ensure an adequate distribution of spectrum,\" he said.\n\nThe two biggest carriers, AT&T and Verizon, are stockpiling spectrum he said, not because they needed it but to stop potential competitors from being able to use it. That was the key block to an effective market for mobile services, he said.\n\nClearly Carter hasn't been sharing his optimism for a deal with his boss, CEO John Legere. \"Remember when people actually liked @sprint? Yeah, me either. #SprintLikeHell,\" tweeted T-Mobile's pugnacious CEO on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the big bosses at Deutsche Telekom, which owns a majority stake in T-Mobile USA, said at a news conference last week that there was the possibility for a merger between the carrier and a third party, but that it was in no rush. \u00ae\n\nSponsored: Five steps to dealing with the insider threat", "448": "The telecom price war is in full swing with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and AT&T (NYSE:T) cutting plan pricing over the weekend. In the last two months, Sprint (NYSE:S) launched its Framily plan and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) even jumped into the war. For decades this industry has acted like an oligopoly where pricing was similar and contracts kept you locked into a carrier. All that is changing and the rate of change is picking up...leaving you the winner.\n\nAT&T dropped prices over the weekend...\n\nOn March 8, AT&T announced new pricing for customers with one or two lines starting at $65 per month, which is a $15 discount from the current plan for one smartphone with no annual service contract. Customers can also sign up for a free 50 GB allocation of cloud storage. Lastly, new and existing customers will also receive $100 in billing credit for each additional line added on.\n\n...in response to T-Mobile\n\nThis reduction in AT&T's bill comes one day after T-Mobile sweetened the deal on its own monthly plan. Not by reducing the monthly cost but by expanding its services. On March 7, T-Mobile improved its subscription in three ways: 1) it doubled the amount of data on its 4G LTE and tethering plans to 1GB, 2) it began offering free and unlimited international texting and 3) it added more roaming countries.\n\nThis follows an admission that competition is heading up\n\nAt the Morgan Stanley conference last week, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's CEO, said that the competition among carriers dramatically accelerated last year. It began with T-Mobile shifting away from contracts and device subsidies and began offering to pay early termination fees for customers who switch and trade in their devices. This has forced other carriers to offer device financing as well while embracing no contract plans.\n\nEven Verizon is no longer immune\n\nVerizon had kept out of the war throughout 2013 but T-Mobile's aggressiveness picked up in January and couldn't be ignored any longer. Until this point, Verizon had stuck to its claim that its 4G network was unparalleled and warranted a pricing premium. However, T-Mobile offered to pay $650 to compensate customers of AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint who wanted to switch vendors and trade in their phones for a lower-priced plan.\n\nEvidently, Verizon felt pressure because it finally took the plunge in mid-February and lowered prices. Verizon announced a \"More Everything\" plan that adds unlimited international text, video, and picture messaging to its unlimited domestic plans. It also doubled the data allowance and dropped the $3 per month fee for access to 25GB of Verizon's cloud storage. While these features seem to be at the periphery of what drives people to a carrier, features like international picture texting could be a pain point for certain demographics and very profitable for firms like Verizon.\n\nIn summary, your monthly cost is dropping\n\nThe key takeaway from all of these changes is that 1) pricing is coming down and 2) it's going to cut into profits for all of the carriers. They are still offering access to the 25GB of cloud storage, they're just doing it for free, the cost isn't going away. Even though carriers are taking steps to reduce the financial impact by eliminating handset subsidies, its unclear how much of an impact this will have longer term. Its one thing to make an announcement in the press, its another thing for the impact to filter through your installed base.\n\nI'm a good example of this, it took a few weeks for me to realize that we were just handed an opportunity to reduce our monthly bills. Two weeks ago, I called my carrier and cut $40 off of my monthly plan without extending my contract or impacting my level of service. What will happen to profitability when everybody does this?", "449": "The Sprint/T-Mobile merger may seem like it's dead in the water but it would appear at the very least that they are at least keeping the dreams and hopes of the successful acquisition alive for investors. According to a statement made today by T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter, the expectancy of a wireless industry consolidation involving T-mobile is still very much a possibility. Diving further into the matter, he says that if the merger takes place is not really the topic for discussion, but when the merger takes place, implying that the whole deal comes down to a factor of time.\n\nMany people see the rejection of the At&t merger and think the same thing will happen with Sprint, and a strong argument could be made for that case as since then, T-Mobile has made considerable strides forward on its own without a merger of any kind. Still, Carter sees the merger as something that could benefit the U.S. wireless industry from a competition standpoint. The problem with fostering competition in this market is that spectrum auctions are dominated by the two largest carriers in the U.S., Verizon, and At&t. To preserve competition, the government will have to do a better job at regulating the dispersal of Spectrum. Carter's argument is such that the government wants to keep 4 major players within the U.S. wireless industry but that they basically don't do enough to ensure adequate spectrum distribution, stating that, -The government can't have their cake and eat it too. If they think there really needs to be four players in this market on a nationwide basis, they are going to have to put some structural protections to ensure an adequate distribution of spectrum-.\n\nFor now, T-Mobile seems to be doing OK and their parent company Deutsche Telekom stated last week they have no need to rush any sort of plans to consolidate the U.S. market wireless industry but that it is open to the possibility of a deal if the right deal comes along. DT's CEO Tim Hoettges says that -At the moment we have no difficulties to run T-Mobile US on a stand-alone basis-. It seems that more than one party member on either side of this deal are open to the possibility of change and entering into this merger, even if T-Mobile's CEO John Legere seems to feel differently by making the usual joke about his competition via tweet.", "450": "If you are rooting against the proposed Sprint and T-Mobile merger, it could be time to give up the good fight. Though many (the FCC included) would prefer the two stay separate, recent comments made by a T-Mobile executive hint that their joining forces is inevitable. The comments not only attempt to soften opinion on the merger, but suggest it\u2019s going to happen.\n\nAt a recent Internet and telecom conference, T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter said \u201cIt is not a question of if, it is a question of when\u201d in regard to his company merging and consolidating in the future. Though not specifically mentioning Sprint, Carter\u2019s other comment is what really strikes a nerve:\n\nTo take a third-scale national player that has the scale benefits with the right business model could be very competitively enhancing in the U.S.\n\nInteresting commentary, but to whom is he referring? What is the right business model? As Reuters points out, the CFO\u2019s salinet reasoning flies in the face of their wildcard CEO, who bashed Sprint just last week via (you guessed it) Twitter. In a tweet, John Legere poked fun at Sprint\u2019s popularity. Though seemingly jocular in tone, it could be Legere is just jockeying for position in an upcoming merger.\n\nLegere points out most people dislike Sprint. The CFO says a merger is a good idea \u2014 with the right business plan in place. While Sprint parent company Softbank is leading the purchasing charge for T-Mobile, it could be the T-Mobile brand that sticks around, not Sprint. The merger still puts the newly formed company in third place behind AT&T and Verizon, so it\u2019s likely not going to ruffle the same feathers in the FCC.\n\nThough the FCC is historically against a merger, Carter is challenging them to step up. \u201cThe government can\u2019t have their cake and eat it too. If they think there really needs to be four players in this market on a nationwide basis, they are going to have to put some structural protections to ensure an adequate distribution of spectrum.\u201d\n\n", "451": "Three years ago, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse became the public face of opposition to an AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile, arguing that \"the wireless industry would regress toward a 1980s-style duopoly\u201d and the merger \u201cshould be stopped\u201d because \"Sprint believes in competition, which goes hand-in-hand with innovation.\"\n\nHesse\u2019s comments, even when valid, may have been a bit self-serving. Hesse slid between calling the U.S. the \"most competitive wireless market in the world\u201d in 2010 to warning of \u201ctoo much concentration\u201d in 2011 to arguing that \"The industry would be healthier, and competition would be better if there was some consolidation and number three was closer in size to (number) one and two\u201d in 2013. Regardless, Hesse ultimately won the battle when the DOJ threatened to block the AT&T/T-Mobile merger, effectively killing it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat victory came at a price for Sprint. The anti-consolidation positions staked out by the FCC and DOJ in 2011 may now make it difficult for them to approve a \u201c4-to-3\u201d merger. Meanwhile, Dan Hesse\u2019s role as a very public critic of wireless industry consolidation may make him a less-than-ideal face for Softbank-owned Sprint\u2019s desire to acquire T-Mobile.\n\nEnter Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has less anti-merger baggage. Masayoshi Son comes to the U.S. Chamber on Tuesday to speak on \"The Promise of Mobile Internet in Driving American Innovation, the Economy and Education\u201d \u2026 and presumably on how a Sprint/T-Mobile merger can make all of that happen.\n\nMasayoshi Son has a difficult play to make here, given that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said, \u201cThe mobile business is today, with four carriers, a competitive business, and it's important it stay that way.\u201d DISH\u2019s recent acquisition of the H-Block could mean that another wireless network is on the way, though regulators might be unwilling to count their carriers before the networks have hatched, given that the same seemed true of Lightsquared in 2011. Nevertheless, the U.S. wireless market is a widely envied global leader in advanced wireless services precisely because regulators have largely allowed the market to function. It was, for example, the relatively unrestricted 2008 spectrum auction that led to the rapid U.S. development of 4G services.\n\nThat market-based approach is not written it stone, though. Sprint\u2019s play is a potentially dangerous invitation to regulators. As Hesse said in 2011 \"With the elimination of competition, we will ironically return to more government regulation\u2026\u201d\n\nHesse\u2019s words did not fall on deaf ears. As one knowledgeable observer said at the time, a wireless merger would give the FCC \"the opportunity to establish terms and conditions which could become the Wireless Age equivalent to the Kingsbury Commitment\u201d and the Communications Act does not \u201cprohibit the FCC from imposing merger terms and spectrum auction rules that might seem to be regulation in another guise.\u201d Merger conditions, he wrote \"would not only establish rules for Ma Bell, but would then expand from the largest carrier to all others\u201d in a kind of \u201cregulatory contagion.\u201d\n\nThat knowledgeable observer is now the Chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler.\n\nWe may be heading for a complex and colorful fight, something for which Softbank\u2019s Masayoshi Son appears well-suited. Once, when a Japanese competitor was awarded 2.5GHz spectrum that Softbank wanted, Masayoshi Son lodged a complaint, got into a \"50-minute shouting match,\u201d and said, \"I\u2019m fully prepared to die if necessary to say this.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., comments, press releases and ex parte filings rarely lead to death \u2014 though the poor lawyers who have to read all of them may sometimes wish it \u2014 but Softbank and Sprint will have to say a great deal to overcome the concerns expressed in the past by the FCC\u2026 and Sprint itself.\n\nMeanwhile, those of us who are generally skeptical of FCC regulations should worry just how much freedom Sprint might sacrifice for their own short-term benefit, and whether that \u201cregulatory contagion\u201d will end up capturing the entire industry. If the FCC uses this deal as a pretext for imposing new regulatory burdens on wireless, they could, ironically, discourage both new entry and overall investment \u2014 while also failing to focus on the real problem the FCC identified years ago: the need to open up more spectrum.\n\nHenke is strategic director for TechFreedom, a technology policy think tank.", "452": "Sprint confirmed the departures of two high-ranking executives last week, highlighting the carrier's growing woes and need for a new strategy.\n\nSprint president Steven L. Elfman will be stepping down sometime later this year, although an exact timetable was not given. On top of that, 26-year veteran of Sprint and senior vice president in charge of network infrastructure Bob Azzi will also be leaving. Sprint has not given a specific reason for Azzi's departure.\n\n\"Bob and Sprint reached a mutual understanding and Bob will be leaving. He is very actively engaged with the team to ensure a smooth transition of responsibility and we wish him well,\" Roni Singleton, a spokeswoman for Sprint, told Reuters.\n\nThe shakeups come in the wake of Sprint's sale to Japanese-based SoftBank Corp. last year, which has been trying to push Sprint higher than its third-place position in the U.S. wireless market. Recent quality reports indicate that Sprint trails Verizon and AT&T in many areas concerning service and coverage. Eccentric SoftBank chief executive and Sprint chairman Masayoshi Son has been adamant in changing the way Sprint does business, unsatisfied with what he considers a stagnant rate of progress.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Son has repeatedly lost his temper during meetings with Sprint executives, reportedly screaming \"are you stupid?\" during an October meeting concerning Sprint's advertising. He has also bashed Sprint for having a \"loser\" mentality and compared the Kansas-based wireless service provider to Japanese feudal lords who had influence locally, but wielded no power outside of their home turf.\n\n\"Sprint is a daimyo in Kansas,\" said Son. \"That's not enough.\"\n\n\"We need to change Sprint's culture,\" Son told The Wall Street Journal after a news conference in February.\n\nIn order to speed up Sprint's progress, Son has apparently established a proxy headquarters for himself and SoftBank executives. In addition to being more hands on with Sprint, Son is also pushing to make Sprint bigger by acquiring T-Mobile.\n\n\"Without industry consolidation, for Sprint alone to become No. 1 in the U.S. is literally just a dream. I'm not content for Sprint to remain No. 3 because if we could grow bigger, we will offer aggressive discounts and services, just like we did in Japan,\" Son said during the recent Sprint quarterly earnings report.\n\n\"There is a huge gap between the bigger two and the smaller two, thus the level of competition isn't sound or strong.\"\n\nDespite Son's pleas, however, a takeover of T-Mobile looks highly unlikely. U.S. antitrust officials as well as the FCC have expressed concern that further consolidation in the wireless market could hurt consumers. As it is, there are only four major carriers in the United States: Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Even if Sprint and T-Mobile were able to merge, the new company's combined customer base would still be smaller than the second-largest carrier in the United States, AT&T.", "453": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) started the week on a down note today -- falling 55 points in late trading -- after Chinese exports were reported to have fallen 18.1% from a year ago for an overall trade deficit.\n\nIt should be noted that the Lunar New Year holiday fell mostly in February, which will impact production over the first two weeks of the month. So while the decline in exports seems sharp, when adjusted for the holiday it may not be as bad as it first appears.\n\nWireless battle continues\n\nDow wireless companies AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are respectively down 0.25% and 0.5% today after the battle for customers intensified. AT&T announced over the weekend it is cutting the cost of its 2 GB Mobile Share Value data plan by $15, to $65 per month.\n\nBefore you get too excited, this is only for consumers who aren't under contract, meaning you must have a phone that's past its two-year contract or pay full price for the phone. The savings would be $360 over two years, which is about the same as the subsidy AT&T and Verizon give for high-end smartphones.\n\nAT&T is trying to fight off a massive effort by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to steal customers by offering lower prices and no contracts. T-Mobile just increased the 4G LTE data customers get in the base $50 plan from 500 MB to 1 GB and will even pay for new users to sever contracts with rivals.\n\nThus far, the price battle has been between T-Mobile and AT&T, and like the $15 reduction in monthly costs, many of the new offers simply shift when customers are spending money.\n\nVerizon Wireless has largely stayed out of the fray because it commands higher rates thanks to a larger 4G LTE network. But if AT&T and T-Mobile both begin to push lower prices without contracts Verizon may have to shift its strategy from pushing contracts.\n\nFor investors, the reaction today is negative, but it will take time to see how successful T-Mobile is in shaking up the wireless industry. AT&T and Verizon have huge infrastructure advantages that won't be easy to overcome. I wouldn't bet against these giants, even if T-Mobile is rattling the cages of the wireless industry right now.", "454": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is visiting the U.S. this week to tell Washington how the U.S. can learn from Japan\u2019s example to improve its mobile broadband infrastructure.\n\nStill smarting from early indications that U.S. regulators are skeptical of a possible merger of SoftBank\u2019s Sprint subsidiary with Deutsche Telekom\u2019s T-Mobile USA, the real purpose of the trip is to make the case that combining the #3 and #4 U.S. mobile networks would help rather than harm competition in the U.S. market.\n\nSon\u2019s argument in favor of the merger is a curious one, however. He believes the merger is the only way to raise U.S. mobile broadband networks to the level of its counterparts in Europe and Japan.\n\nAt an earnings briefing last month, for example, Son deflected questions about a possible Sprint/T-Mobile deal. \"What I can say is that the United States' mobile industry is not competitive compared with other countries and its network is not good,\" he said.\n\nThose comments continued a theme Son has played before. \u201cEvery time I make a business trip to the U.S., I am reminded how terrible connections are there,\u201d he said at a press conference February. \u201cThe U.S. has one of the world\u2019s highest mobile fees,\u201d and the principles of competition aren\u2019t working, he said.\n\nHow\u2019s that again?\n\nInternational rankings of broadband pricing and performance are notoriously squishy, making their manipulation an irresistible tool for advocates for all manner of government intervention and policy change. Different geographies, population densities, and histories of government investment and ownership in communications infrastructure make apples-to-apples comparisons impossible.\n\nJapan, for example, is a fraction the size of the U.S., with a far more centralized, urban and culturally similar population. There, SoftBank competes primarily with NTT DoCoMo, a former government-operated carrier that is still over a third owned by Japanese taxpayers, its original investor.\n\nStill, even lopsided comparisons suggests that if anything it is Japan that would most benefit from applying the U.S. model of broadband innovation. On every relevant measure of competitiveness, the U.S. Internet ecosystem outstrips that of Japan and Europe. (Even the FCC is forced by overwhelming evidence to agree, as I noted in detail last year. )\n\nFor example, according to the multilateral Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, the U.S. already has a higher penetration of standard mobile broadband subscriptions than Japan, with the U.S. at over 90 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. According to OpenSignal, real-world tests of actual download speeds show that Japan\u2019s latest 4G LTE networks perform the worst.\n\nEven more overwhelming data comes from CTIA, The Wireless Association. A few data points worth noting from CITA\u2019s most recent findings:\n\nU.S. carriers\u2019 investment represents a quarter of the total worldwide spend on mobile infrastructure, averaging six times more per subscriber than global counterparts.\n\nBy the end of 2013, nearly 20% of U.S. connections were on high-speed 4G LTE networks, compared with less than 2% in Europe. The U.S. holds half of the world\u2019s LTE connections despite having only 5% of the total mobile customer base.\n\nData prices per megabyte have fallen 93% in the past five years, while usage has exploded. While the Consumer Price Index increased nearly 17% since 2006, mobile prices overall fell 8%.\n\nFollowing Sprint\u2019s acquisition of Clearwire and T-Mobile\u2019s merger with MetroPCS, the U.S. now has four major mobile broadband providers providing 4G LTE coverage (Japan has only three). There are also dozens of regional providers and virtual networks, including Wal-Mart\u2019s Straight Talk and Boost Mobile, who offer pre-paid plans that operate using the networks of other carriers. Satellite maverick Dish Network may be preparing to enter the market as well.\n\nWhile pro-regulatory U.S. academics torture this data in an effort sing the praises of broadband utopias in the rest of the world, Europeans at least see just the opposite. Neelie Kroes, the EU\u2019s senior communications regulator, has repeatedly bemoaned the failure of interventionist EU policies that have made Europe uncompetitive on every measure with U.S. mobile broadband. \u201cEU companies are not global internet players,\u201d Kroes recently reminded her colleagues.\n\nAccording to Roslyn Layton, a European researcher who has been studying the mythologizing of Europe\u2019s supposed mobile victory, the reality is that \u201cEuropeans roundly complain about the quality of their broadband, and there is no European who would say that the US is falling behind Europe.\u201d\n\nAnd of course it is U.S. companies that dominate the explosive growth of content, services and apps used on mobile networks worldwide. Of the ten largest Internet companies, seven are U.S.-based; only one, Rakuten, is Japanese Of the ten most visited websites in the world, the top six are U.S. firms. None are from Japan.\n\nMoreover, despite the fact that half the world\u2019s Internet users are in Asia, a recent study from The Economist found that Asian companies are hobbled by regulatory and culture obstacles that consistently keep them from competing in the global market. \u201cAsia is not alone in struggling to export home-grown Internet services,\u201d the report noted. \"If anything, Europe has had an even harder time \u2014 despite lesser regulatory, linguistic and cultural hurdles to international expansion.\u201d\n\nI could go on, but I think the point is more than made. However the U.S mobile ecosystem might be improved, the solutions will not be found by importing the inapplicable and largely failed business practices and regulatory policies of other countries.\n\nSimply put, the mobile broadband market in the U.S. is generating, more than in any other country, what my co-author Paul Nunes and I call \u201cBig Bang Disruption,\u201d inspiring enterprises of all sizes to launch innovative new products and services at a remarkable\u2014and accelerating\u2014pace. It is creating value, jobs, and economic activity at perhaps the fastest pace of any new technology since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Real Limits on U.S. Mobile Competition: Less, not More, Regulatory Intervention\n\nWhich is not to say that the U.S market is perfect, or even that a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile might not make good economic sense. Reducing the number of nationwide carriers from four to three could nonetheless create a stronger third carrier, putting even more effective competitive pressure on Verizon and AT&T than the two smaller carriers can apply on their own.\n\nIf SoftBank is to make that case, however, Son will need to drop his disingenuous and unconvincing U.S. bashing, and take a closer look at the real reasons Sprint and T-Mobile lag so far behind their competitors.\n\nThough the carriers have different histories, both Sprint and T-Mobile are struggling with the legacy of a series of strategic blunders by current and former owners. Both companies, for example, sat out the last major spectrum auction for bandwidth below 1 GHz, and now complain that their ability to build out LTE networks beyond their urban strongholds are constrained by that decision.\n\nMore to the point, both companies have badly under-invested in network upgrades over the last several years. According to data compiled by the FCC in its 2013 Mobile Competition Report, both carriers lag dangerously behind in capital expenditures on their respective networks.\n\nSource: Federal Communications Commission\n\nFor Sprint, what Son himself refers to as the company's \"loser\" culture is the legacy of a long history of mismanagement and lack of focus, which allowed SoftBank to acquire the carrier in 2013 for a bargain basement price. (SoftBank outbid Dish, which saw Sprint as an easy way into the market.) SoftBank promised regulators it would make major investments in Sprint\u2019s outdated technology, for which its consumers and other proponents of enhanced competition should be grateful.\n\nT-Mobile USA, on the other hand, has been hamstrung by the on-again, off-again, on-again attention of its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, the former national phone company which is still owned in significant part by the German government. By 2011, DT had dramatically cut its investment in the U.S. subsidiary. But after failing to convince U.S. regulators to allow it to sell T-Mobile to AT&T, DT has shown renewed interest, spending at least some of the $3 billion breakup fee it received on innovative marketing\u2014if not network upgrades.\n\nDT\u2019s long-term commitment to T-Mobile, however, is still very much in doubt. It is entirely possible that renewed interest in T-Mobile USA is simply an effort to gussy up the company to improve the purchase price it can negotiate in the near-future with SoftBank. That, in any case, is what SoftBank\u2019s Son believes, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAside from poor management at some U.S. mobile broadband companies, the real limits on even faster expansion and improvement of mobile services in the U.S., ironically, are not competitive, but rather regulatory. It's not more government interference that's needed, in other words, but less.\n\nToday, the two limiting factors on how quickly all mobile broadband carriers can deploy even faster technology are a lack of available radio spectrum and approvals for cell tower and antenna siting, both under the control of slow-moving regulators.\n\nIn the teeth of FCC rules requiring state and local authorities to decide quickly on permit requests for new equipment, proceedings to build new towers or even to replace existing antenna already on utility poles continue to drag on.\n\nEven in Northern California, the home of leading technology companies, my local community just north of Berkeley has been dithering for more than a year over permit applications by AT&T to place six new antennae on existing utility poles.\n\nAt nearly a dozen meetings of a local advisory council, the county planning commission and recently, the county board of supervisors, well-organized outside agitators delay the inevitable by repeating unscientific claims regarding the health risk of radio waves\u2014a factor they know perfectly well is the exclusive domain of federal authorities to consider in any case.\n\nAnd despite repeated calls from both the White House and Congress to free up more frequencies for mobile consumers before a \u201cspectrum crisis\u201d causes irreparable damage, the FCC and the Department of Commerce continue to proceed at a glacial pace to clear and redeploy unused or underutilized bands from both private and public license holders\u2014notably over-the-air television broadcasters and the Department of Defense.\n\nEven when spectrum is auctioned, the FCC's efforts to improve the competitive position of the lagging carriers inevitably backfire.\n\nLast month, for example, the FCC concluded its first significant spectrum auction since 2008, licensing some of the last bits of unassigned frequencies in its inventory, known as the H Block. Though both Sprint and T-Mobile had expressed enthusiastic interest in the H Block, in the end neither company bothered to participate in the auction.\n\nSprint\u2019s decision not to bid was especially surprising. After demanding\u2014and winning\u2014numerous concessions from the FCC on both the design and structure of the H Block auction, Sprint abruptly pulled out at the last minute, leaving Dish Network as the sole nationwide bidder.\n\nRealizing the worst fears of FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, the H Block auction became not an auction but rather a retail sale, with Dish winning all 176 local lots for the minimum bid price of just over $1.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the two carriers are both pressuring the FCC to give them even more advantages in the delayed incentive auctions for reclaimed broadcast spectrum, threatening to undermine the incentives needed to get broadcasters to participate in the first place.\n\nWhile both Sprint and T-Mobile's foreign owners pay lip-service to the value of competitive markets, both seem content to rely in reality on intended and unintended government largesse, just as they do in their home countries.\n\nIf that\u2019s the kind of game-playing SoftBank has planned in its future efforts to sell Washington on the competitive imperative to acquire T-Mobile, CEO Masayoshi Son may as well stay home. The results speak for themselves.\n\nFollow my on Facebook and Twitter.

Since then, federal regulators have basically told SoftBank to put its ardor on ice because there is already too little competition in the wireless market. But SoftBank may have a trick up its sleeve, coming at the deal through the lens of a market that is even less competitive \u2014 broadband.\n\nBloomberg reports that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son will be in Washington, D.C., this week to put his revised sales pitch before regulators at the FCC and the Justice Dept.\n\nSon had previously tried to woo regulators by reportedly claiming that the only way for Sprint and T-Mobile to compete with the much larger AT&T and Verizon is for the two smaller businesses to merge.\n\nThe new tactic is to convince folks in D.C. that a combined Sprint/T-Mobile could provide a viable competitive alternative to broadband services.\n\nAs we recently highlighted, many cities across America have little to no competition for residential broadband service. Even those cities where there are multiple companies involved, there is sometimes no overlap.\n\n\u201cIn most markets you have one or two choices for broadband. SoftBank\u2019s strategy is to convince the FCC and DOJ that a strengthened No. 3 player can compete with cable,\u201d a Wells Fargo analyst explains to Bloomberg. \u201cThe key to this will be finding a way to make it politically palatable so it doesn\u2019t look like regulators are doing an about-face on the four-player market preference.\u201d\n\nThere are those who believe that the future of broadband is not fiber-to-the home but some form of wireless data delivery that can provide data speeds most customers need for Internet use and streaming video/music/games without the hassle of creating a wired network that connects to each end user.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that such service will someday be commonplace, but the question is whether it will be the cable companies, the wireless providers, or some third party like Google, that will be the ones to make it a reality.\n\nGiven Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s comparatively sluggish rollout of LTE, we have a hard time believing that SoftBank will be able to convince regulators that these are the two companies that will successfully compete against the Comcasts of the world.", "456": "Note: By submitting this form, you agree to Third Door Media's terms .

It\u2019s an update of the 1980 13-episode series featuring Carl Sagan. Like the original, it\u2019s designed to make big scientific concepts interesting and accessible to ordinary people. Here are some of my random impressions:\n\nI can\u2019t speak to his accomplishments as an astronomer, but as the public face of cosmology, Neil deGrasse Tyson is a worthy successor to his mentor, the great Carl Sagan, who died in 1996.\n\nSagan\u2019s fingerprints were all over the show, including his beautiful statement \u201cwe are made of starstuff.\u201d Tyson\u2019s story about meeting him when Tyson was 17 illustrated how Sagan wasn\u2019t just a good scientist, he was a good person.\n\nThe original series ran on PBS. This is on Fox and will be repeated on Mondays on National Geographic. I didn\u2019t pick up any of Fox News\u2019 anti-science bias and the producers say the network has been easy to work with.\n\nThe visual effects were amazing and beautiful. But I found the \u201cspaceship of the imagination\u201d to be a distraction and would have preferred it to remain imaginary.\n\nThe zooming out of \u201caddress lines\u201d from planet to solar system to galaxy to local group to universe to multiverse really drove home how unimaginably large the cosmos is, and how small we are. I already knew this, but seeing it made it much more real.\n\nSo was the \u201ccosmic year\u201d illustrating just how old the universe is and just how recently humans came into existence.\n\nWhile I\u2019m happy they talked about Giordano Bruno, I don\u2019t think giving him a whole segment was a good use of air time. Bruno was a martyr for religious tolerance and possibly for pantheism \u2013 he was not a scientist and was not a martyr for science.\n\nCalling Venus (average temperature over 800\u00b0 F) \u201ca kind of hell\u201d was a poor choice of words.\n\nNone of my complaints will matter one bit if people \u2013 especially kids \u2013 actually watch the show. American scientific literacy and respect for the results of the scientific method is abysmal. Simply presenting information in an intellectual context isn\u2019t enough \u2013 we need a compelling story. Cosmos may be the story we need.\n\nAs a Pagan who seeks to form and strengthen a reverent relationship with Nature, I love science. Science is how we learn the facts of Nature. Science is how we test and refine our theories \u2013 and how sometimes, we throw them out because the evidence contradicts them. Science \u2013 and its mathematical cousin, statistics \u2013 is how we learn to separate cause from correlation from coincidence.\n\nFor all my love of mysticism, spirituality, and the Otherworld, the vast majority of my life is spent here, in this world. I want to know as much about this world \u2013 about the cosmos \u2013 as I can. I respect the findings of science, and it disturbs me that far too many people use their religion as an excuse to discount scientific discoveries they find uncomfortable.\n\nAs I was watching the show, I heard the voice of my naturalistic friends in the back of my head. They said \u201cthe universe is so vast and so old you only think you can comprehend it. It is beautiful and terrible, creative and destructive, and we who are so tiny and weak and brief are a part of it all. Why do you need anything more?\u201d\n\nI need more because I\u2019ve experienced more. I\u2019ve experienced the Gods, ancestors and spirits. I\u2019ve experienced magic. I\u2019ve experienced Unity. I can\u2019t ignore those experiences or rationalize them away and I don\u2019t want to.\n\nOne of the concepts that really drove home the size of the Universe is the cosmic event horizon. As Neil deGrasse Tyson explained, there are parts of the Universe we can\u2019t observe (not with instruments and certainly not with our eyes) because they\u2019re so far away light from them hasn\u2019t reached Earth yet \u2013 even though the Universe is 13.8 billion years old.\n\nThink about that for a minute. If we had a telescope with infinite magnification, we could focus it on the edge of our solar system, or the edge of our galaxy, or on some galaxy far far away. We could keep focusing on objects farther and farther out, but eventually all would go black \u2013 not because there was a boundary or because there was nothing there, but because light from those objects hadn\u2019t had time to reach us yet.\n\nThere are very real objects that science can\u2019t observe or measure.\n\nLikewise, there are very real things in our lives that science can\u2019t observe or measure. Science can tell us what we are, but it can\u2019t tell us who we are. Science can explain what happens to our brain chemistry when we fall in love, but it can\u2019t explain the experience of being in love. Science can tell us how we live, but it can\u2019t tell us how we should live or what our lives mean.\n\nScience is a wonderful servant, but it is a soulless master.\n\nThe cosmos is amazing and it fills me with wonder and awe. The new Cosmos is beautiful and fascinating and I hope the whole country watches it. We need a greater appreciation for science and a greater respect for the findings of science.\n\nBut I remain a polytheist and a pantheist, a Druid and a priest.", "475": "AUSTIN \u2014 When acclaimed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took to Twitter last fall to catalogue the scientific errors in Gravity \u2014 \"Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west\" \u2014 he had not intended his factual critique to go viral. Not even close.\n\n\"I was astonished at the attention the tweets got,\" he told BuzzFeed while at the SXSW Film Festival, where the first episode of his scientific TV series COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey screened before its series premiere on Fox. \"I have some metrics for how far a tweet will reach. I had no way to have predicted it [would be] on Today, and \"Weekend Update\" [on] Saturday Night Live, and on CBS Morning Show, and the blogosphere.\"\n\nTyson's shock was partly due to the fact that this was far from the first time he's critiqued science in a film. He famously got James Cameron to replace the night sky in the 2012 re-release of Titanic, and he once schooled Jon Stewart on the rotation of the globe that opens The Daily Show. (And then there was the time Tyson, as the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, was the most visible scientist in the successful effort to de-list Pluto as a planet, a different sort of fact-check.) Tyson explained, however, that he only tries to weigh in on a movie's accuracy \"if the film has a premise that it's getting things right.\" \"I don't tell you the bad physics in Star Wars,\" he noted.\n\nThe Gravity tweets, however, garnered so much attention so quickly \u2014 even after Tyson clarified that he did enjoy the film \"very much\" \u2014 that it's given the Harvard and Columbia educated scientist pause about the whole notion of pop-culture fact checking.\n\n\"I don't know if I'll do it again, given how people just went crazy,\" he said. He happily listed the science that Gravity got right, including the appearance of liquid water in space, the orientation of the stars in space, and the physics to how Sandra Bullock tumbled backward when she first tried to use the fire extinguisher. \"But that's not as interesting as picking out the few things that it got wrong,\" he asserted.\n\nThen again, it's doubtful Tyson will keep to that mild declaration. When pressed to list films that did indeed get the science right, something compels Tyson \u2014 perhaps his sense of scientific rigor, his sense of showmanship, or both \u2014 to note when those films also got something wrong, even when it is Tyson's stated favorite film ever.", "476": "'Cosmos' Accused of Taking a Jab at Catholics\n\nEmail Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin\n\nSome are crying foul at the opening episode of the much-anticipated reboot of the Carl Sagan science program \"Cosmos.\"\n\nHosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sunday's debut episode featured an animated segment on the persecution of Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century monk and astronomer.\n\nBruno claimed that neither the earth nor the sun was the center of the universe, reportedly prompting his arrest and execution as demanded by the Roman Catholic Church. It is a scene that some, including media researcher Matt Philbin, have decried as unfairly attacking the Catholic Church.\n\nManaging editor of the Culture and Media Institute of the conservative group the Media Research Center, Philbin told The Christian Post that \"Cosmos\" \"absolutely\" was taking a jab at the Church.\n\n\"They skipped Copernicus and Galileo -- two far more consequential men in proving and disseminating the heliocentric theory -- because in their cases, the Church's role was much more complicated,\" said Philbin.\n\n\"An honest telling of either story would open the door to a discussion of what else the Church had done over the years to preserve and foster scientific inquiry. That would never lend itself to a simple story of cartoon(ish) clerics stamping on knowledge and burning books.\"\n\nPhilbin also told CP that he believed the Bruno story was told because \"it's a Manichean good vs. them tale.\"\n\n\"They then dumb it down to remove all Bruno's weird theological ideas, and leave us with a Bruno who's little more a hapless hippie burned at the stake for having a psychedelic dream,\" said Philbin.\n\n\"I understand the reverence a lot of people have for Carl Sagan's original, but space ships and cartoons are the stuff of Saturday morning TV, and with the host's obvious condescension toward Christians, the whole thing was dumbed down to the point of being unwatchable.\"\n\nA reboot of the popular Sagan series from the 1980s, \"Cosmos\" aired its introductory episode on Sunday. The documentary series explores the attributes of space and the laws of nature.\n\nThe debut episode garnered controversy for its focus on the Bruno story, with James Poniewozik of Time magazine stating that the series \"steps into the culture war.\"\n\n\"The message is plain: there is a right side and a wrong side of intellectual history, and Cosmos is not afraid to say that science is on the right one,\" wrote Poniewozik.\n\nJennifer Bardi, editor-in-chief of The Humanist and senior editor of TheHumanist.com, told The Christian Post that the story was necessary in showcasing \"individuals who took great risks in formulating and sharing groundbreaking ideas.\"\n\n\"Bruno was instrumental in inspiring other scientists to increase our knowledge of the universe and its vastness. Yes, the Catholic Church punished him for his ideas. How is it unfair to portray this piece of history?\" said Bardi.\n\n\"It's also worth noting that the show doesn't shy away from Bruno's exaltation of God as the limitless creator of the vast universe.\"\n\nRegarding the series itself, Bardi told CP that \"popularizing science is a noble endeavor\" and it is \"gratifying to see the show given such a grand stage.\"\n\n\"Both Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are examples of scientists whose humanity and likeability make them great ambassadors for the adventure that is scientific discovery,\" said Bardi.\n\n\"They're also both near and dear to humanists-the American Humanist Association honored Sagan with the Humanist of the Year in 1981 and Neil deGrasse Tyson received the Isaac Asimov Science Award in 2009.\"\n\nThe Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights issued a statement denouncing the series, declaring that it \"smears Catholicism.\"\n\n\"As for Bruno, he was a renegade monk who dabbled in astronomy; he was not a scientist. There is much dispute about what really happened to him,\" stated the League which cited sources disputing \"Cosmos'\" retelling of Bruno's life.\n\n\"In short, MacFarlane, who is no stranger to the Catholic League, has once again shown his true colors.\"", "477": "Neil deGrasse Tyson spent the majority of his record tenth appearance on The Colbert Report last night promoting his new Fox series Cosmos.

Surely a major component is that we cannot explore our place is the universe without imagination. Yes, science provides data which only fools and dogmatists ignore to their shame. But to turn data into a worldview, we need imagination (a dramatic music and CGI now also assist).\n\nThe mixed message is one that we should embrace \u2013 but not uncritically.

It had been nearly 35 years since Carl Sagan inspired a generation of scientists with 1980's 13-part series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. Immediately, one thing became clear: This is not your parents' Cosmos.\n\nThe ideas and driving principles behind it are the same, but along with its new host, Cosmos has new urgency, and a new edge. Sagan's Cosmos was awash with dream-like wonder, as personal as its title implied, colored by Sagan's agnosticism. Tyson's is different: informed by a generation of additional understanding and discovery \u2013 and special effects too, it's faster, brighter, and more explosive \u2013 and more daring in its evangelism for science.\n\nSagan's approach to science education was personal, almost intimately so. In contrast, Tyson has mastered the art of communicating his passion for ideas without exposing much about the man behind them. Tyson has gone to great lengths to avoid identifying with any specific ideological groups \u2014 he's famous for saying that the only \"-ist\" he identifies as is \"scientist\" \u2014 and he's long argued that science itself is fundamentally apolitical.\n\nThere comes a point, however, where the choice to present the universe through an evidence-based lens is itself a political act.\n\nWe live in an era where the very concept of truth is politicized; where policy-makers and voters and journalists stand in denial of demonstrable science in favor of magical thinking and faith; where science warped by dogma is given equal footing in classrooms and Congress; where \"teaching the controversy\" forces educators to lend false weight to bad science in the name of religion and tradition. And that has cost science the luxury of neutrality. In choosing to argue actively for science, without apologies or appeasement, Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey has thrown down a gauntlet.\n\nBut it might not be the gauntlet you expect.\n\nMost of the controversy and criticism that's arisen around the first episode of A Space-Time Odyssey surrounds the choice of 16th-century philosopher Giordano Bruno as the first historical figure for the show to highlight. Bruno was a philosopher, not a hard scientist, and as Tyson points out, his theory of a heliocentric solar system and infinite cosmos was a lucky guess rather than the result of concrete evidence or research.\n\n. Image courtesy of Fox\n\nThe value in Bruno's tale \u2014 and its relevance to Cosmos \u2014 lies in what it says about science in a social and cultural context. In a recent interview with Space.com, Tyson emphasized that the show's historical profiles exist not only to highlight the discoveries of scientists, but also \"what comes when those [discoveries] encountered the social, political, cultural and religious mores of the day.\"\n\nBruno's story, then, is less about a specific scientific discovery than the curiosity \u2014 and willingness to challenge the reigning philosophy of the time \u2014 that enables science. It's about the moral and human imperative to discovery, even in the face of opposition, and testament to the power of imagination as a catalyst for exploration. That Bruno's view of the cosmos happened to be correct is incidental: what matters is that there, as elsewhere in his heretical philosophy, he dared to question rather than bow mindlessly to tradition.\n\nIt would have been easy to frame the segment as anti-religious, and it's certainly been decried as such by some religious blogs, but that criticism is short-sighted \u2014 and it misses a larger point.\n\nGiordano Bruno saw his cosmology as an expression of his faith, inextricable from his belief in the scope and grandeur of God; that's a fact that Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey revisits again and again. But the conflict between Bruno and his oppressors isn't one of science versus faith. Faith was not an end in itself for Bruno \u2014 it was a doorway to further understanding and enlightenment.\n\nThat ability to challenge and question lies at the heart of science, and at the heart of Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. \"Science, as it is communicated to the public typically, is through the lens of discovery, but in fact, science is a process,\" Tyson told an audience last July. \"Science is what you do in the lab. Science is the wiring of your brain and how you look at the world because of that wiring. It's not the result. It's not just an answer. It is a process. And you need to learn to love the questions themselves. And when you do, the universe is yours.\"\n\nThat, ultimately, is the stand Cosmos has taken, and the line it has drawn: to take an active role in becoming what Carl Sagan described to us 35 years ago as \"a way for the cosmos to know itself.\"\n\nThe second episode of Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey airs this Sunday night at 9 pm EST/PST on Fox and other affiliated networks (FX, FXX, Nat Geo, and others).", "481": "So what\u2019s going on? The original Cosmos, written by and starring the inimitable Carl Sagan, kicked off a decade-long \u201cpopular science boom,\u201d according to Bruce Lewenstein, a professor of science communication at Cornell. By 1993, more than 500 million people in 60 countries had seen the television show. \u201cWhen I ask scientists between the ages of 30 and 60 to name something that made them want to be scientists,\u201d Lewenstein says, \u201ca huge number cite Cosmos.\u201d Beyond raw numbers of viewers and anecdotal reports of personal inspiration, however, we lack data on how Cosmos actually affected public support for science.\n\nPutting aside the question of the original Cosmos\u2019s effects on public opinion, Tyson\u2019s Cosmos is being broadcast to a different world than Sagan\u2019s. Today\u2019s television audiences are famously fragmented; the show came in third-place in the ratings Sunday night, despite being aired simultaneously on 10 Fox family networks. The bigger problem, though, may have to do with changing ideas about what science is for.\n\nSagan\u2019s Cosmos first aired on PBS in 1980, a moment when Cold War tensions were heating back up. This is critical, because so much of postwar funding for American scientific research depended on an implicit bargain with the military-industrial complex. The federal government supported research in science and technology, and, in exchange, scientists offered their expertise should it be needed in times of war. Public support for science was an easy sell, in part, because so much of the Cold War rivalry depended on high-tech weaponry built on cutting-edge science.\n\nSagan was well aware of this relationship and spent much of the 1980s working through its contradictions. On the one hand, Sagan championed public funding for planetary and space exploration, knowing that political support for the space program had traditionally depended on a competition with the Soviet Union. On the other, Sagan criticized President Reagan\u2019s plans for the Strategic Defense Initiative (better known as \u201cStar Wars\u201d), a pie-in-the-sky space weapons program backed by physicist Edward Teller and a bevy of defense contractors but derided by most scientists. Sagan was also an outspoken proponent of the concept of nuclear winter, an idea that helped turn American opinion against the nuclear arms race.\n\nSagan, in other words, was no fan of the military-industrial complex, but he understood that expensive research in fields like astrophysics had historically been supported by the government for reasons that fell short of idealism. And Sagan\u2019s willingness to publicly disagree with other scientists was an acknowledgement that scientists have political opinions as well as technical expertise.\n\nTyson, meanwhile, sometimes presents a more idealized version of science and scientists. In a recent interview with Parade, Tyson remembered his reaction when he witnessing the hijacked planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers on 9/11:\n\nWhat I know is, when you have a cosmic perspective, when you know how large the universe is and how small we are within it\u2014what Earth looks like from space, how tiny it is in a cosmic void\u2014it\u2019s impossible for you to say, \u2018I so don\u2019t like how you think that I\u2019m going to kill you for it.\u2019 You will never find scientists leading armies into battle. You just won\u2019t. Especially not astrophysicists\u2014we see the biggest picture there is\u2026We understand there are bigger problems we need to solve as a species than what God you pray to.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful sentiment, this idea that exposure to the wonders of science will allow people to transcend social, political, and cultural differences. But it\u2019s also obviously wrong, given how much 20th-century warfare depended directly on the products of science. (Historian of technology Patrick McCray has compiled a helpful list of some of the ways that scientists have, in fact, \u201cled armies into battle.\u201d) And Tyson himself probably doesn't truly believe that the relationship between the military and science is so simple. (He's said he's writing a book that will, in part, examine the topic.)", "482": "Neil deGrasse Tyson has been called many things. Groundbreaking astronomer. Dynamic communicator. Sexiest astrophysicist alive.\n\nBut what about public theologian?\n\nIt might sound crazy, but the recent reboot of the television show Cosmos: A Personal Journey \u2014 Carl Sagan\u2019s classic 1980s exploration of all things science, this time starring the charismatic Tyson and renamed \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d \u2014 is already attracting more attention for what it says about religion than astrophysics.\n\nThe show, which premiered Sunday night, begins roughly as expected, with Tyson guiding viewers through a humbling and special-effect laden tour of our seemingly infinite cosmos. But things abruptly shift gears as the program enters its middle segment, with Tyson narrating an animated retelling of the life of Giordano Bruno, a 14th century Dominican friar who dared to make the bold claim that our universe is not confined to the solar system (with the sun at the center), but in fact home an infinite number of suns besides our own, each surrounded by worlds populated with intelligent beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPredictably, Bruno\u2019s ideas weren\u2019t exactly popular with the religious leadership of his day. Scene after scene shows him mocked and exiled for his passionate embrace of an infinite universe, and Bruno is eventually imprisoned and tortured by the religious \u201cthought police.\u201d Ultimately, despite Bruno\u2019s repeated assertion that his controversial conviction is fueled by his deep love in \u201cthe Creator,\u201d we see him burned at the stake for his beliefs.\n\nBruno\u2019s story makes for fantastic drama, but one can\u2019t help but feel that his narrative seems a little out of place in Cosmos. Throughout the program\u2019s hour-long runtime, Tyson repeatedly champions the merits of science and the scientific method; science is powerful, Tyson argues, because it operates using empirically verifiable evidence. Yet Bruno\u2019s belief in an infinite universe was born not out of the evidence or scientific fact, but out of a fantastical vision. Tyson even says as much at the close of the segment: \u201cBruno was no scientist. His vision of the cosmos was a lucky guess, because he had no evidence to support it. Like most guesses, it could well turn out wrong. But once the idea was in the air, it gave others a target to aim at, if only to disprove it.\u201d\n\nSo why tell Bruno\u2019s story? Some have interpreted the segment as an excuse to make a wholesale attack on religion. Spurred by an explosion of people who use religion deny the existence of climate change, the public wing of the scientific community has been more aggressive towards religion recently, with Bill Nye even going so far as to debate the merits of Creationism with Ken Ham at the Creation Museum in Kentucky. Thus, maybe Cosmos, produced by vocal atheist Seth MacFarlane, is using the drama of Bruno\u2019s story to implicitly shame religious Americans by highlighting an example of oppression enacted by religious hierarchy.\n\nBut a closer look at the segment reveals that Tyson and company may have in fact divised a far more effective way of disarming the science-v.-religion debate by venturing into what religious scholars sometimes classify as \u201cpublic theology.\u201d Others have rightly noted that the core message of the Bruno narrative isn\u2019t that God doesn\u2019t exist, but rather \u201cyour God is too small.\u201d The \u201cyour\u201d here is directed not at believers at large, but instead implicitly pointed at the small minority of conservative Christians who continue to doggedly insist that science is somehow incompatible with religion.\n\nAnd make no mistake, they are a minority. Although it receives less airtime than fundamentalist theological strains, scientifically-informed theology is norm \u2014 not the exception \u2014 among modern American Christians. For every conservative pundit or elected official who tries to use the Bible to deny climate change, polls show that there are millions more religious Americans (read: the majority of almost every faith major faith tradition) who agree that the recent string of natural disasters were the result of climate change. In fact, a recent study conducted by Rice University found that not only do roughly half of American evangelicals believe that \u201cscience and religion can work together and support one another,\u201d but that evangelical scientists actually practice their religion more than evangelical Protestants in the general population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoman Catholicism has come a long way since Bruno\u2019s day as well. Although admittedly embarrassingly late to the science game, the Vatican issued a formal apology to Galileo, who was also imprisoned for his scientific beliefs, in 1992, and now employs an official Vatican astronomer. There is even an entire book published by the Vatican dedicated to the discerning the theological challenges of life on other worlds (which is also the subject of some fantastic science fiction), and multiple popes have listed climate change as a primary concern for the church. And lest we forget, the Big Bang Theory was originally developed by none other than Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian physicist, astronomer, and Catholic priest.\n\nTyson himself has made a point of praising this more nuanced brand of religious thought. In a recent interview on WNYC\u2019s \u201cBrian Lehrer Show,\u201d he spoke about the Bruno segment and noted that the real problem isn\u2019t religion per se, but the use of narrow theology to restrict the new ideas.\n\n\u201cThe issue there is not religion versus non-religion, or religion versus science,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cThe issue is ideas that are different versus dogma.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Tyson \u2014 who like Carl Sagan before him, describes himself as an agnostic, although not an atheist \u2014 isn\u2019t likely to be writing theological tomes anytime soon. But perhaps Tyson\u2019s Cosmos can continue to use stories like Bruno\u2019s to assert a simple theological truth that millions of Christians have known for centuries: science might be a threat to intolerant religious people, but God and science are anything but incompatible. At its best, firm theological conviction like Bruno\u2019s can actually work with science to produce fantastic, world-changing ideas \u2014 some of which might even be worth retelling in television shows hundreds of years down the line.\n\nAmen to that.", "483": "On Sunday night I was captivated by Fox's reboot of \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\" a daring visual journey that explores our universe.\n\nOn Monday morning, I was annoyed by my social media timelines, which as usual, turned a harmless television program into a tired \"conservative Christian\" vs \"progressive liberal\" debate.\n\nThis is why we can't have nice things.\n\nI even received personal messages from religious friends who were baffled as to why a Bible believer like myself would be interested in a program that delves into the science behind the birth of the universe.\n\nMy answer: Why wouldn't I?\n\nI don't understand the need to draw battle lines between science and religion. In fact, the more I learn about science, the more in awe I am of God's work.\n\nIt strengthens my faith. It doesn't weaken it.\n\nEver since Eve had that snack in the Garden of Eden, humans have craved knowledge. We want to know more about the world around us.\n\nThat's certainly been the case for me.\n\nI'm the son of a librarian. My mom loaded me down with astronomy books during my formative years. The more I learned, the more fascinated I became with the cosmos. At one point I could name nearly all of Jupiter's umpteen moons and prattle off the names of galaxies near and far. I could spot constellations in the backyard without a telescope and I often bored my aunts and uncles with Greek and Roman celestial nomenclature. From black holes to black dwarfs, I was obsessed with it all.\n\nThat obsession then bled into my spiritual life. I wanted to know more about the God that counts the stars and calls them by name, as Psalms 147: 4 says.\n\nI could never comprehend the mindset of some in the religious community that the study of the stars tramples over scripture. If anything, it reinforces it.\n\nFor instance, Cosmos host Neil deGrasse Tyson spent a great deal of time discussing the \"cosmic calendar\" - which condensed the immensity of time down to a calendar year. The goal was to show just how long it took for our planet to take shape.\n\nAccording to the calendar, one day equals 40 million years. If the \"Big Bang\" happened 13.8 billion years ago on January 1, life on Earth didn't begin until December 31, with civilization rising the last 14 seconds of the year.\n\nI've heard this theory debunked by theologians, who says it contradicts the Bible's creation story, in which God created the world in less than a week. But how arrogant must we be to think that God's week is the same amount of time as a human week? For a being who has existed throughout all of time, seven human days would fly by in the blink of an eye.\n\nCombining science with scriptures just shows how magnificent God's power really is. It made me look to the heavens more and dig into the Bible more deeply.\n\nProverbs 1:7 said it best: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\n\nLearning about our world isn't a threat to scriptures, and nor should a program that encourages learning devolve into pointless political propaganda. Whether you stand with science or scriptures, it's painfully obvious to see how minuscule those liberal and conservative labels are in the grand scheme of our vast universe.\n\nWhy bicker when you can keep learning and keep praying for answers?\n\nEdward T.

Yet, here is the network home of \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d touting \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\u201d its remake of the most definitive science TV series ever, Carl Sagan\u2018s 1980 \u201cCosmos, A Personal Journey\u201d on PBS.\n\nThe series is actually executive produced by Seth MacFarlane of \u201cFamily Guy\u201d fame, in partnership with Ann Druyan, Mr. Sagan\u2019s widow and a co-writer of the original \u201cCosmos\u201d series. \u201cCosmos,\u201d the sequel, will also air on National Geographic, beginning Monday. But the real question is: Can this concept, originally headlined by science\u2019s first rock star in a largely pre-cable universe (only 23 percent of homes even had cable back then) make a dent in today\u2019s media universe, where as Sagan might say, there are \u201cbillions and billions\u201d of options?\n\nSome early returns are in: 8.5 million viewers across 10 channels tuned in for the debut, according to the Wrap. Fox is projecting that more than 40 million viewers worldwide will have seen the debut of the new series by week\u2019s end.\n\nThe series debuted with a few things in its favor. Let\u2019s see. The president of the United States, Barack Obama, stepped in to give a surprise introduction when the series debuted Sunday. And the unprecedented, multiplatform blitz strategy helped spread the word. In addition to re-airing on Nat Geo, the show launched on Fox and 10 sister cable channels simultaneously.\n\nWhile some might think the very notion of TV is too retro in a world going increasingly mobile, this kind of extravagant, special-effects-heavy programming needs to be seen on the big home screen, says Fordham University professor Paul Levinson, author of \u201cNew New Media.\u201d\n\n\u201cTelevision is the ideal place for a relaunch of the Sagan \u2018Cosmos\u2019 series,\u201d he says via e-mail, because it\u2019s the biggest screen in the home and is easily seen by the family or friends at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Cosmos,\u2019 as a subject, requires a screen bigger than the phone, tablet, or laptop, and its profundity makes it a perfect subject for group viewing and discussion, which can take place any time of night or day thanks to DVRs,\u201d he notes. As we go about our busy lives down here on Earth, he adds, \u201cit is more important than ever that we get a sense of the larger universe in which we are situated, and how that relates to our past and our future.\u201d\n\nThe scientific community has welcomed the show, praising host Neil deGrasse Tyson. \u201cThe new \u2018Cosmos\u2019 show is great,\u201d writes Villanova University astronomy professor Edward Guinan from Philadelphia. Mr. Tyson has a great talent for explaining difficult science concepts, such as \u201cdark energy and matter,\u201d in clear and interesting ways, he notes. \u201cHe also has a great sense of humor that will enliven the show.\u201d\n\nAcross campus, Villanova Communication Instructor Derek Arnold notes that the show faces formidable competition. Not just from many other entertainment alternatives, but a vast universe of nature and science programming as well, on everything from the Science Channel to a multitude of Discovery and PBS shows, to name a few.\n\nHowever, he points out that Tyson may be the ideal successor to Sagan. \u201cOne of my sons [who is 15] sees him as his favorite public figure,\u201d he says via e-mail. Tyson can energize viewers with his delivery and also serve as a popular spokesperson for science in general, he says.\n\nJust as Sagan was a pop culture figure, appearing on \u201d \u2018The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,\u2019 so Tyson has made himself a fixture on such late-night destinations as \u201c\u2019The Daily Show,\u2019 \u201d saysRobert Thompson, founder of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture in Syracuse, N.Y.\n\n\u201cHe pointed out to the host Jon Stewart that the turning world in his opening credits was going the wrong direction,\u201d he says with a laugh. He also famously posited a list of scientifically incorrect faux pas committed in the movie, \u201cGravity,\u201d which included the fact that Sandra Bullock\u2019s hair would have been loosely flying, rather than the utterly controlled mane that appeared in the movie.\n\nMore than being well-adapted to the media environment of today, Tyson helps feed a critical science literacy into popular culture, Professor Thompson adds.\n\nSagan\u2019s show tapped into a pop culture obsession with extraterrestrial life, notes Thompson, pointing to such films as \u201cE.T.\u201d and \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d\n\nThe new show introduces heady topics such as string theory and parallel universes, \u201cwhich are real scientific topics, making their way into water-cooler chats.\u201d\n\nThere are very few important geopolitical decisions these days that do not have a science component, he says, \u201cbut we remain a nation that is science and math phobic, so anything that helps feed real science into the public dialogue is a good thing.\u201d\n\nNot all scientists were thrilled with the content, however. John Janovy, professor emeritus of biological sciences at University of Nebraska, Lincoln found it \u201ca little bit shallow and non-engaging.\u201d Mainly, he says via e-mail, \u201cbecause I did not see the essential structure of science, namely a question followed by an attempt to answer it, as part of the narrative.\u201d\n\nAnd what does PBS, the rightful progenitor, make of a mainstream cable broadcast network recreating its most-watched science show ever?\n\n\u201cThe new \u2018Cosmos\u2019 certainly points back to the power and importance of the original,\u201d says Beth Hoppe, PBS chief programming executive. And, she adds, \u201cwe are always happy to see good science content, even if it\u2019s on other channels.\u201d", "486": "Viewers made \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" a true star on Twitter Sunday night.\n\nThe new documentary series, which was introduced by President Barack Obama on 10 networks including Fox and National Geographic, had millions of TV watchers oohing and awwing over the mysterious world of space.\n\n[Related: 'Cosmos' Is Back With A New Host For A New Generation]\n\nMore than 167,000 tweets were sent out during the premiere that explored how old the universe really is and how big Jupiter has become. \"Jupiter is like its own little solar system,\" host Neil deGrease Tyson explained. \"It has more mass than all of the other planets combined.\"\n\nSPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old...

The 13-part remake \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d is hosted by esteemed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nAn introduction by President Barack Obama began the show. He stressed the importance of curiosity and exploration, and paid homage to Sagan while encouraging this new generation of viewers to open their minds to science.\n\n\u201cThe next great discovery could be yours,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFrom the first installment of the series, \u201cStanding Up in the Milky Way,\u201d it\u2019s clear who the target audience is. The show is elementary in its science and storytelling because it\u2019s geared toward younger viewers. However, Tyson\u2019s tone is not condescending; it is about teaching, not lecturing.\n\nStill, the show has a multitude of problems.\n\nSagan\u2019s \u201cCosmos\u201d was lauded for its amazing special affects. Artistically, this first episode was a dud.\n\nIt was too Hollywood-like, starting with its title \u201cA Spacetime Odyssey,\u201d likely an homage to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s classic film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Tyson cruises around the solar system in a spaceship shaped like Boba Fett\u2019s vessel from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. The show unintentionally draws laughs when it depicts Tyson sitting Emperor Palpatine-style, looking out the front window of the ship.\n\nWith Tyson cruising around space, striking the right tone with the special effects is a necessity. \u201cStanding Up in the Milky Way\u201d doesn\u2019t quite get there.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the colors are too vibrant. The show looks too much like the newer \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. It should look more like \u201cGravity,\u201d which didn\u2019t overwhelm with vibrancy, but rather produced a darker outer space that felt more real. Budgetary issues might be to blame for this. The special effects aren\u2019t Syfy channel horrible; they\u2019re just a little off.\n\nLater in the episode, Tyson introduces us to Giordano Bruno, a 16th century Franciscan monk who was burned at the stake for his scientific beliefs. His story is in dull 2D animation. Tyson\u2019s storytelling prose is fine, but the on-screen image is too bland. It\u2019s boring, something a show like this should never be.\n\nWorse than the 2D imagery, Bruno\u2019s story reeks of cheap propaganda. Sagan was also skeptical of religion, but Tyson is much more militaristic on the subject. He even takes a dig at Bruno, pointing out that he was not a man of science but a man of faith, and that his correct vision of the cosmos was a lucky guess. This isn\u2019t the right medium to paint religious people as closed-minded psychos, but that\u2019s what the show does.\n\nThis is a show that should be inclusive, informing the uninformed about the nature of the galaxy. The history of astronomy should be re-visited, but this isn\u2019t an atheist sermon.\n\nBut, for all its faults, the show isn\u2019t a disaster. The purpose of \u201cStanding Up in the Milky Way\u201d is to illustrate just how small humans are. It does this well, as Tyson successfully drives home how young and small the human race is in the grand scheme of things. The outer space special effects aren\u2019t ideal, but the show introduces a virtual cosmic calendar that is perfect.\n\nThough it was a rough maiden voyage for \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\u201d its prestigious host gives the show legitimacy in moving forward. Tyson is a star in the science world, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Born in 1958, he is a byproduct of the \u201cSpace Race\u201d era and was in his twenties when Sagan\u2019s \u201cCosmos\u201d debuted. He\u2019s articulate and smart, but he isn\u2019t boring or condescending. When he\u2019s not depicted ridiculously like a \u201cStar Wars\u201d character, he fits in nicely on screen, much like Sagan. And by the end of the episode, he has laid out the right message.\n\n\u201cFollow the evidence wherever it leads,\u201d Tyson said, \u201cand question everything.\u201d", "488": "Frankly, science literacy is probably the last term anyone would use to describe Fox\u2019s primetime programming.

Highly anticipated, this new effort seeks to reboot, rekindle, and revitalize the indelible impression that its predecessor, hosted by Carl Sagan, made on many of us back in 1980.\n\nThe first episode of the new COSMOS did not disappoint. Will it be the equal of its predecessor? Hard to say after just one episode - but nothing I saw leads me to think that it will be anything but spectacular and on a par with Sagan's pioneering work.\n\nIt is sort of a waste of time to try and convey the new COSMOS in words. You simply have to watch - and feel it. I liked what I saw and I have to say that my concerns about Tyson trying to fill Sagan's shoes - and missing - evaporated instantly. Tyson reverentially took the small dandelion seed last held by Sagan a generation ago, and then shot off - confidently - in his re-imagined ship of the imagination.\n\nI have lived with the original COSMOS in my head for more than 30 years. It is not going to go away and I am incapable of not comparing the new and the old versions. Both series are boundary-pushing creatures of their respective times - and hosts. Yet millions have never seen the original.\n\nI will save my overall commentary on the new incarnation of COSMOS until I have seen the entire collection of episodes. But I can talk about the original series and how it and its creator, Carl Sagan, affected me personally. Inextricably linked as these two stereoisomers are, insight into one provides a possible prediction of what impact the other has had or will have.\n\nThe original series was hosted by the original science geek mega star, Carl Sagan. COSMOS was unique even in its own time. Using the uninterrupted PBS format, state of the art special effects, and flawless writing, the original COSMOS (and its companion book) brought together a wide range of seemingly unrelated ideas. No one had quite mixed biology, sociology, cosmology, history, geology, and astronomy as COSMOS did. Today, we call this fusion \"Astrobiology.\" More on that later.\n\nIn the 1980s, it was common practice for high-end PBS series to have a companion book. There was no Internet back then, so in order to get more background on the topics raised on TV, you had to refer to books. Many of the books produced for PBS series were outstanding works in their own right. Some were better than the TV show itself. The companion volume for COSMOS went quite a bit further. It was - and still is - simply splendid. Again, a decade before the Internet, when home VCRs were still not all that common, once you watched something on TV - that was it. In the case of COSMOS, the official companion book was like a printed version of what we'd call a \"website\" today. The book simply served to further embed the myriad of threads COSMOS brought together - and did so years after COSMOS vanished from television. Its just a beautiful book.\n\nAlas, the new COSMOS does not have a book. It does have a website and an App that has yet to be released. And instead of waiting for a book, the Internet itself exploded with vast numbers of tweets and postings. In 1980 we sat and watched COSMOS on a TV screen. The new COSMOS invited us to participate - and help shape its own reception - in real time - everywhere.\n\nThe original COSMOS companion book has been re-released as an ebook - alas, with none of the lavish illustrations. While the greatest aspect of COSMOS was the words chosen to accompany the majestic vistas on the screen, reading the ebook without the images is to look at a ghost of what the original book encompassed. I certainly hope the producers reconsider this oversight and re-issue the original book in all its glory.\n\nFor me, COSMOS was a personal experience - one that has never left me. I saw it at a time when my education and my future careers were about to intersect. Its imagery and ideas affected me as I went on to finish by biology degrees and then work for, around, and within NASA. I was not alone. Indeed, if you watch the opening episode it says \"by Carl Sagan\" which is replaced by \"A Personal Voyage\". At the end of the new COSMOS, Neil Tyson makes mention of his first meeting with Carl Sagan when he was a teenager. He does so sitting in the same location on the California coast where Sagan first launched COSMOS more than a generation ago. A personal voyage indeed.\n\nI know dozens of people who can trace their careers directly back to their interactions with Carl Sagan. I know many more who can point to instances where a NASA scientist or university researcher took them under their wings and, in so doing, launched a career. This still happens today but, well, with the Internet the process of touching people is simplified and complicated by the very same technologies we now employ. That said, the President of the United States introduced COSMOS the other night urging people to learn and explore. Maybe this new COSMOS will get people thinking about mentoring the next generation once again.\n\nI did not know Carl Sagan - I only met him once (briefly). But, like others, I have certainly encountered his influence again and again and again.\n\nMy first introduction to Carl Sagan was in 6th grade when I took out a new library book titled \"Intelligent Life In The Universe\". Sagan co-wrote this book (actually, he edited and expanded a translated version) from a distance (it was the Cold War after all) with Russian scientist I.S. Shklovski. This book is where I first saw scientific nomenclature, equations, poetry, and artwork on the same page - where biology and cosmology often occupied the same sentence. This was my first introduction to the as-yet unborn field of Astrobiolgy. It is also where I picked up an odd habit that I still have: drawing little triangles in handwritten notes and in text books to accentuate passages. If you have read the book you know what I am referring to.\n\nThis book also introduced my to space flight hardware - a preview of my future career. Pictured in the middle of the book was \"Gulliver\", a proposed life detection experiment for a future Mars lander. I was so taken by it that several years later I built a quasi-functional replica for science class out of household items and an old fishing pole. A small garbage can was its outer payload shroud. No one at school - including my teacher - knew what to make of it.\n\nWhen COSMOS first aired in 1980 I was helping to close down Jerry Brown's 1980 Presidential campaign in Los Angeles. I did not have a TV at home so every Sunday I'd head over to the campaign office to watch COSMOS on the largest Sony Trinitron there was - the widescreen TV of the day. It was mesmerizing. Working for Jerry Brown I had a lot of interesting opportunities including the Voyager Saturn encounters at JPL which overlapped with the first run of COSMOS on TV. For me this was rather exciting to say the least - I'd see things on TV and then be in the same room with the people making things happen the next day. Heady stuff.\n\nIn the late 1980s I bumped into Sagan in print again. I was running research proposal peer review panels for NASA's old Life Sciences Division. Among the topics of the proposals under review was exobiology, the more focused precursor of what eventually morphed into astrobiology. In the new COSMOS, Neil Tyson notes the pervasive influence Sagan had on NASA's research. Sagan did this by managing to get himself included on virtually every mission team or working group there was. As such, when proposals were being reviewed, his resume was included with the other team members. Sagan;s resume was thick. Everything he wrote was included. I can recall wondering about this since no one else really did this.\n\nIt soon became clear that this propensity for being asked to explain things to the public was an asset that many mission teams liked to have. And Sagan's resume was a living thing. I recall one time when there were two proposals under review for different things. Sagan's resume for one proposal had a \"last revised\" date that differed from another resume he submitted for a different proposal by a week or so - and yet one resume had an additional page of citations/publications. He was THAT popular.\n\nMy only personal encounter with Carl Sagan was in 1988 at the First Space Life Sciences Symposium for which I had organized the logistics. Sagan was about to go onto the stage to speak . I handed him his laser pointer. Recall that this was 1988 and these things were the size of flashlights. I said \"Here's your SDI - Star Wars - Laser pointer\" I said to Sagan. A big opponent of the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative aka \"Star Wars\", he laughed at my pun and then took the stage. He then shamelessly ripped me off and repeated my pun - and the audience roared. How awesome was that: Carl Sagan stole my joke!\n\nIn August 1996 I was helping to run a large meeting of biologists in Seattle. Some big news from NASA broke: ALH84001 aka the \"Mars Meteorite\" announcement. Although the news evolved later, for that one day I got to walk from one session to another saying that NASA was announcing evidence of life on Mars. I had tears in my eyes - this was something I (a space biologist) had waited my whole life for. At NASA headquarters that day one of the presenters at the announcement closed by quoting Sagan saying \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\". As I rushed from one session to the next with this news, Carl Sagan lay dying a short distance away from me. He passed a few months later in Seattle.\n\nNASA's Astrobiolgy program was shocked into existence in the aftermath of the ALH84001 announcement. My last encounter with Sagan's influence was after his death. I was a participant in all of the workshops that led to the creation of NASA's new Astrobiology program. As we went through working groups and defined what this new discipline would be called we constantly found ourselves referring to things that had been so clearly thought out in COSMOS and other things Sagan had written or produced. The fact that virtually everyone in these meetings (hundred or more) knew Sagan personally is a testament to just how influential he was and how his ideas affected what we were creating. Neil Tyson was not exaggerating. Even people who did not like Sagan found themselves weaving his memes into their projects. I was really inspired by these meetings and bought the domain astrobiology.com. Google the term \"astrobiology\". My site regularly outranks NASA's sites in search results.\n\nCOSMOS stood alone for so long as a collection of 14 episodes of memes and visions. I thought it would be hard to accept the notion of a sequel. To be honest, I always felt that the movie \"Contact\" was the sequel to COSMOS. Sagan's one work of fiction (that I know of) brought together every notion of awesome cosmic immensity that he had discussed in various places blended with a very personal revelation of our own personal place therein.\n\nAt the end of Contact, the last frame shows a simple \"for Carl\" as a bookend of sorts to COSMOS. As I watched the opening of the new COSMOS the other night, I felt something familiar - it was the music. Just as those last piano notes played I realized what the screen would show an instant later - that the composer was Alan Silvestri who also wrote the score for \"Contact\". As such, these three compositions have been joined together - at least for me.\n\nAgain, the new COSMOS has yet to totally reveal itself. Many viewers have never seen the original series, so this is a first time experience for them. For me its a chance to revisit the old COSMOS of which I am so fond as I embrace a new one - one that will hopefully have a similar effect. Then I will have to wait until I am in my 90s for the cycle to begin anew once again.\n\nJust like the real Cosmos.\n\n\n\n- Astrobiology at T+5 Years, Keith Cowing and Baruch Blumberg (2002)\n\n- Going Off Source: Time away with SETI in West Virginia, Keith Cowing (1998)\n\n- Astrobiology Web\n\n\n\nPlease follow Astrobiology on Twitter.", "490": "\"Cosmos: A Personal Voyage\" first debuted on PBS in 1980, hosted by Carl Sagan. It introduced a generation to astrophysics, to the expansiveness of the universe, and to the beauty of science and the natural world.\n\nSagan passed away in 1996 and left a massive gap in the world of science education but the impression he made is still alive and well. Banksy said \"You die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time.\" With any luck, Sagan won't truly leave us for a very, very long time. His legacy lives on in those he taught, both in person and through his scientific outreach.\n\n\"A man is just flesh and blood and can be ignored or destroyed. But as a symbol... As a symbol, I can be incorruptible, everlasting.\" Those words didn't come from Sagan but they apply just the same. He isn't here to teach us anymore, but his message lives on, the torch is still lit and a new generation must carry it.\n\n\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" premiered last night on FOX. The show, hosted by Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson is a rebirth of Sagan's original idea, to bring science to the masses. To introduce us to massive, overbearing, overwhelming ideas in a way that we can comprehend. To take science out of the lab and into the living room.\n\nI was delighted to see the internet light up last night with people who were sitting down to watch the broadcast. The energy I've seen in the last 24 hours over an educational program has been exciting in its own right and deservedly so. The show was gorgeous, it introduced large ideas in an understandable way, it leveraged animation and imagination to show us things we can't see with our eyes. Travelling in the ship of imagination, we can see the past, the future, the infinite, the possible.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the premiere I began to get slightly worried. The universe is a big place, there is a lot of material to cover, even in thirteen hours. Within the first 14 minutes I realized that my worry was unnecessary. The first episode began with a brilliant introduction to our place in the cosmos, our cosmic address. Then seamlessly moved onto an astronomical history lesson. The pacing was wonderful and the imagery gorgeous.\n\nMy favorite segment however, was the last several minutes which consisted of a tribute to Carl Sagan. It seemed appropriate to give him his due, to take a few moments to memorialize the man who was responsible for it all.\n\nSagan was an intellectual king among men, and he left massive shoes to fill. Tyson steps into them wonderfully, he has the charm and the knowledge to carry the torch. I feel fortunate to live in a time of scientific rebirth, a new renaissance of curiosity and passion. I feel fortunate, when my three year old says he wants to be an astronaut, that I can sit him down on the couch and travel the universe with him. I feel fortunate that there are those educators like Dr. Tyson who can pick up where I leave off, who can fill the gaps of knowledge that I have, who can show him, and me, the universe.\n\nIf you didn't get a chance to watch it last night, you can catch it this evening on National Geographic, or you can watch it right now. I suggest that you do.\n\nCheers.\n\nPrevious Post: REVIEW: 'The Walking Dead' 4.13 \"Alone\"\n\nNext Post: Box Office Report\n\nTags: Cosmos , Sagan , FOX , Neil deGrasse Tyson", "491": "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is both ambitious and quaint. It attempts to convey humanity\u2019s most expansive ideas in the space of a weekly 44-minute TV series. That\u2019s ambitious. The show is also unabashed in its commitment to truth\u2014it matter-of-factly presents what we know about the universe, what we\u2019re pretty sure about, and what we don\u2019t know yet. Cosmos doesn\u2019t hedge: You won\u2019t hear the narrator, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, neuter any of his statements with a gratuitous \u201csome people believe\u2026\u201d counterpoint. He states the truth as a broad scientific consensus understands it today. In a media environment where truth has to compete with a \u201cbalance\u201d designed to prevent hurt feelings, Cosmos\u2019 straightforward tack is quaint\u2014laudably so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrandeur and forthrightness were also essential ingredients of Carl Sagan\u2019s original Cosmos: A Personal Voyage program\u2014which first aired on PBS in 1980\u2014and the new Cosmos doesn\u2019t stray far from the template that Sagan laid out. Like its inspiration, the Fox reboot (which also airs on National Geographic Channel) mixes awe-inspiring explorations of the universe with earthbound tales of scientists and thinkers. \u201cStanding Up In The Milky Way\u201d features two clever conceptualizations of our place in space and time, first zooming out farther and farther from our planet to establish Earth\u2019s \u201ccosmic address,\u201d and then condensing the history of the universe into a single year\u2014the \u201ccosmic calendar.\u201d (This latter device was also used on the first episode of Sagan\u2019s show.)\n\nThe \u201ccosmic address\u201d sequence that opens tonight\u2019s premiere is how Cosmos puts its best foot forward. Cruising in a computer-generated \u201cship of the imagination,\u201d Tyson narrates a travelogue through space as we know it, one that begins at Earth and proceeds to the edges of the known universe\u2014ending with a brief glimpse of a vast, theoretical multiverse. This is a visual-effects extravaganza, and Cosmos doesn\u2019t hesitate to indulge in eye candy. But the true feat here is how Cosmos\u2019 imagery overcomes our puny ability to conceive huge spaces. Each line on the cosmic address follows clearly from the last, and the sequence\u2019s methodical buildup lets viewers acquire a sliver of insight into our universe\u2019s baffling bigness or, to put it another way, our pathetic smallness.\n\nTyson\u2019s explanation of the comet-filled Oort Cloud that surrounds the solar system is rushed and confusing, a rare off-key moment in the opening segments. But that stumble foreshadows sloppy scripting that crops up more often later in the episode. The cosmic calendar is an elegant way to talk about the age of the universe without losing perspective in the boggling billions of years that came before us. Yet Tyson\u2019s narration jumps fitfully between the contrived time of the calendar and the real time of actual history, which makes for a scattered presentation. The calendar segments are also hurt by a few hokey moments, like when Tyson slides on a pair of sunglasses, \u00e0 la David Caruso, to watch the Big Bang. This silliness only distracts from what ought to be a moment of wonder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m quibbling. The cosmic calendar is still beautiful and moving. Sure, Sagan did it a bit better\u2014although, frankly, his cosmic calendar journey was sometimes confusing, too\u2014but each installment of Sagan\u2019s Cosmos had nearly a full hour to work with; this Cosmos covers roughly equivalent ground in about 44 minutes\u2019 time. And the thinking behind the sunglasses move is clear: Not everything can be stunning. The show needs to leaven its big ideas with grounded touches to keep its epic majesty from growing banal. That\u2019s the rub. If there is one characteristic flaw in the show so far, it is a struggle to communicate on the human level as well as it does on the cosmic scale.\n\nThis weakness is troublesome in the address and calendar segments; it becomes glaring in the middle portion of the episode, which tells the story of a 16th-century Dominican friar, Giordano Bruno. Imprisoned and ultimately executed by the Roman Inquisition, Bruno challenged conventional wisdom with his vision of an infinite universe full of suns and planets like our own. The Bruno story is animated, and perhaps this is the influence of executive producer Seth MacFarlane at work. If so, MacFarlane should have dipped a little deeper into his Rolodex. The animation is stiff, drab, and ugly\u2014out of sync with the world-class visual effects that grace the rest of the show.\n\nBruno\u2019s life story is used by Cosmos to advance a variety of messages, with mixed success. Most prominently, it\u2019s a ham-fisted cautionary tale that shows how the earthly interests of organized religion act as a threat to free thought. Most artfully, the Bruno segments demonstrate how imagination, properly contextualized, is an important part of the scientific process. Tyson hastens to note that Bruno\u2019s on-the-right-track visions of the cosmos were merely a \u201cguess\u201d\u2014they had no evidence to support them\u2014but that his ideas were still important because they \u201cgave others a target to aim at, if only to disprove it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat concluding sentiment aside, Tyson\u2019s narration is at its worst in the Giordano Bruno story, with notes of condescension and hyperbole. At one point, for instance, Tyson adopts dire tones to cast Bruno\u2019s persecutors as the \u201cthought police,\u201d which is pouring it on thick. The Inquisition does not need to be made more dystopian\u2014it\u2019s the freaking Inquisition. Tin-eared touches like these give the impression that the show is dumbing itself down for viewers, and while the line between dumbing-down and simplification may be thin, it\u2019s Cosmos\u2019 job to stay on the right side of the divide.\n\nCarl Sagan\u2019s communicative gifts lay not just in his ability to frame science in approachable terms, but also in his delivery. While the astronomer\u2019s odd voice\u2014sounding like it got accidentally lodged somewhere between his throat and his nose\u2014may have been mocked by comedians, it worked to his advantage. Thanks in part to that quirky speaking style and his gawkish overbite, Sagan was an earthbound personality. He didn\u2019t came off as the vaunted expert speaking down to his subjects. He was a peer\u2014merely another human, exulting with his audience in the marvelous truths that science has brought to light. Where Sagan spoke with a calm confidence, Tyson is often insistent. Both of them have earnest enthusiasm; Tyson is simply pushing too hard.\n\nTyson may relax into his role as TV communicator yet, however. The premiere concludes with a remembrance of Sagan. Tyson recaps some of his predecessor\u2019s scientific accomplishments, and then he tells the story of the first time he met Sagan. In these two minutes, Tyson finds a greater poignance than anything in the interminable Giordano Bruno sequence, and he does so by speaking from the heart about a friend. This echoes Sagan\u2019s greatest gift as a communicator: He implicitly treated all people as friends, with a bottomless compassion for the human race. Tyson shows glimpses of that same affection, and the show could use more of it from him\u2014not necessarily in an overt way, but detectable beneath the surface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most inspirational moment of this premiere is almost a throwaway line, and it comes during an explanation of the Big Bang. \u201cIt\u2019s as far back as we can see in time,\u201d Tyson says. There\u2019s a pause before he adds, \u201cFor now.\u201d Two words speak to the fundamental hope\u2014or faith, maybe\u2014of science, which is that through hard work, we can banish the dark of the greatest unknowns. (It\u2019s a notion that doesn\u2019t have to be incompatible with religious faiths, as \u201cStanding Up In The Milky Way\u201d briefly acknowledges.) Is this the spiritual side of scientific endeavor? \u201cSpiritual\u201d can be a junk word, a self-descriptor used by people who don\u2019t have religion but still believe in, you know, stuff. But if we define spirituality as the awareness of an order and connectedness much greater than ourselves, then yes, Cosmos is a spiritual show, and a mostly compelling one at that. Its gospel has the added benefit of being truth\u2014or as close as we can come, for now.", "492": "\u201cIn this spaceship of the imagination, free from the shackles of space and time, we can go anywhere.\u201d\n\nFrom the opening remarks courtesy of President Barack Obama, to the heartfelt closing that felt more like Neil DeGrasse Tyson sharing why he was qualified to pick up where Carl Sagan had left off so many years ago, every minute of the new Cosmos: a Spacetime Odyssey was everything any of us could have wanted it to be.\n\nThis new series, brought to life with the help of Executive Producer Seth MacFarlane and aiming to give people something new to do either on Sunday night on FOX or Monday night on National Geographic, strikes a perfect balance between new visual effects and maintaining the structure and format of the original.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive combination to pull off, especially with a shiny new spaceship layout and new animations for telling the stories of our past. Fortunately, we\u2019ve got a new guide with a fantastic presence and a clear mission in front of him \u2014 to use these new tools to educate as many people as possible about where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going. Don\u2019t worry though, he still knows exactly what we\u2019re all made of.\n\nThis first episode of Cosmos did exactly what it needed to do, which was to create a layout explaining what we know so far and placing markers for what we don\u2019t know yet. It demonstrates theory with impressive visuals, demonstrating just how small we really are right before diving right back down to Earth and showing us all how we came to understand that we are not the center of the Universe. This episode tells the tale of Giordano Bruno and what he went through long before people like Galileo were around to help him prove his theories.\n\nThe demonstration of Bruno\u2019s experiences were blunt and downright aggressive at points, demonstrating his run in with The Inquisition and his inability to deal with the way his theories were considered downright criminal were represented in spectacular fashion. It is a powerful message to start off the series, which was both deliberate and fantastic.\n\nAs the show continues to take form, Cosmos will exist digitally as well. During one of the commercial breaks it was made clear that there would be an interactive second screen app for iOS and Android available soon. In an attempt to install it during one of those breaks I found that it isn\u2019t widely available yet. Given the volume of Samsung commercials during the break and the Samsung Android phone used as the visual on the Cosmos website to show off the app, it would appear as though there\u2019s a temporary exclusivity there.\n\nWhile it\u2019s everything fans of the original Cosmos could possibly ask for, the show will need lots of new viewers to survive. Sunday night at 9pm Eastern forces Cosmos to compete with The Walking Dead for eyeballs, though the fact that it airs again the next day on another channel will likely help a great deal with that.\n\nSo far the show is perfect for people who were already going to watch it, and that might be enough on its own, but the real hurdle will be seeing whether or not this show is able to do what the original did and grab a whole new generation of eyeballs and lead them toward the sciences.\n\nUpdate: Here is Cosmos, Ep1, in full!", "493": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) \u2014 Starting Sunday, Fox\u2019s \u201cFamily Guy\u201d will be followed by the unlikeliest of network television shows: an hour-long scientific exploration of the universe called \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.\u201d\n\nThe 13-week series is a reimagining of the 1980 PBS series \u201cCosmos: A Personal Voyage.\u201d Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson takes the place of the original host Carl Sagan, who died in 1996.\n\nScience has \u201cgot to be mainstreamed in some way,\u201d Tyson said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d \u201cOtherwise, people will view it as something to ignore or to step around.\u201d\n\nWhat better way to mainstream it than a 9 p.m. time slot on the Fox network, usually taken up by animated comedies?\n\nTyson and the other proponents of the series \u2014 like \u201cFamily Guy\u201d executive producer Seth MacFarlane \u2014 say they\u2019ll be able to reach people who aren\u2019t fans of PBS\u2019s \u201cNOVA\u201d or subscribers to Scientific American magazine.\n\nThere are people \u201cwho don\u2019t know that they like science,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cThey have a little flame inside of them of curiosity, and we\u2019re going to fan that flame.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then there\u2019s another category of people \u2014 the people who know they don\u2019t like science. They\u2019ve got no flame at all,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to go in there and light it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCosmos\u201d represents a bet by the Fox network\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, that Tyson and his producers can do just that.\n\nThe episodes take advantage of special effects technology and Tyson\u2019s accessible story-telling style to teach scientific concepts like evolution. Fox is promoting it as an adventure tale.\n\nThere was abundant surprise in 2011 when the network announced its interest in remaking \u201cCosmos.\u201d\n\nFor several years, Sagan\u2019s widow, Ann Druyan, and collaborator Steven Soter had been shopping the project around without success. Their luck began to turn when MacFarlane asked Tyson to lunch in 2009.\n\n\u201cHe came to me, and I said sure. I didn\u2019t tell him that I had to move 30 things around to make the lunch,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nAt lunch, MacFarlane \u201casked me 30 questions about the Big Bang and cosmology,\u201d Tyson recalled. The conversation informed a future \u201cFamily Guy\u201d episode, and more importantly, it got MacFarlane interested in the effort to reboot \u201cCosmos.\u201d\n\nMacFarlane, who produces several successful comedies for Fox and thus has network executives on speed dial, later arranged a pitch meeting for Druyan. \u201cWe were sort of mutually incredulous at the beginning,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nBut Fox executives Kevin Reilly and Peter Rice \u201cboth liked the idea of doing something that no one had ever done before,\u201d MacFarlane told USA Today. So MacFarlane and Druyan\u2019s production companies got to work.\n\nThe 13 episodes revive some storytelling tools from the original \u201cCosmos,\u201d like the Cosmic Calendar, and trot out new ones.\n\n\u201cThe difference today is not only have visual effects advanced, but because this is airing on a major network, we had the resources \u2014 we had access to people who have told these great dramatic stories on the big screen,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nHe described how the camera becomes \u201ca participant in the storytelling\u201d in ways not previously possible.\n\n\u201cSo, yes, we go into a black hole,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dip down near the surface of the sun. And you feel it. I mean psychologically, you feel that it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, airing the series in prime time on a major network is a risk, MacFarlane added in his interview with USA Today. \u201cThere\u2019s really no way of telling how it\u2019s going to do. It could be a disaster or it could be a huge hit or somewhere in between,\u201d he said.\n\nA disaster is unlikely, if only because the series is backed by a multi-million dollar marketing campaign and what 21st Century Fox calls a \u201cmulti-network launch event.\u201d\n\nThe first episode of \u201cCosmos\u201d won\u2019t just be seen on the Fox broadcast network. It will be screened simultaneously on nine of the company\u2019s cable channels, including FX, Fox Sports 1 and the National Geographic Channel.\n\nNational Geographic Channel will also re-run episodes of \u201cCosmos\u201d on Monday nights, one day after Fox. International distribution deals will beam the series to TV screens in 181 countries \u2014 only one planet, though, at least for now.", "494": "How did the first episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey treat religion?\n\nDanielle: Last week, Neil deGrasse Tyson promised Brian Stelter that he would be casting a wide net, audience-wise, with Cosmos. He would aim to attract viewers \u201cwho don\u2019t know that they like science,\u201d but who \u201chave a little flame inside of them of curiosity,\u201d but also those \u201cwho know they don\u2019t like science. They\u2019ve got no flame at all. So we\u2019re going to go in in there and light it.\u201d This is an admirable (if unrealistic) goal, and one that Tyson seems to have embraced in episode one by inviting religious viewers to identify with scientists.\n\nAbby: It\u2019s interesting, because at least one early review of the show suggested that the reboot lost one of the things that made the original Cosmos so special: its ambitious view that every single person on the planet possessing an ounce of wonder could appreciate the cosmos, religious or not. But now that I\u2019ve actually watched the new one, its clear Tyson obviously takes that scientific missionary work seriously, too.\n\nDanielle: Yeah, I expected some subtlety in the program\u2019s attempt to bring a religious audience around to Tyson\u2019s point of view (namely, evolution,) but there was no ambiguity about the fact that Tyson wants its viewers to see the scientifically oppressed as akin to the religiously martyred. The story of Giordano Bruno is used to illustrate this parallel -- he\u2019s a monk who saw a scientifically accurate \u201cvision\u201d of the cosmos, a revelation that he held dear despite persecution and, ultimately, execution. Bruno was a martyr, Tyson tells us, as he walks us through the (beautifully animated) stages of his oppressed life.\n\nAbby: You know, the interesting thing about the Bruno story to me is the fact that it\u2019s a defense of faith, and not of science. Bruno had no evidence to back up his version of the cosmos, as correct as it turned out to be. His value to Tyson\u2019s narrative is that he challenged established, unscientific \u201cfacts.\u201d I\u2019m wondering how the Bruno interlude will go over with some factions of the religious audience the show clearly wants to court: although almost any sane person living in the year 2014 would agree that the Inquisition is a good a source for a historical villain as any, it was still a religious institution.\n\nI\u2019m hoping, and I think the show\u2019s writers are hoping, that viewers will understand the Bruno story not as a condemnation of religion, but as a redrawing of the boundaries between faith and science. Instead of putting the two in opposition, the show wants to place faith, curiosity, wonder, and questioning \u2014 what if my God is too small? to paraphrase Bruno \u2014 along with science against enforced ignorance.\n\nDanielle: Yes! Tyson\u2019s unapologetic looping of faith into science was a pretty bold move, and I\u2019m also curious to hear what some scientists think of it -- posing scientific discovery as based on, at best, a hunch, and at worst divine intervention might raise some eyebrows. The fact that he\u2019s shattering expectations on both sides could allow the rest of the show to explore scientific phenomena in a very fluid way.", "495": "\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" premiered Sunday night (March 9), rebooting the series that the late astronomer Carl Sagan turned into a TV classic 34 years ago.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of sleek graphics and astronomical imagery, host Neil deGrasse Tyson brought a new generation of viewers up to speed about our place in the cosmos. In the hour-long premiere, Tyson broke down each line in our cosmic address, from Earth to the farthest reaches of the observable universe, and he time-traveled through the cosmic calendar from the Big Bang to the present.\n\nSome of these morsels may be old news for veteran \"Cosmos\" fans and space buffs, but here's seven awesome things we learned in the series premiere:\n\n1. Jupiter has hurricane three times the size of Earth\n\nStarting with Sagan, \"Cosmos\" has a long tradition of throwing Earth into scale. The first episode of the new series showed that even within our own solar system our home planet looks relatively small \u2014 especially compared to Jupiter.\n\n\"With its four giant moons and dozens of smaller moons, Jupiter is like its own little solar system,\" Tyson said. \"It has more mass than all of the other planets combined.\"\n\nTyson then pointed out the gas planet's Great Red Spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth that's been plaguing Jupiter for centuries.\n\n2. Our solar system has a huge shell that no one can see\n\nOur solar system is enclosed by a swarm of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud, but as a whole, this shell is imperceptible to humans. That's because these comets \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation \u2014 are separated from each other by hundreds of millions of miles.\n\n\"Each one of these little worlds is as far from it's nearest neighbor as Earth is from Saturn,\" Tyson said.\n\n'Cosmos' by Carl Sagan, The best-selling science book ever published in the English language, COSMOS is a magnificent overview of the past, present, and future of science.

Our universe may be part of a multiverse\n\nThe \"observable universe,\" is listed as the last line in our cosmic address (Earth is first) in the inaugural episode of the new \"Cosmos.\" But as Tyson says, this may only be our cosmic horizon.\n\n\"Many of us suspect that all of this \u2014 all the worlds, stars, galaxies and clusters in our observable universe \u2014 is but one tiny bubble in an infinite ocean of other universes,\" Tyson said. In other words, we could be living in a multiverse.\n\n4. Our cosmic perspective is relatively new\n\nCosmically speaking, it wasn't so long ago that humans thought Earth was the center of the universe. (Actually you can still find humans who believe this; a recent survey found that 1 in 4 Americans thinks the sun revolves around Earth.)\n\n\"Cosmos\" illustrates just how dangerous it was to challenge cosmic mores a mere 400 years ago through the tale of Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by executive producer Seth MacFarlane). Bruno suggested that we live in a boundless universe, orbiting one of many stars. His reward? Imprisonment and a fiery death at the stake.\n\n5. In the cosmic calendar, Jesus was born just 5 seconds ago\n\nThose who watched Sagan's original series will remember the cosmic calendar, which is a way to conceptualize the age of the universe (13.8 billion years). Tyson revived the tool, explaining that Jan. 1 would mark the Big Bang and the present falls on midnight on Dec. 31. At this scale, every day represents nearly 40 million years and humans only evolved in the last hour of New Year's Eve.\n\nCOSMOS FirstScope Telescope, Celestron Newtonian reflector optical system features a spherical mirror with a generous 76 mm of aperture.

Carl Sagan and new \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson go way back\n\nOne poignant moment in the \"Cosmos\" premiere occurred at the end, where host Neil deGrasse Tyson touched on Sagan's legacy in astronomy and science communication. Tyson showed a day calendar from 1975 - Sagan's own daily planner - with a meeting with Tyson penned in on a Saturday. Sagan had invited the then 17-year-old Tyson to Ithaca, N.Y., where Sagan taught at Cornell University, for a visit. It was snowing when the young Tyson went to catch the bus back home to the Bronx. Sagan gave Tyson his home phone number, and invited the student to call him if the bus didn't show and spend the weekend with his family. \"\"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist, but that afternoon I learned what kind of person I wanted to be,\" Tyson said in the premiere.\n\n7. We are made of star stuff\n\nLong-time \"Cosmos\" fans were waiting for this moment and Tyson delivered.\n\nHe explained that the stuff of life and the elements familiar to us on Earth today were cooked inside the hearts of collapsing stars billions of years ago.\n\n\"They get so hot that the nuclei of the atoms fuse together deep within them to make the oxygen with breathe, the carbon in our muscles, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood,\" Tyson said. \"You, me, everyone: We are made of star stuff.\"\n\nThe premiere of \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will re-air tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the National Geographic Channel and include some extra material on the making of the show.\n\nFollow Megan Gannon on Twitter and Google+.

The host of the new version of the show will be Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. The aim of the show is to enable people to experience the wonders of science by sharing complex knowledge in simpler form. The show will present exciting information related to astronomy, biology and other fields of study.\n\nThe original version, hosted by Carl Sagan, had helped people have a look around the universe through a 'Ship of the Imagination', which travelled through the Cosmos without any constraints of time or velocity. But the new one has come back with an updated look.\n\nThe show will broadcast to 170 countries, which is the largest roll-out of a television show in TV history. The show began March 9 on FOX.\n\nTyson said the show will enable viewers understand where they live in the universe. During the first episode, Tyson discussed various topics ranging from dinosaurs to the best way to lie to your children in a passionate manner. He was hilarious, charismatic and personable.\n\nTyson also discussed the importance of allowing people to experiment with the world. He said that children especially should try to find information behind their world in their own way. Even if the results are broken eggs, children will come to know that just because the egg is hard, it does not mean that it is too strong.\n\nTyson also told the story of Giordano Bruno, a 16th Century monk who was set on fire because of his ideas. The Italian claimed that the Sun is a star and there are multiple planets in the universe.\n\nTyson and Carl Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan, have worked together to produce the new show.

His groundbreaking miniseries, \"Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,\" used visual effects and down-to-earth commentary to bring science into people's homes.\n\nA reboot of the show, called \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\" premiered on Fox Sunday, March 9. Hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the \"Cosmos\" reboot uses Sagan's unique brand of education to bring his message of science literacy to a new generation of viewers. Tyson also has an early memory of Sagan's influence on his life and work. [See Carl Sagan's legacy in photos]\n\n[pullquote]\n\n\"I was just a 17-year-old kid from the Bronx with dreams of becoming a scientist, and somehow, the world's most famous astronomer found time to invite me to Ithaca in upstate New York and spend a Saturday with him,\" Tyson said during the first episode of the \"Cosmos\" reboot. \"I remember that snowy day like it was yesterday.\"\n\n\"I already knew I wanted to be a scientist, but that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become,\" Tyson added. \"He reached out to me and to countless others, inspiring so many of us to study, teach and do science. Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations.\"\n\nCarl Sagan also inspired another person who's helping with the \"Cosmos\" reboot. Seth MacFarlane \u2014creator of \"Family Guy\" and an executive producer of the new \"Cosmos\" \u2014 has been a fan of Sagan since he was a child.\n\n\"I have always been interested in science,\" MacFarlane said at a recent \"Cosmos\" event. \"I remember seeing the original 'Cosmos' as a child and as an adolescent and as an adult. I've seen it a number of times.\"\n\nSagan also put life on Earth into perspective. He orchestrated the \"pale blue dot\" photo taken by Voyager from more than 4 billion miles away, showing Earth as a tiny point of light, as humans have never seen it before.\n\n\"Every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on the moat of dust suspended in a sunbeam,\" Sagan said of the photo. \"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast, cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.\"\n\nSagan was more than a public figure and science communicator; he also contributed to science and exploration. Voyager 1, now the farthest man-made object ever launched into space, carries a piece of Sagan's legacy with it into interstellar space: Each of the Voyager probes holds a golden record inscribed with messages and sounds from Earth curated by a committee chaired by Sagan.\n\n\"The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space,\" Sagan said. \"But the launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet.\"\n\nSagan was the first to create a greenhouse model for Venus' atmosphere, showing that the planet had much higher temperatures than previously thought. Sagan was also a NASA adviser for the Viking mission to Mars (the first U.S. lander on the Red Planet) and other missions in the solar system.", "498": "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage was a 13-part TV series that first appeared on television in 1980. The series tackled a wide range of scientific topics including Carl Sagan\u2019s perspective of our existence in the universe and the origin of life.\n\nOn March 9, a reboot of Cosmos entitled Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey premiered with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. The series is produced by Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy. MacFarlane decided to enter the project after a meeting with Tyson. McFarlane was interested to know if Tyson was doing a scientific project that he could be part of. Tyson then encouraged MacFarlane to back a project by Ann Druyan, Sagan\u2019s widow, on a remake of Cosmos. MacFarlane got on board and produced the series together with Druyan, and Brannon Braga, the producer of Star Trek.\n\nIn an interview with National Geographic, Tyson said that now is a good time to recreate Sagan\u2019s Cosmos, as there have been a lot of changes in the last 34 years. Since the program\u2019s last airing, thousands of new planets have been discovered.\n\nTyson also said that the reboot features a new way of storytelling through cinematic that may provide emotional fulfillment for viewers. He also said that the purpose of the show is not to educate viewers about the latest scientific discoveries, but to tell the stories that will allow viewers to understand how science is the center of our lives.\n\nThe reboot follows the structure of the original show, but there are some notable differences that make Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey blunter. The premiere ended with Tyson explaining his personal connection to Sagan, and how he was dazzled by the late astronomer\u2019s compassion and intelligence.\n\nAccording to Tyson, he wants viewers to walk away from watching the show realizing \u201chow far we have come and how wonderful is this world of ours.\u201d\n\nThe 13-part series airs on Fox and the National Geographic Channel.\n\nNeil Degrasse Tyson Talks About \u2018Cosmos\u2019\n\nImage via YouTube", "499": "US President Obama will deliver the introduction to the new Fox science series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey in the premiere episode, which airs in the UAE on National Geographic HD every Saturday at 6pm.

In mid-February, Nguyen pulled the game because he was concerned that it had \"become an addictive product.\" Feedback from those who either played or knew of Flappy Bird contributed to his concern. He's kept messages from people who criticized him for \"distracting the children of the world.\" He heard of people breaking their phones and losing their jobs.\n\n\"At first I thought they were just joking,\" Nguyen said, \"but I realize they really hurt themselves.\"\n\nThose who downloaded it can still play Flappy Bird, and he continues to earn \"tens of thousands of dollars\" from the game. Asked whether he might reintroduce Flappy Bird at some point, he said it's a possibility.\n\n\"I'm considering it,\" he said.\n\nIf Flappy Bird does return for sale, its creator also said it would do so with a warning imploring players to \"Please take a break.\"\n\nSince its takedown, many Flappy Bird clones have appeared in mobile app stores.

Dong Nguyen, the 28-year-old Hanoi, Vietnam-based game designer, is still making tens of thousands of dollars off the addictive mobile hit that pushed smartphone users to a game-playing fever pitch, as well as his other titles, Shuriken Block and Super Ball Juggling, that earned success by association.\n\nThe clones are countless; a new one was sprouting up on the App Store an average of every 24 minutes in the immediate wake of Flappy Bird's demise. Even now, three knockoffs currently sit in the top 10 of free iOS games. And announcing via Twitter that he was pulling Flappy Bird with one day's notice earned the game more than 10 million downloads in 22 hours alone.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n\"I can't go back to my life before, but I'm good now,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published Tuesday, accompanied by a picture of the chain-smoking Nguyen with his now-trademark look: clean-cut with minimalistic dress and a cigarette hanging from his mouth. But despite finally finding peace from the torrent of online abuse, criticism, and allegations of fraud, Nguyen reasserted that the decision to yank Flappy Bird from the spotlight was as much for his own mental well-being as it was for those who played his creation.\n\nNguyen detailed some of the more personal interactions with those who fell prey to the kind of addictive tendencies that game makers like King now purposefully target with Candy Crush and other top-grossing mobile hits. For instance, Nguyen was told of people who had lost their jobs, mothers who had stopped speaking with their children, and school children who had smashed their phones, all apparently because of Flappy Bird and its addictive design. It was something Nguyen never intended or asked for, and yet had no control over.\n\n\"At first I thought they were just joking,\" he said. \"But I realize they really hurt themselves.\" Nguyen pointed out that, as an avid Counter Strike fan whose grades suffered from his over-playing, he knows how games can be as addictive and destructive as any other vice, and that he hated the fact that he was putting people through that. \"Please take a break,\" a suggestion Nguyen began tweeting to obsessive Flappy Bird players in the waning days of his sparse online presence, will now accompany any future games Nguyen releases in the form of a warning message.\n\nRolling Stone's David Kushner also got Nguyen to open up about his upbringing and design influences. Nguyen revealed that he first fell in love with games by playing Super Mario Bros. on a knockoff Nintendo his parents bought for him and his brother because of the expensive nature of imported electronics, especially early GameBoys.\n\nA hand-drawn picture of Mario even sat above his desk throughout the course of the holiday weekend celebrating Reunificatifion Day, marking the end of the Vietnam War, that Nguyen spent creating Flappy Bird. The intention was simple: Make a game that could be played with one hand on the subway, and could process the simplest input -- a single tap -- anywhere on the screen, yet make it simple and incredibly difficult to get good at, like a paddle ball toy. Throwing in some nostalgic Nintendo love from his childhood, Nguyen pushed out Flappy Bird and watched as it lay dormant for months. Six months after its release, the game received its first mention on Twitter and, through a textbook instance of unexplainable virality, hit the top of the charts by the end of January.\n\nScreenshots by Nick Statt/CNET\n\nYears earlier, Nguyen spent time honing his programming, building a chess game at age 16 and, at age 19, joining Punch Entertainment, a Hanoi game studio that was a rarity for the Vietnam capital back in the early '00s. There he earned a reputation for independent thinking and coding proficiency. Nguyen echoed that assessment when asked for the defining reason he pulled Flappy Bird: \"I'm master of my own fate,\" he said. \"Independent thinker.\"\n\nIt was originally reported last month that Nguyen lived with his parents in a modest home. Now, thanks to his wealth, he's thinkng of buying his own apartment and a Mini Cooper while he stays with a friend. With his first passport and the financial cushion to quit his job, Nguyen is back to designing games, including a jetpack endless-runner variant called Kitty Jetpack and a chess game called Checkonaut.\n\nAs for an official Flappy Bird rebirth, \"I'm considering it,\" Nguyen said. Beyond that, he doesn't spend too much time thinking about the game's rise, the aftermath of its popularity explosion or the numerous clones it's still now generating, though he sees frequent offers from interested buyers. \"People can clone the app because of its simplicity,\" he said, \"but they will never make another Flappy Bird.\"", "515": "Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen dropped a surprising bombshell in an interview with Rolling Stone - he's \"considering\" bringing the game back to the App Store and Google Play.\n\nNguyen's decision is an unexpected move, considering the tone of his communication when he unceremoniously pulled the game on 9 February.\n\n\"22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this any more.\" Nguyen tweeted shortly after he complained that the \"success\" of a game \"ruins my simple life\".\n\nReturning to roost\n\nThe move by Nguyen was unthinkable - at the top of his game, and the App Store charts, he pulled the plug on a viral hit that was generating an estimated $50,000 per day.\n\nShortly after Flappy Bird's disappearance, a seemingly endless flood of clones washed over the App Store and Google Play - but none of these concern Nguyen.\n\n\"People can clone the app because of its simplicity,\" he says, \"but they will never make another Flappy Bird.\"\n\n\n\nA valuable nest egg\n\nRolling Stone also notes that the millions of Flappy Bird installs are still \"generating tens of thousands of dollars\" for Nguyen courtesy of its in-game ads.\n\nThis revenue stream has changed Nguyen - incidentally - although perhaps for the better. He's retired from his day job to focus on developing games full-time and is considering moving out from his parent's flat to his own living space.\n\nHe's even considering splurging on a Mini Cooper.\n\nBut one thing he's not considering is selling Flappy Bird or revamping it. Nguyen mused that he only change he'd include to the prospective re-release would be a \"warning\" on Flappy Bird that reminds players to \"please take a break\".\n\n[source: Rolling Stone]", "516": "Remember when game developer Dong Nguyen got so fed up with the attention his simple sidescroller Flappy Bird was getting that he deleted it from app stores entirely? Yeah, maybe he\u2019s changed his mind. Not getting $50,000 dollars a day in ad revenue will do that to a person, we guess.\n\nAccording to his recent interview with Rolling Stone, Nguyen is \u201cconsidering\u201d bringing the game back online, with one added caveat: that the game would now tell players to take breaks after they\u2019ve been at it for extended periods of time. Please, like anyone will listen to that. Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds practically begged me to stop playing it, and did I listen? No sir.\n\nNguyen first removed the game from the iTunes app store and Google Play after he became concerned that players were too addicted to getting that bird to flap between those pipes. Which doesn\u2019t necessarily seem fair, considering that he designed the game to be played one-handed on long train rides. Maybe he was worried that those commuters were all missing their stops due to Flappy Bird? Still, Nguyen definitely didn\u2019t deserve the insane amounts of criticism he got for the game in the first place, so we understand his desire to remove himself from the spotlight. He just better not expect anyone to get as excited about the game as they once did if it does return. Most of us are pretty much over it by now.\n\n(via The Verge, image via Flappy Bird)\n\nMeanwhile in related links", "517": "Flappy Bird.

As we watched this story unfold earlier this month, it proved an interesting break from the sort of corporate PR speak that usually dominates games media -- here was a guy, just a guy, suddenly the biggest deal in the video gaming world and dealing with it a sometimes painfully human way.\n\nFor his part, we can remember that despite not getting any money from new players, the millions-strong existing player base still contributes to his ad-revenue, so he's got a nice income even if he's stopped allowing installs. One hopes that things work out well for him -- it's hard to see someone as out there as he was and not feel some sympathy -- but I imagine they will. Give it some time to cool down, and he can get a job at any number of developers on sheer celebrity.\n\nI do wonder what would happen if Flappy Bird came back, though. It would most certainly hit the top of the app store on mystique alone, even if it does have an army clones to contend with now.

He said that the future of Hanoi influenced the gameplay. People rushing through the streets of Hanoi, transfixed on their phones, led to the simple tap control of the game.\n\nHe said the scoring for the game was influenced by \"one of the most masocore analog creations ever: paddleball.\"\n\nSince taking Flappy Bird down Nguyen said he felt relief. \"I can't go back to my life before, but I'm good now,\" he said.\n\n[Rolling Stone]", "523": "Almost exactly a month after Flappy Bird maker Dong Nguyen took down his surprisingly viral hit from the iOS App Store (launching a tidal wave of clones in the process), the reclusive developer has said that he is \"considering\" putting the game up for download once more.\n\nRolling Stone scored a rare interview with Nguyen, who has shunned the spotlight since becoming something of an Internet celebrity in the wake of Flappy Bird's sudden rise and fall (from the iOS store at least). The mention of a potential App Store return for Flappy Bird comes near the end of the story, though Nguyen says the game would come back with a warning: \"Please take a break.\" (That's an entreaty Wii Sports owners are quite familiar with). The game's return would likely be greeted warmly by those not among the tens of millions who downloaded the game before it was taken down, though not as warmly by those trying to sell Flappy Bird equipped phones for thousands.\n\nIn the new interview, Nguyen follows up on previously discussed worries that the game he created became an \"addictive product\" that was harming people through overuse. He told the magazine that he suffered in school from an addiction to Counter-Strike, and Nguyen shared some distressing messages of similar addiction that he received since the game became a hit. \"Thirteen kids at my school broke their phones because of your game, and they still play it cause it's addicting like crack,\" one message read.\n\nNguyen also addressed how Flappy Bird's success ruined the \"simple life\" he enjoyed living with his parents in Vietnam. He even had to move in with a friend when his parents' house was swarmed by local paparazzi and reporters. Those parents knew nothing of their son's viral success\u2014and the estimated ad payments of $50,000 a day\u2014until the reporters came calling, apparently. \"My parents don't understand games,\" he said.\n\nAs for the game's design inspiration, Nguyen, who once cranked out sports games for a Vietnamese mobile game developer, cites the familiar children's paddle ball toy. It's incredibly simple to use but tough to keep going for more than a couple of hits. This simplicity is key for the mobile gaming environment, he said, where players usually just have one thumb to use. \"When you play game on a smartphone, the simplest way is just tapping.\"\n\nThough it felt \"amazing\" to see his game on top of the App Store charts, Nguyen said he \"couldn't be too happy\" with the success. \"I don't know why,\" he said.

Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen spoke with David Kushner, of the previously mentioned Rolling Stone. Some of the story will likely sound a bit familiar to those who had been following closely, however there are plenty of gems still included. You learn a little bit about him, and also a little bit about why he decided to create this game.\n\nNguyen mentioned how he wanted to create a game for someone like himself \u2014 busy and always on the go. To that point, he said he pictured how people would be playing with one hand holding the device up in the air, and the other holding the strap on the train. Hence the easy one-handed game play that was found with Flappy Bird. He also made it clear he was only trying to make \u201csomething fun to share with other people\u201d and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t predict the success.\u201d", "525": "Now that Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen has enjoyed a month out of the spotlight, he\u2019s thinking about bringing back his hit game, and releasing some new ones.\n\nRolling Stone\u2019s David Kushner managed to track down Nguyen in his home town of Hanoi, Vietnam, where he\u2019s been hiding out at a friend\u2019s house and dodging most media requests.

He plans to release one of the games this month.\n\nThe entire story is worth a read if you\u2019re obsessed with Flappy Bird and were baffled by its sudden disappearance from the iOS App Store and Google Play. Here\u2019s one more snippet, which explains how Nguyen took a previous game, Shuriken Block, and stripped the idea down further so players didn\u2019t have to look at where they tapped on the screen.\n\nHe modeled the game on one of the most masocore analog creations ever: paddleball. The toy was a simple design \u2013 just a wooden paddle with a string attached to a rubber ball. But players would be lucky to bounce the ball more than a few times in a row. Like paddleball, he limited his game to just a couple of elements \u2013 the bird and the pipes \u2013 and resisted the usual urge to lard the action with new elements as the player progressed. He tuned the physics so that the bird was fighting gravity so strong, even the slightest wrong tap would kill it.\n\nNguyen didn\u2019t just accidentally make a brilliant game. He iterated until he had something that deserved its viral success.\n\nMORE: The History of Video Game Consoles \u2013 Full\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "526": "Flappy Bird has already become one of the biggest stories of 2014, vanishing from app stores almost as fast as its meteoric rise in popularity.

While Nguyen isn't getting any new downloads of the game, it's safe to say that he's still pulling in a fair amount of money from players who continue to chase that elusive high score.

To make things simple to understand, he doesn\u2019t want people going crazy over playing a simple, yet very aggravating game.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe people were actually losing their sh*t while playing Flappy Bird, Dong has been very open about the death threats that he received while the game was still live for people to download. It may seem like a very trivial game, but people take that flapping avian creature very seriously.\n\nIn the event that the game comes back, will you fall victim once again to its mesmerizing spell?", "529": "Flappy Bird developer considers reissue with disclaimer\n\nIn his home town of Hanoi, Vietnam, Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen has this week suggested that he may \u2013 possibly \u2013 bring the app back from the dead. While there are tens of (if not a hundred, at this point) Flappy Bird replacement apps out in the wild, this creator of the heavily addicting game hasn\u2019t (until now) suggested he\u2019d be doing anything other than keeping the app off the store for good. It was, after all, a takedown born of angst and woe.\n\nNguyen suggests that he\u2019s happy with his life now as he speaks with Rolling Stone editor David Kushner, and developing apps other than Flappy Bird could be enough for him for the future. Even if they don\u2019t take on the same popularity as his most massive title, Nguyen suggests his future apps are good enough for him.\n\nWhile he\u2019s working on three apps at the moment, the possibility of releasing Flappy Bird again has come up with Nguyen \u2013 even if it\u2019s just in passing. With Checkonaut, Kitty Jetpack, and a game without a name made to be a cowboy-themed shooter all in the works, Nguyen still has Flappy Bird on his mind.\n\nThough he\u2019s been offered cash from more than one source already, Nguyen says he\u2019ll never sell Flappy Bird. Instead, he says, \u201cI can\u2019t go back to my life before, but I\u2019m good now.\u201d Speaking also on how it felt to take the game down from app stores for Android and Apple devices, he simply said that he felt \u201crelief.\u201d\n\nAs for a reissue of Flappy Bird, Nguyen said \u201cI\u2019m considering it.\u201d He went on to say that if the game ever did come back, it\u2019s have a \u201cwarning\u201d that simply states \u201cPlease take a break.\u201d", "530": "The maker of axed smash hit mobile game Flappy Bird has hinted the addictive title could one day return to the App Store, following the self-imposed exile.\n\nDeveloper Dong Nguyen removed the game last month, seemingly overwhelmed by media attention, accusations of Mario thievery and even guilt over how much time users were spending playing it.\n\nAt the time, Nguyen claimed to \"hate\" the game that had \"ruined his simple life,\" but in an extensive interview with Rolling Stone, he admitted to pondering its eventual return to the nest.\n\n\"I'm considering it,\" he told the magazine, before adding that any return would come with a \"warning [to] take a break!\"\n\nAddictive-yet-infuriating\n\nSince Flappy Bird went into hibernation, iOS devices with the game installed have appeared on eBay for thousands and many clones have emerged seeking to replicate the addictive-yet-infuriating experience.\n\nThose fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to possess the game are still generating massive wads of cash for the Vietnamese developer who was reportedly bringing tens of thousands in ad revenue during the game's peak.\n\nAs a result, Nguyen has quit his day job to focus on full time developing. He's got an untitled cowboy shooter, a vertical flying game called Kitty Jetpack and an \"action chess game\" called Checkonaught coming this month.\n\nAll of the games will feature those 8-bit inspired graphics combined with extreme levels of difficulty, according to the interview.

He added that if he decides to post the game a second time, it will come with a \u201cwarning\u201d to users, telling them \u201cplease take a break.\u201d\n\nNguyen\u2019s original \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d was published by Vietnam-based Gears Studio last May. By November 2013, the title placed 1,368 on U.S. game charts. A month later, the game placed in the top 250 for free apps in the U.S. In January 2014, \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d ranked as the eighth most downloaded free app in the U.S.\n\nIn February, the title was being downloaded 2 million to 3 million times per day and pulling in $50,000 in ad revenue daily in Google Play and Apple iOS stores.\n\nAs the game grew in popularity, criticism of \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d began to gain traction. Many people accused it of being too similar to 1985\u2019s \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d Kotaku even called the mobile game \u201cplagiarism\u201d and \u201cripped art.\u201d Another blogger questioned whether the massive success of \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d was due to the use of bots, or fake accounts, run by computers to falsely create downloads or reviews. \u201cLooking at some of the top apps in the store by Nguyen, I hate to say it, but it looks really similar to bot activity,\u201d Carter Thomas, of online marketing company Bluecloud Solutions, said in a blog post earlier this month.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Nguyen removed the game, citing all the amount of criticism and negative press it was receiving. \u201cI am sorry, 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore,\u201d Nguyen tweeted. He also denied that he was asked to remove the app by Nintendo, a speculation made by many gaming sites. \u201cIt is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it anymore,\u201d he posted on Feb. 8.\n\nSince its deletion, knockoffs of the title are appearing everywhere. Earlier this month, it was reported that 60 \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d knockoffs were being added to Apple\u2019s App store every day, averaging to about one game every 24 minutes. \u201cFlying Cyrus\u201d and \u201cPugo\u201d were among the more successful knockoffs, but hundreds of \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d-like games continue to flood Android and iPhone app stores.

Nevertheless, people all around the world were taken to it, and some were actually sad to see the game go. In a feature interview with Rolling Stone, Flappy Bird developer Dong Nguyen says that he is \u201cconsidering\u201d bringing back the infamous title.\n\nWhen he initially pulled the game, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why he had done that to a title reportedly netting him $50,000 per day in ad revenues. Some thought he may have been threatened by the possibility of legal action by Nintendo, but Nguyen came out saying that the game\u2019s addictive quality made him pull it. He tells Rolling Stone that if Flappy Bird is to flap its way back onto our devices, a warning will be attached to it telling players to take a break.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t go beyond that, so unfortunately there\u2019s no release date to mark our calendars with.

He wanted it to be simple but challenging, in the spirit of the Nintendo games he grew up playing. The object was to fly a bug-eyed, big-lipped, bloated bird between a series of green vertical pipes. The quicker a player tapped the screen, the higher the bird would flap. He called it Flappy Bird.\n\nGame Never Over: 10 Most Addictive Video Games\n\nThe game went live on the iOS App Store on May 24th. Instead of charging for Flappy Bird, Nguyen made it available for free, and hoped to get a few hundred dollars a month from in-game ads.\n\nBut with about 25,000 new apps going online every month, Flappy Bird was lost in the mix and seemed like a bust \u2013 until, eight months later, something crazy happened. The game went viral. By February, it was topping the charts in more than 100 countries and had been downloaded more than 50 million times. Nguyen was earning an estimated $50,000 a day. Not even Mark Zuckerberg became rich so fast.\n\nYet as Flappymania peaked, Nguyen remained a mystery. Aside from the occasional tweet, he had little to say about his incredible story. He ducked the press and refused to be photographed. He was called a fraud, a con man and a thief. Bloggers accused him of stealing art from Nintendo. The popular gaming site Kotaku wrote in a widely clicked headline, FLAPPY BIRD IS MAKING $50,000 A DAY OFF RIPPED ART.\n\nOn February 9th, at 2:02 a.m. Hanoi time, a message appeared on Nguyen\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cI am sorry \u2018Flappy Bird\u2019 users,\u201d it read. \u201c22 hours from now, I will take \u2018Flappy Bird\u2019 down. I cannot take this anymore.\u201d The message was retweeted more than 145,000 times by the disbelieving masses. How could someone who hit the online jackpot suddenly pull the plug? But when the clock struck midnight the next evening, the story came to an end. Nguyen, as promised, took Flappy Bird offline. In his wake, he left millions of jilted gamers, and one big question: Who was this dude, and WTF had he done?\n\nWatch David Kushner reveal how he landed his Flappy Bird exclusive in the video below:\n\n\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nTwo weeks after the demise of Flappy, I\u2019m taxiing past pagodas and motorbikes to the outskirts of Hanoi, a crowded, rundown metropolis filled with street vendors selling pirated goods, to meet with Nguyen, who has agreed to share with Rolling Stone his whole story for the first time. With the international press and local paparazzi searching for him, Nguyen has been in hiding \u2013 fleeing his parents\u2019 house to stay at a friend\u2019s apartment, where he now remains. Although dot-com millionaires have become familiar in the U.S., in Vietnam\u2019s fledgling tech community they\u2019re all but unheard of. When the country\u2019s first celebrity geek, a boyish, slight guy in jeans and a gray sweater, walks hesitantly up and introduces himself, he measures his words and thoughts carefully, like placing pixels on a screen. \u201cI was just making something fun to share with other people,\u201d he says with the help of a translator. \u201cI couldn\u2019t predict the success of Flappy Bird.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Van Phuc, a village outside Hanoi famous for silk-making, Nguyen (pronounced nwin) never imagined being a world-famous game designer. Though his father owned a hardware store and his mother worked for the government, his family couldn\u2019t afford Game Boys for him or his younger brother. But eventually, they were able to purchase a Nintendo, which, like most electronics in Vietnam, was available only in cloned form. Marveling at the power of controlling a character onscreen, Nguyen spent his free time obsessively playing Super Mario Bros.\n\nBy 16, Nguyen had learned to code his own computer chess game. Three years later, while studying computer science at a university in Hanoi, he placed in the top 20 of a programming competition and got an internship with one of Hanoi\u2019s only game companies at the time, Punch Entertainment, which made cellphone games. Son Bui Truong, Nguyen\u2019s former boss, says the young programmer stood out for his speed, skills and fierce independent streak. \u201cDong didn\u2019t need a supervisor,\u201d Truong says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. So we said he did not have to report to anyone.\u201d\n\nNguyen soon tired of churning out the company\u2019s sports games. When he later got his hands on an iPhone, he became fascinated by the possibilities of the touch screen. Few games, however, captured the simple power of the Nintendo games of his youth. Angry Birds was too busy, he thought. \u201cI don\u2019t like the graphics,\u201d he says. \u201cIt looked too crowded.\u201d Nguyen wanted to make games for people like himself: busy, harried, always on the move. \u201cI pictured how people play,\u201d he says, as he taps his iPhone and reaches his other hand in the air. \u201cOne hand holding the train strap.\u201d He\u2019d make a game for them.\n\nAs we talk into the night, hordes of agile pedestrians deftly dodge the Hanoi traffic, screens flickering in their hands like fireflies. It\u2019s no wonder the world\u2019s hottest game came from here. \u201cWhen you play game on a smartphone,\u201d he says, with an ever-present cigarette dangling from his lip, \u201cthe simplest way is just tapping.\u201d\n\nLast April, Nguyen was tapping his iPhone at home while the rest of Hanoi was celebrating Reunification Day, the annual holiday marking the end of the Vietnam War. Instead of joining the throngs outside, he spent the weekend in his bedroom at his parents\u2019 house creating a little game for fun, as a poster he\u2019d drawn of Mario gazed down on him.\n\nFall Out Boy Pay Homage to \u2018Flappy Bird\u2019 With \u2018Fall Out Bird\u2019\n\nNguyen had already made and released a mobile game, Shuriken Block, earlier that month. The object was to stop a cascade of ninja stars from impaling five little men on the screen. This seemed simple enough \u2013 the one-word instruction read TAP. Tap the falling star at the right moment, and it would bounce away. But Nguyen understood the mantra of game design that Nolan Bushnell, creator of Pong and founder of Atari, described as \u201ceasy to learn and difficult to master.\u201d More recently, indie game makers had taken this to speed-metal extremes with the so-called masocore genre \u2013 games that are masochistically hard. Shuriken Block was deceptively ruthless. Even the nimblest player would have trouble lasting a minute before the men were spurting pixelated blood. Nguyen was pleased with the results, but the game languished in the iOS store.\n\nFor his new game, Nguyen realized a way to go even simpler: Let the player tap anywhere. All he needed was an idea to build it around. The year before, he\u2019d drawn a pixelated bird on his computer that riffed on Nintendo fish, called Cheep Cheeps. He drew green pipes \u2013 a homage to Super Mario Bros. \u2013 that the bird would have to navigate. He modeled the game on one of the most masocore analog creations ever: paddleball. The toy was a simple design \u2013 just a wooden paddle with a string attached to a rubber ball. But players would be lucky to bounce the ball more than a few times in a row.\n\nLike paddleball, he limited his game to just a couple of elements \u2013 the bird and the pipes \u2013 and resisted the usual urge to lard the action with new elements as the player progressed. He tuned the physics so that the bird was fighting gravity so strong, even the slightest wrong tap would kill it. Since the deaths would be so frequent, Nguyen wanted to make them entertaining. He tried having the bird explode in a bloody pulp, or bounce back across the ground, before settling on a faceplant. He then sifted through hundreds of sounds before settling on a kung-fu-style thwack to make the bird\u2019s demise even funnier. (The first question he asks me about the game is if it made me laugh.) \u201cThe bird is flying along peacefully,\u201d he says with a chuckle, \u201cand all of a sudden you die!\u201d\n\nBefore the last flag waved on Reunification Day, Nguyen had gone on Twitter and posted a screen shot of his \u201cnew simple game.\u201d Other than a couple of tweets, Nguyen says he put no marketing behind the launch. And, like so many games released into the flood, Flappy Bird flopped. The first mention of the game on Twitter didn\u2019t come until five months later, on November 4th, when someone posted a three-word review. \u201cFuck Flappy Bird,\u201d it read.\n\nTrying to divine why stuff goes viral is like trying to fly the bird: You end up ass-up on the ground. But \u201cFuck Flappy Bird\u201d captured the essence of the appeal. The highly addictive Flappy Bird was like a snot-nosed kid paddleballing you in the face. It was begging to be spanked. And you couldn\u2019t resist or stop playing.\n\nBy the end of December, players swarmed social media to commiserate, compete and bitch about breaking their phones in frustration. Twitter erupted with Flappy Bird testimonials, eventually hitting more than 16 million messages. One called it \u201cthe most annoying game yet I can\u2019t stop,\u201d and another said it was \u201cslowly consuming my life.\u201d As word spread from Reddit to YouTube, playgrounds to office parks, Flappy Bird rose to the Top 10 of the U.S. charts by early January. Finally, with no promotion, no plan, no logic, on January 17th, Flappy Bird hit Number One. A week or two later, it topped the Google Play store, too.\n\n\u201cSeeing the game on top, I felt amazing,\u201d Nguyen recalls. Like everyone else, he was shocked by its meteoric rise \u2013 and the avalanche of money that would be wired into his bank account. Even with Apple and Google\u2019s 30 percent take, Nguyen estimated he was clearing $50,000 a day. Before long, Shuriken Block and a new game he had submitted called Super Ball Juggling joined Flappy Bird in the Top 10. But other than buying a new Mac, and taking his buddies out for rice wine and chicken hot pot, Nguyen wasn\u2019t much for indulging. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be too happy,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d Remarkably, he hadn\u2019t yet even bothered to tell his parents, with whom he lived. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t understand games,\u201d he explains.\n\nAs news hit of how much money Nguyen was making, his face appeared in the Vietnamese papers and on TV, which was how his mom and dad first learned their son had made the game. The local paparazzi soon besieged his parents\u2019 house, and he couldn\u2019t go out unnoticed. While this might seem a small price to pay for such fame and fortune, for Nguyen the attention felt suffocating. \u201cIt is something I never want,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPlease give me peace.\u201d\n\nBut the hardest thing of all, he says, was something else entirely. He hands me his iPhone so that I can scroll through some messages he\u2019s saved. One is from a woman chastising him for \u201cdistracting the children of the world.\u201d Another laments that \u201c13 kids at my school broke their phones because of your game, and they still play it cause it\u2019s addicting like crack.\u201d Nguyen tells me of e-mails from workers who had lost their jobs, a mother who had stopped talking to her kids. \u201cAt first I thought they were just joking,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I realize they really hurt themselves.\u201d Nguyen \u2013 who says he botched tests in high school because he was playing too much Counter-Strike \u2013 genuinely took them to heart.\n\nBy early February, the weight of everything \u2013 the scrutiny, the relentless criticism and accusations \u2013 felt crushing. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t focus, didn\u2019t want to go outdoors. His parents, he says, \u201cworried about my well-being.\u201d His tweets became darker and more cryptic. \u201cI can call \u2018Flappy Bird\u2019 is a success of mine,\u201d read one. \u201cBut it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it.\u201d He realized there was one thing to do: Pull the game. After tweeting that he was taking it down, 10 million people downloaded it in 22 hours. Then he hit a button, and Flappy Bird disappeared. When I ask him why he did it, he answers with the same conviction that led him to create the game. \u201cI\u2019m master of my own fate,\u201d he says. \u201cIndependent thinker.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Flappy Bird\u2019s demise, rumors spread. Nguyen had committed suicide. Nintendo was suing him. He\u2019d received death threats. His refusal to speak fueled the speculation even more. To fill the massive hole left by Flappy Bird, imitators rushed to cash in. By the time I visit, the top three free iPhone apps are Flappy rip-offs \u2013 Flappy Wings, Splashy Fish, even a game based on Miley Cyrus. As of this writing, a Drake game called Tiny Flying Drizzy is Number One at the App Store, and, according to a study, a new Flappy clone pops up every 24 minutes. \u201cPeople can clone the app because of its simplicity,\u201d Nguyen says, \u201cbut they will never make another Flappy Bird.\u201d Indeed, for those who crave the real thing, phones with Flappy Bird installed have been listed for thousands on eBay.\n\nBut the absence has also spawned a reappraisal. Kotaku apologized for its allegations of plagiarism. John Romero, co-creator of the game Doom, says Flappy Bird is \u201ca reaction against prevailing design the way grunge was a reaction to metal.\u201d The godfather of gaming, Bushnell, compares it to his own hit, Pong. \u201cSimple games are more satisfying,\u201d he says.\n\nAs for Nguyen, the millions of people who downloaded Flappy Bird are still generating tens of thousands of dollars for him. He\u2019s finally quit his job and says he\u2019s thinking of buying a Mini Cooper and an apartment. He just got his first passport. For now, though, he\u2019s busy doing what he loves most: making games. Over tea, he shows me the three he\u2019s working on simultaneously: an untitled cowboy-themed shooter, a vertical flying game called Kitty Jetpack and an \u201caction chess game,\u201d as he puts it, called Checkonaut, one of which he\u2019ll release this month. Each sports his now-familiar style: simple play, retro graphics and hardcore difficulty.\n\nSince taking Flappy Bird down, he says he\u2019s felt \u201crelief. I can\u2019t go back to my life before, but I\u2019m good now.\u201d As for the future of his flapper, he\u2019s still turning down offers to purchase the game. Nguyen refuses to compromise his independence. But will Flappy Bird ever fly again? \u201cI\u2019m considering it,\u201d Nguyen says. He\u2019s not working on a new version, but if he ever releases one it will come with a \u201cwarning,\u201d he says: \u201cPlease take a break.\u201d\n\nThis story is from the March 27th, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone.", "539": "The game which closed down this year, Flappy Bird is a disruptive mobile game for Android users. An Online Gamification service articulated with quality is important. Organizations should address Online Gamification honestly. Online Gamification requires the correct budgets. The process of Online Gamification limiting quality and scope of work to be done for price will not serve in best interest. With the right strategy and implementation to achieve the correct engagement results this is possible.\n\nPlaying Flappy Bird Is Easier On Android. The Android app is highly popular which was created by developer Dong Nguyen. With more than 250,000 four-star reviews, \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d is easier on Android than the iOS stated Nguyen. Flappy Bird is rapidly building its reputation against Android users as being an addicting game. The frustration comes in that this game is described as fun, annoying, strategic and addictive all at the same time.\n\nU.S. revenue from sales of mobile games and those downloaded to computers rose 16 percent last year, to $5.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group. Sales of the standard $60 packaged titles for consoles fell 21 percent, to $8.9 billion. In the next 5 years mobile games are expected to grow. Markets such as China have been key growth areas.\n\nOnline spending will increase by an average of 8% per year over the next five years. By 2017, the online platform will have almost reached parity with consoles; and US$97 will be spent on online games for every US$100 spent on console games according to PWC.\n\nThere are concerns in the management area. The lack of management knowing of modern techniques can cause issues. The workforce can be engaged yet distracted with games alone. The modern loyalty and gamification measures require an update to address the digital lives of customers and employees. Even if gamification engagement is effective with the workforce, engagement should be the outcome of the set objectives.\n\nThe merging of TVs and gaming is changing. \"There should be over 150 million online console gamers globally by 2017 as well, so the opportunity to sell these gaming enthusiasts digital assets through Wii U, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 consoles will be substantially larger than it is today,\" \"The number of Web-connected consoles should top 200 million worldwide by 2017, making these appliances a key on-ramp for not only big budget and indie games but a wide variety of multimedia and social applications and services,\" stated Lewis Ward, IDC Research Manager.\n\nAre you ready for madness? The Android app is available for free download at Google Play\u2019s store. The game has held the top spot on Google App in the last week of January. The developer of Flappy Bird states that the sudden growth has been all organic. The top reviews on Google Play have been received well.", "540": "Over the weekend, a new Rs. 55 game launched on the iTunes App Store - Flabby Bird HD. After the meteoric rise - and sudden end - of Flappy Bird, what started off as a single, flawed game quickly became an entire genre.\n\nCritics did not like the game but the public certainly did and developer Dong Nguyen said he was earning up to $50,000 per day via in-app ads. In less than a month though, Nguyen took the game down, saying, \"I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore... It is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it any more... I also don't sell 'Flappy Bird', please don't ask... And I still make games.\" He later stated that the game was \"too addictive.\"\n\nWith the game gone, it wasn't a surprise that others rushed to clone it and make a quick buck. Flabby Bird HD has the following description on the App Store: \"Want to know the real reason why the original flapping sensation retired from aviation? Because it's become FATTY and FLABBY from eating too much CHOCOLATE! And overfed, overweight and overconfident rendition of the popular aviator returns!\"\n\nThat description might make you think there's some connection with Nguyen's game, but that's not the case. Flabby Bird was in fact released by a company called Memoriki, which has mostly made a quiz app in multiple languages.\n\nWhile the cloners kept building apps and trying to make a fast buck though, something very interesting happened as well. Developers around the world closed ranks to offer support to Nguyen who claimed he was suffering intense stress ever since Flappy Bird became a hit. The result was a movement called Flappy Jam where game developers could submit free Flappy Bird-inspired apps to show their support for Nguyen.\n\nAt the same time as the launch of Flabby Bird HD, Flappy Jam also came to a close, with just about 800 entries. Most of these games are the polar opposite of the clones flooding mobile app stores.\n\nSome of the biggest names in the mobile game space participated, including Terry Cavanagh, who is most famous for his game Super Hexagon, and also Adam Saltsman, the creator of the runaway hit Canabalt. Some of the ideas are really unexpected, like a text adventure game. Others are simple reskins. But we tried out the various entries, which are available here and found some favourites.\n\nTerry Cavanagh's Maverick Bird is both obviously a riff on Flappy Bird, and also completely unique. Using Cavanagh's typical style in art and music, the gameplay is almost the same as Flappy Bird, but Cavanagh added a dive button which reworks the mechanics dramatically. Flappy Bird was a game about careful timing, but thanks to the music, the neon colours and the dive button, Maverick Bird is frenzied and gets your pulse racing.\n\nFlappybalt by Adam Saltsman also bears its creator's signature style, and changes the rules to create something unusual without changing the formula much. You still flap around in the same way before, but now you're flapping in a small room with spikes on the walls that you have to avoid. The grey background and art are from Canabalt, and all that's missing is the music of that game.\n\nOh My Gravity is another great game, with stark art that stands out from the crowd. Gravity (the movie) would've been a lot shorter if surviving it was as hard as this game, but it would still have been captivating, that's certain.\n\nThere's even a version of Flappy Bird which has been recreated with a first person view for using with an Oculus Rift so players will be able to experience the joy of bouncing headfirst into a pipe repeatedly.\n\n\n\nWhat these games prove is that great art can come from simple ideas. And that we - the customers - should show our support to artists trying to make something new, instead of the 50th clone of a game which doesn't go beyond changing the look of things minimally.", "541": "It started with one little bird that drove the world crazy, but ever since Flappy Bird was removed from the app stores, many have rushed to take its place.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Flappy Bird is a simple game with simple objectives \u2013 dodge the obstacles and beat your high score. However, it was notoriously difficult and many found it impossible to reach double digits.\n\nThe game was also highly addictive and created a huge fan following constantly herding to Twitter to post their high scores. It was also immensely popular as it was downloaded a total of 50 million times from both app stores.\n\nThis infamous game generated over $40,000 a day on advertisement revenue and for those who weren\u2019t already hooked, the buzz the game generated was loud enough to see for themselves.\n\nFlappy Bird had a simple 8-bit interface and the design closely resembled that of Super Mario, but why was such a straightforward game so popular?\n\nThe Flappy Factor\n\nAt first glance the game seemed simple, even boring, but once you started the game the challenge was to beat your own score. No luck is needed, there are no bonuses to collect and the rules do not change \u2013 that was what made it so addictive.\n\nThe game was so simple that it required players to add meaning to it and thereby rewarding themselves upon beating their own high scores. The game simply employed a \u2018cause and effect\u2019 method of gaming and if the user lost the round, they only had themselves to blame \u2013 and no one enjoys being a loser.\n\nA New Member of the Flappy Family\n\nSince Flappy Bird was taken off the app stores by its creator many have rushed to create similar games. Fast Effects Studios has created a brand new game that promises to hold the same appeal as the original.\n\nFlappy Bat is not unlike the archetype in the sense that the game-play is extremely addictive. The style of graphics is also similar however for those who want a refreshing change in the game scenario, bats only come out at night.\n\nGet your Flappy Bat to fly through the graveyard in the middle of the night to beat your own high score. Once you have done that, post your score to Twitter and you might win an iPhone 5 from the game developers.\n\nThe team at Fast Effects Studios are not strangers to creating addictive games. Their website lists a total of 10 games you can download, from a variety of categories such as racing, word and strategy \u2013 all of which are completely free.", "542": "Flappy Bird is no longer just a two-dimensional sprite. It\u2019s now a plush toy that you can use to play the hit mobile game that disappeared from app stores last month.\n\nZowPow, the winner of GamesBeat 2013\u2019s Who\u2019s Got Game competition last October, is starting a crowdfunding project to get its own version of Dong Nguyen\u2019s mobile hit Flappy Bird on iOS and Android devices. In ZowPow\u2019s game (the app itself is free), Flappy Toy, players lift up a wireless, battery-powered plush replica of Flappy Bird\u2019s main character to control him onscreen. Moving him up and down in a flapping motion navigates him safely through an endless series of green pipes. That\u2019s one way to circumvent the tricky touchscreen controls that frustrated so many players.\n\nFlappy is still challenging, though, so ZowPow has designed the toy so you can take your frustrations out on it. It won\u2019t break even if you throw it.\n\nImage Credit: ZowPow\n\n\u201cMy co-founder, Brian, and I are huge fans of Flappy Bird, so we decided to use our technology to make a wireless toy controller for the game,\u201d ZowPow\u2019s Jennifer Lu told GamesBeat. \u201cWe showed it to our friends and also to random people on the street. Everyone loved it and wanted one. So we figured we\u2019d create a crowdfunding campaign to make it available to everyone and sell it pretty much at cost, for $15.\u201d\n\nZowPow is asking for $25,000 in crowdfunding to make Flappy Toy happen. The campaign, which is available on the company\u2019s website, runs until April 8.\n\nOriginal Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen pulled the game from the iOS and Android app stores in February because it was too \u201caddictive.\u201d Nguyen was making about $50,000 a day in ad revenue from Flappy Bird, so it\u2019s not a surprise that another developer would want to cash in on that success while Flappy Bird fever is still hot. Since its removal, a number of mobile-game clones have appeared in its place.\n\nIn regard to potential legal ramifications, Lu said that ZowPow\u2019s version will be slightly different from the original Flappy Bird game. It\u2019s also making its SDK available to other developers so they can make their Flappy Bird-like clones work with the plush controller as well if they wish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really concerned,\u201d said Lu. \u201cThe changes are significant enough. We\u2019re really doing this for fun.\u201d\n\nIf crowdfunded, the company hopes to ship Flappy Toy in May.", "543": "Share. Or, why \"hard fun\" is a valid design choice. Or, why \"hard fun\" is a valid design choice.\n\nNews of Flappy Bird\u2019s existence first came to me via a series of wry high-score tweets: 3 ... 7 ... 2. Players reaching double figures were accused of harnessing occult forces. Naturally I was intrigued, though it was a curiosity tempered by the fact I had no idea how the score was calculated or what it meant, and by my disappointment in other \u201chard fun\u201d games like Super Meat Boy and QWOP. Especially QWOP.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I read reports of the little two meg brain-boiler raking in fifty thousand clams a day in advertising revenue that I decided to check it out. It appealed to my sense of humour: an unplayable game making millions. Though, after a few minutes of abortive tapping, I adjusted my smirk into a wry smile and hit the home key, satisfied that I was across the curio du jour; that there was nothing more to see.\n\nAnd in a literal sense, there wasn\u2019t - as far as I know. I\u2019ve heard rumours of cake, but haven\u2019t come across any. Just pipes. A solar cycle. A palette of plumage. Nonetheless, I went back for more; improved a little; hit double figures. And with a good hour of flapping under my belt, I realised that there was more to Flappy than meets the eye.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the eponymous Flappy Bird is a rotund, Groening-esque cartoon avianoid which ascends when you tap the screen, and drops like a stone once its skyward momentum is exhausted (a heartbeat later). This jaunty, parabolic style must be used to guide it between gaps in lengths of some rather familiar green plumbing. Tap too early and you\u2019ll hit a stalacpipe - leave it too late and you\u2019ll eat iron. About as simple as it gets, yet through such simplicity, Flappy dangles a tasty carrot before our gaming snouts: a tiny margin for error combined with skill-based reward.\n\nThere\u2019s no luck in Flappy Bird, good or bad; variance, sure, but no unavoidable bullets plugging us, or being in the right place at the right time. And the controls are tight. Essentially, the game presents a straightforward challenge, equips us with the ability to meet it, teaches us how to use it via an arcade infographic, and leaves us to suffer - something we\u2019re happy to do given the clarity of our objective (a new high score), and the fact that success or failure is just a few seconds away.\n\nThe beauty of such simple yet functionally devious gameplay is that it requires the player to invest it with meaning. It\u2019s akin to the cushioned shoes which allowed us to start running marathons, or the crampons which enabled us to ascend the highest peaks - the point of such activities being the achievement of something uncommonly difficult; to provide answers to questions of fortitude. Flappy Bird is about taking the next step and the next step and the one after that, towards an ever rising summit. One step is simple, but a hundred? In essence, it\u2019s about not slipping up. And when we do, the whip-crack sound effect accompanies the knowledge that we only have ourselves to blame.\n\nAs I sank deeper into the Flappy-hole, I realised that the game wasn\u2019t merely a successful testing chamber, but an affectionate and witty homage to platform games - not merely in terms of the pixel-grazing tension, but by way of the sentimental bond established between player and character.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nThe overall Super Mario World look is more than a superficial reference to the moustachioed one. It\u2019s a reminder of the time that being hopelessly underpowered and inelegant was par for the course. It\u2019s no surprise that our yen for balletic carnage has been indulged as technology has progressed, but playing gods of war is only one type of role, with its own limitations - a design which privileges the flow of cinematic action over progress-sapping breaks, for instance.\n\nMario sits at the other end of the spectrum. He\u2019s slow, feeble, jumps like a cricket after a dose of Raid, wields fireballs in a largely incombustible world, and flies like a six year-old\u2019s kite. Yet we love him in spite of his flaws. Or, more to the point, because of them. Every video game is a complex world of cause and effect, and Nintendo propped up its corner of the big top with a stable of characters who needed to be guided toward their goal with tactical thought and surgical precision, rather than launched there in the wake of singing blades and hot lead.\n\nThe typical Nintendo protagonist brings to mind the \u201cdefective detective\u201d of hardboiled fiction. From Sherlock Holmes to Lisbeth Salander, the genre has romanticised the socially inept, physically hampered, and emotionally scarred as having gained from their failure to meet mainstream expectations - at least insofar as detective work goes - its mass appeal founded on the fact that being vulnerable to a dangerous world which seeks to oppress the truth is a scenario which everyone can relate to, even if the dangers we face usually aren\u2019t mortal ones.\n\nAs a character, Flappy Bird\u2019s look and movement might appear to have been intended as the proverbial red rag to a bull, but if frustration and anger were all anyone felt, the game would never have cemented its place in pop culture. Aside from the game as a phenomenon, however, its intentionally clumsy, unforgiving nature provides nostalgic insight into a couple of the core elements of old school gaming: the powerful lure of an unambiguous test, and the sympathetic quality of characters who don\u2019t appear to be equal to the task.\n\nWhat I love about Flappy Bird is that there\u2019s nowhere to hide. The sole aim is survival, moment to moment, for the duration of each game. Every obstacle presents the opportunity to better your score by an increment of one, or fail completely. I think it\u2019s fair to say that as games have become more sophisticated - more like cinematic role-playing than circumscribed trials - these straightforward do-or-die stakes have been pushed to the margins. As a consequence, a genuinely difficult game caused a sensation, much in the same way that Flappy\u2019s big-budget cousins, Demon's Souls and Dark Souls have. The tales are woe are strikingly familiar: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. Absurd. I can\u2019t put it down.\u201d\n\nGiven the success of such games, large and small, I wonder whether gruelling difficulty is back on the menu. Flappy Bird\u2019s creator withdrew the game from the marketplace because he felt that it wasn\u2019t being played in the spirit he intended. It was an \u201caddictive product,\u201d rather than something to wind-down with at the end of the day - which, control freak-out aside, is really to ignore the contribution resistance makes to enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nIf Flappy Bird had been slightly easier, no one would have even played it, let alone wound-down with it - well, no one over eight, anyway. The irritation and obsession expressed by the gaming public were part and parcel of a successful exchange between a designer and his players. Flappy Bird\u2019s difficulty made it something we could really sink our teeth into - an aspect of gaming which has been overlooked in favour of content; difficulty being stigmatised as inhibiting play and exploration, and therefore the overall commercial viability of a game.\n\nI can understand the anxiety, but it\u2019s a simplistic way of thinking about it. The challenge a game presents can become as much a part of its DNA as its story and art direction; another tool that developers can use to make gameplay engaging and rewarding. While a difficulty slider makes sense for a lot of reasons, its drawback is that it prevents a game from having inherent challenge, voiding it as a defining characteristic. On the other hand, games which present a resolute and unavoidable challenge - all things being equal - inspire such dedication and excitement precisely because achievement isn\u2019t a grey area. If Everest could be climbed on Medium, it just wouldn\u2019t have the same meaning.\n\nClearly, difficulty levels have been made more flexible over the years, not only for commercial reasons, but to suit the design of new gaming paradigms. However, when you consider that, on average, around 80-90% of players don\u2019t finish games - including marquee titles - they don\u2019t seem to have a positive effect on motivation. I wonder whether, in fact, they\u2019ve had the opposite effect. That in a quest to provide access to their creative vistas, game designers have lost sight of them as signifiers of achievement; that by installing escalators on Everest, they\u2019ve dulled the point of climbing it in the first place. I can Google the view from the summit. But I can\u2019t download the experience of being there.\n\nDaniel Clark is an Australian freelance gaming journalist and writer. Why not follow him on IGN and join the IGN Australia Facebook community? And if you liked Flappy Bird, why not check out the hundreds of games created as part of the Flappy Jam?", "544": "I have a couple legal copies of Frozen in my home\u2026 and I don\u2019t even have a daughter. But this morning, Time magazine (basically stealing a story reported by TorrentFreak) featured a web-based program (not an \u201capp\u201d in the traditional sense, as it is not available on wireless platforms via Apple, Google or whomever) called Popcorn Time. I won\u2019t link to it, but it isn\u2019t hard to find. Still, I feel compelled to write about it, as it is an open-source, free program that simplifies the theft of filmed content for pretty much anyone.\n\nAnd within 5 minutes of reading about this thing, via Time magazine, was illegally watching Frozen in perfect HD form.\n\nThe content\u2026 what is and isn\u2019t there\u2026 is interesting. According to the TorrentFreak story, the feed to Popcorn Time is from a site called YTS and searching that site, it seems that the only 2014 movies are direct-to-dvd releases. In fact, it appears that everything there is already on DVD or about to go onto DVD. The post-theatrical market is the one being attacked in this case, not really theatrical.\n\nAmerican Hustle won\u2019t be released on DVD until next week and it is available. But all the December movies from major studios that are torrents streaming on the website (give or take a week) are movies already out on DVD. No Wolf, no Philomena, no Her, amongst Oscar nominees. No Hobbit 2, no Walter Mitty, no Anchorman 2, no Lone Survivor, etc.\n\nA little research turned up that the top source of early releases are leaks within DVD production houses, so the films available, it seems, are those within a few weeks of \u2013 or in \u2013 DVD release. Did the interest in films that were videotaped off movie theater screens, or \u201ccams,\u201d end? Did tracking mechanisms on theatrical prints end the practice?\n\nSeeking answers, I put in a call to CreativeFuture, the new coalition of content-creating and distribution companies that has been tasked with finding solutions to piracy for the film/tv industry moving forward. The organization confirmed that films videotaped in movie theaters are still out there and an issue, but that the piracy universe is now dominated by post-theatrical theft. In other words, pristine quality, hi-def streaming that takes dollars out of DVD/Blu-ray sales & rentals, but also devalues ongoing deals with pay-TV, Netflix, and other ongoing post-theatrical revenue opportunities.\n\nThere is a notion that Popcorn Time, created by \u201cSebastian, a designer from Buenos Aires, Argentina\u201d is only offering the highest quality torrents so that they can equate themselves with Netflix\u2026 a comparison that is made in every media story I have seen. In other words, even though the site is now free and claims that it always will be free and without advertising, they are behaving like an organization staking out a place at the table. According to the Digital Citizens Alliance, \u201ccontent theft websites\u201d took in $227 million in advertising last year. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made on selling what other companies paid millions to create.\n\nIs Popcorn Time the Napster of movies? Is this the beginning of the end for copyright respect?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. And anyone who has read me much knows that I believe the industry will move to a subscription-based, everything/everywhere/on-demand future within the next decade. I don\u2019t see another way that it all works. Fifteen hundred dollars a year or so for access to pretty much everything in post-theatrical. Times 100 million households. That\u2019s $150 billion a year in revenue, before theatrical, specialty variations at a price, and other ancillaries. How it gets spread around is the question that slows the whole evolution down.\n\nBut until that happens, there will be theft. Technology, slow lawmaking, international apathy, and human nature guarantee it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it right. It doesn\u2019t make people who do it any less guilty of taking money out of the pockets not just of corporations they don\u2019t care about, but working people they should care about.

All those free movies are actually pirated copies pulled from torrent sites.\n\nStill in beta, the platform runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and promises zero advertising and an entirely free experience. But proceed at your own risk.\n\nAs the website warns, \"downloading copyrighted material may be illegal in your country,\" so just think twice about how important it is for you to watch Gravity on your computer instead of picking it up at the local Redbox.\n\nPopcorn Time doesn't actually host anything criminal, but as PCMag's sister site, Geek.com, pointed out, that didn't work out too well for The Pirate Bay.\n\nThe service temporarily downloads content to your PC, so you might find yourself violating your ISP's terms of service - and in receipt of a warning letter - depending on where you live. \"We're using torrents, so if you really care, you'd better Google what the legal situation around these protocol is where you live,\" Popcorn Time said on its website.\n\nIf you're still interested, Popcorn Time promises a consistently updated catalog. By poaching movies from \"the best torrents from the most important sites\" around the Web, the company is able to provide everything from the forgotten classics to this year's Oscar winners (and losers).\n\n\"If the movie is out there, Popcorn Time will find the best version and start streaming it right away,\" the site said.\n\nAnd if you just can't get enough of Frozen, feel free to watch it over and over until you dream in animation.

Now you don't have to, as a programmer has made a new open source free movie streaming app called Popcorn Time that streams movies directly from peer-to-peer networks.\n\nUsers of BitTorrent clients share and distribute large files over the internet, which are distributed in segments called pieces to users, who are known as \"peers\". Once a user receives every single piece of the file, they can continue to share their copy with other users as \"seeders\".\n\n\"As a designer I love the challenge of simplification. Take something hard for the common user and make it usable. I have a lot of friends who don't understand torrents and I wanted to make it easy and effortless to use torrent technology,\" the app creator from Buenos Aires, Argentina, known on the internet as Sebastian, told Torrent Freak.\n\nSebastian took only a few months to code the app and Popcorn Time offers instant access to hundreds of films, complete with subtitles and able to be streamed in a range of qualities, from 720p to full HD.\n\nOf course, all of this is illegal as Popcorn Time links to copyrighted movies, many of which haven't yet been released on iTunes or Amazon for legitimate digital movie downloads, but Sebastian and his team of 20 collaborating developers working on the Popcorn Time project on GitHub don't seem to be too concerned.\n\n\"We don't expect legal issues. We don't host anything, and none of the developers makes any money. There are no ads, no premium accounts, and no subscription fees or anything like that. It's an experiment to learn and share,\" he said.\n\n\"The technology behind the app is very simple. We consume a group of APIs, one for the torrents, another for the movie info, and another for the poster. We also have an API for the subtitles. Everything is automated, we don't host anything, but take existing information and put it together.\"\n\nThe movie industry might not see it that way, as everything Netflix has done to reduce movie piracy, Popcorn Time could very easily undo, even though the website carries a disclaimer stating that \"downloading copyrighted material may be illegal in your country\".\n\nAdd to that, BitTorrent Portal websites like The Pirate Bay and Kick Ass Torrents continue to make an average of $4.4 million (\u00a32.6m) in advertising revenue every year, according to a recent report by the Digital Citizens Alliance.\n\n\"We hate that we don't have the chance to watch some movies at home. Popcorn Time is an experiment to show that you can do something better for the users, and that you can do it with BitTorrent,\" says Sebastian.\n\nPopcorn Time is officially still in beta testing mode, but the developers have promised that the platform will continue to remain free and open source for as long as it exists.", "548": "One thing that iTunes, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have proven is that content makers can fight piracy by providing a better, easier service to paying customers. But what happens when piracy fights back with something just as convenient? A new app called Popcorn Time raises that very question. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux, Popcorn Time lets you stream the latest movies - including American Hustle, Gravity and Frozen - with just a couple clicks. The software uses BitTorrent to find and download movies, but eliminates the usual hassle of wading through sketchy torrent sites and waiting for the file to finish downloading. Basically, it's the version of Netflix that you've always wanted - and maybe have been willing to pay extra for - but that Hollywood may never allow. It's also a flagrant enabler of copyright violation, at least in the United States.\n\nIt's the perfect product for movie lovers. It has a super-simple interface, completely abstracts Torrents away, works on the three major desktop platforms, and with one click and just a few minutes of waiting, you're watching a high-quality movie streamed through BitTorrent.\n\nThe entertainment industry could have built this years ago. Except, they were too busy suing the shit out of the very people they should have been serving to realise all the technology they needed already existed. Had the entertainment industry not been the only industry in the world that is protected by a huge, special legal framework, they would have been forced to innovate much sooner - and they most likely would have built this a decade ago.", "549": "It's been called \u201cNetflix for pirates.\"\n\nPopcorn Time is a new open source app for downloading and watching movies. It's dead simple: a list of movie genres on the left and a wall full of movie posters on the right. That's it. Click a poster, and you're presented with the option to \"Watch it now.\"\n\nUnder the hood, Popcorn Time runs BitTorrent software optimized for streaming. This means almost no waiting for a download to finish; the movie starts playing immediately.\n\nThis immediacy and simplicity is by design.\n\n\"I have a lot of friends who don't understand torrents and I wanted to make it easy and effortless to use torrent technology,\" says one of the app's designers, going only by the name Sebastian, in an interview with TorrentFreak.\n\n\"It reminds me of Napster. It's so easy,\" says Gil Zvulony, a Toronto-based internet lawyer who has seen the application.\n\nIt may be easy, says Zvulony, but's it's not legal.\n\n\"Its primary use is to make copyrighted material available. It doesn't have any other use. It clearly infringes copyright according to the Canadian copyright act.\"\n\nScreenshots on the Popcorn Time website show movie posters for very old public domain movies such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), The Phantom of the Opera (1925) and The Three Stooges: Malice in the Palace (1949).\n\nBut if you actually download the software and look at what's available, it's almost exclusively pirated material, including recent Oscar nominees such as 12 Years a Slave, American Hustle, Gravity, Frozen\u2026 almost all of it copyrighted.\n\nThe Popcorn Time website carries a loud, yellow warning: \"Downloading copyrighted material may be illegal in your country. Use at your own risk.\"\n\nZvulony thinks the app's creators are playing dumb, and are aware that people will use their software to infringe copyright.\n\nPotential damages\n\nUsing Popcorn Time to download and watch movies may infringe copyright, but here in Canada, the financial risk to individuals is small. Back in 2012, Bill C-11 capped damages for non-commercial copyright infringement at $5,000.\n\n\"That's really for the worst type of case,\" explains Zvulony. Realistically, he says, \"you're looking at $100 or $200 in terms of damages awarded, which makes it extremely uneconomical for movie studios to go after individual downloaders.\"\n\nThough BitTorrent has a reputation as a \"pirate\" tool, it also has many non-infringing uses, such as the distribution of educational content for non-profit organizations. That said, piracy and copyright infringement seems to get the most attention.\n\nFor me, Popcorn Time feels significant because of how it pulls BitTorrent movie piracy from a world of sketchy torrent sites full of porn ads and scammy pop-ups into a simple, streamlined interface.\n\nFor years, services like iTunes and Netflix have been able to compete with piracy by offering the paid options in a cleaner, safer environment.\n\nWith Popcorn Time, it seems as though the bar has been raised on the pirates' side.\n\n\"It's like an arms race,\" says Zvulony. \"There's always new innovation.\"", "550": "Share\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 5\n\nUpdate by Caleb Denison 3-14-2014 \u2013 After making headlines for a couple days, Popcorn Time\u2019s creators have taken the site down. According to ARS Technica, even though the creators maintain they were within their legal rights, the site stirred up enough noise to convince them to take it down, quoting one of the creators as saying, \u201cour experiment has put us at the doors of endless debates about piracy and copyright, legal threats and the shady machinery that makes us feel in danger for doing what we love. And that\u2019s not a battle we want a place in.\u201d\n\nThe more you try to explain the world of torrents to your less tech-savvy friends, the more convoluted and unexplainable the subject becomes. Between seeds, leeches, and upload ratios, it\u2019s a hole that keeps getting deeper. It\u2019s usually best to keep it simple with something like, \u201cIt\u2019s basically like downloading a movie file \u2026 from 20 people at once.\u201d\n\nBut now those long-winded explanations and drawn-out instruction sheets are no longer necessary. Today, all one needs to avail themselves of torrented media is Popcorn Time.\n\nPopcorn Time sprung up on the Internet about a month ago, but recent coverage by TorrentFreak has placed it under the spotlight. Now the site is starting to see some healthy traffic and word of mouth advertising. Currently under development for eventual Windows, Mac OSX and Linux releases, Popcorn Time is a handy tool for seasoned film (torrent) buffs and novice cinephiles alike. After an easy software installation, one can quickly browse through a library of new and still-in-theaters films and pick one to watch in 720p or 1080p HD resolution (it\u2019s not all brand new or in-theaters stuff; we came across films as old as 1945\u2019s Notorious and 1951\u2019s Strangers on a Train).\n\nAs a quick quality test, we downloaded the software and booted up the recently-released Thor: The Dark World. Surprisingly, within 10 minutes of dialing in the Popcorn Time URL and downloading the needed software, we already had a 1080p copy of the film running beautifully (considering the quickness with which the program operates), with much of the film on the way to being entirely buffered. The movie had an impressive array of eight available subtitle language options.\n\nThe interface is extremely straightforward, with a Netflix instant queue-style quilt of film cover art popping up upon startup. The only other visual aspect is along the left-hand side \u2014 a fairly comprehensive genre list with categories ranging from Animation and Biography to Film-Noir and Fantasy, and a search field. You can probably expect some additions to the interface as the Beta train pushes further along.\n\nIn an interview with TorrentFreak, Argentina-based developer Sebastian explained that the app runs on very simple technology \u2014 it\u2019s artfully centered upon a group of APIs, \u201cone for torrents, another for the movie info, and another for the poster, [as well as] an API for the subtitles.\u201d All of this API collaboration is via GitHub, making the end-product entirely automated with no hosting necessary. All Popcorn Time does is \u201ctake existing information and put it together,\u201d according to Sebastian.\n\nSound\u2019s great, right? Here\u2019s the catch: While torrenting itself is not illegal, downloading and/or distributing copyrighted material is. The problem here is that Popcorn Time looks a lot like Netflix, a popular and legal streaming service. It\u2019s conceivable that users could go unaware that what they\u2019re doing is against the law. And although law enforcement officials have been lax about pursuing even heavy downloaders, they have been known to go after those that upload considerable quantities of copyrighted media. And according to Popcorn Time\u2019s FAQ, you do indeed seed (upload) parts of the movie while you watch.\n\nPopcorn Time does state that \u201cyour movies will stay buried in a secret folder somewhere in your drive until you restart your computer. Then it will be gone for good.\u201d This does seem like a pretty clever cover-your-tracks feature, but there will still be a significant breadcrumb trail left behind each time you watch a movie. Even though all the high-tech stuff is happening behind the scenes, you\u2019re still torrenting.\n\nAll of the torrents come from YIFY Torrents, a non-private version of invite-only videophile film torrent sites such as PassThePopcorn. So: not only is Popcorn Time, at least for now, very illegal in the eyes of the RIAA and other industry watchdogs, it\u2019s also not as secure in terms of user data encryption and privacy as a peer-to-peer network. Potential users would do well to keep all of this in mind before engaging in what, on the surface, looks just like Netflix streaming.", "551": "The rise of Netflix has corresponded with a decline in piracy, largely due to ease of access. Sure, you can easily find countless of hours of entertainment on any number of torrent websites and similar services. But even if you're tech savvy enough to wade through all the sketchy porn ads, torrents can be risky, from both malware and legal standpoints. Netflix (or Hulu, HBO Go, or any other streaming service) is simple: Just load a video and go.\n\nIt may not solve the legal problem, but a group of programmers have come up with a new service that basically removes usability concerns from the piracy equation\u2014at least for video content. Popcorn Time, which is currently available in beta form for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or higher, is pretty much identical to Netflix for all intents and purposes. The only difference is that all of the content therein is pirated, of course.\n\nAccording to the site's FAQ, it's designed to download and stream torrented video that's \"buried in a secret folder somewhere in your drive until you restart your computer,\" at which point it's deleted. In essence, it's a torrent client dressed up with a better presentation. At face value, Popcorn Time has the potential to be truly huge.\n\nBut as the site's terms of service notes, that you might be violating copyright law, depending on where you are. So while you might not have to pay up to watch American Hustle (plus you'll get to see it earlier than people using iTunes or Amazon Video), legally speaking, you should treat the service like any other torrent site.\n\nPopcorn Time's creator isn't that concerned with legal threats, however. The Buenos Aires, Argentina-based programmer who was only identified as Sebastian told TorrentFreak that he doesn't expect any legal repercussions since \"they are just repackaging existing content, without a commercial angle.\"\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect legal issues. We don\u2019t host anything, and none of the developers makes any money. There are no ads, no premium accounts, and no subscription fees or anything like that. It\u2019s an experiment to learn and share,\u201d Sebastian said.\n\nConsidering how popular a service like this could quickly become, I'm not sure how much longer Sebastian and company will hold to that principle. A report from last month claimed that the world's top piracy sites make hundreds of millions of dollars every year off advertising revenue\u2014much of it coming from the very companies trying to tamp down on piracy.\n\nBut according to TorrentFreak, Sebastian and the rest of the Popcorn Time team are all avid Netflix users and moviegoers themselves. And really, they're just looking for an easier way to make more movies widely available as a result.\n\n\u201cWe hate that we don\u2019t have the chance to watch some movies at home. Popcorn Time is an experiment to show that you can do something better for the users, and that you can do it with BitTorrent,\u201d Sebastian said. Hey Netflix: Your move.", "552": "If Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus are any indication, torrenting isn\u2019t quite the destructive force many groups have made it out to be. Torrenting is a popular alternative to legal streaming, buying and renting, but the abundance of poor quality torrents coupled with the unfriendly method of acquiring movies and TV shows through torrenting has kept a majority of viewers glued to their TVs, browsers and tablets. If watching a ripped movie was as easy as logging into Netflix, would the tides turn in the favor of torrents? The creators of Popcorn Time want to find out.\n\nTorrentFreak has drawn our attention to what could be the most legitimate threat to the online rental and streaming services yet: Popcorn Time, an open source project which makes \u201cthe experience of watching torrent movies as simple as possible.\u201d If you live in a country where downloading copyrighted material from third-party sources is illegal, Popcorn Time could be a risky proposition, but the ease of use is astounding.\n\nFind a movie you want to see on the surprisingly well-designed UI, pick a streaming resolution and hit play. Once you\u2019re done watching, the file will be stored on your computer until you restart, at which point all traces of the torrent will be \u201cgone for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect legal issues,\u201d says Sebastian, a designer from Argentina. \u201cWe don\u2019t host anything, and none of the developers makes any money. There are no ads, no premium accounts, and no subscription fees or anything like that. It\u2019s an experiment to learn and share.\u201d\n\nIf Popcorn Time can stay out of trouble, Netflix and its ilk might have some proper competition from the torrent side of the market. Even if the torrents on the service are taken down, the program itself would likely remain intact. The team doesn\u2019t have any plans for a mobile conversion, but the desktop is being updated regularly. We can\u2019t recommend that you try Popcorn Time for yourself, but it\u2019s a fascinating development in the torrent conversation.\n\nUPDATE: Altered some language to better clarify that BitTorrent is in no way associated with Popcorn Time or its designers.", "553": "To hear Hollywood tell it, movie piracy is rampant. But while a lot of people do illegally download copyrighted content from the Internet, there are plenty of barriers to doing so.\n\nUsing BitTorrent or some other peer-to-peer tool requires some technical knowledge. There are below-the-radar websites that trade in illegal downloads, and these are easier to use \u2013 but they\u2019re often laced with malware.\n\nMovie piracy would likely be even more rampant if grabbing illicit content was as easy and painless as, say, watching Netflix on your home computer.\n\nNow, it is.\n\nPopcorn Time is an open-source project from a programmer and designer in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who goes by the name of Sebastian. According to TorrentFreak, the program is now being co-developed by 20 collaborators who are adding features at a rapid pace.\n\nThe app \u2013 available for Windows, Macintosh and Linux computers \u2013 taps into torrents for movies and streams them, just as if you were watching a film via iTunes or Netflix. It\u2019s remarkably easy to use \u2013 just browse a list of film genres or search for a title, then click the one you want. There\u2019s a brief pause while Popcorn Time connects, finds the movie and buffers. If you like, you can even watch with subtitles.\n\nIn a test, I was able to start watching \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d on Popcorn Time in less than two minutes. At this writing, \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d is available for pre-order on iTunes and Amazon Instant Video. Officially, it\u2019s not yet released for streaming.\n\nClearly, using Popcorn Time in this way is not legit. Indeed, when you first launch the app, you\u2019re warned that watching movies using it may not be legal in \u201cyour country.\u201d\n\nNaively, Sebastian tells TorrentFreak that he doesn\u2019t think there will be any legal repercussions from Popcorn Time:\n\nSince Popcorn Time links to a lot of copyrighted movies, Hollywood is not going to be happy, but according to Sebastian the developers don\u2019t expect any legal issues. They inform users that sharing copyrighted material is not allowed everywhere, and other than that they are just repackaging existing content, without a commercial angle. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect legal issues.

It\u2019s an experiment to learn and share,\u201d Sebastian notes.\n\nGood luck with that line of logic when the attorneys from the Motion Picture Association of America come calling, Sebastian.\n\nAnd indeed, something like this is bound to alarm the industry. The streaming of movies and TV shows is taking off because it\u2019s very easy to do and fairly affordable. But Popcorn Time makes it just as easy to watch content without paying for it. The movie business won\u2019t take kindly to something this simple and disruptive.", "554": "DETROIT \u2014 General Motors faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars Tuesday as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.\n\nSpokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nAt issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government\u2019s road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn\u2019t take action sooner.\n\nGM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly. When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars. The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.\n\nAlso, if the ignition switch isn\u2019t in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.\n\nAn Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale. The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM\u2019s top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem. Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.\n\nFred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement Monday that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.\n\nCongress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.\n\nUpton said the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.\n\n\u201cIf the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,\u201d Upton said.\n\nNHTSA has said the rate of problems in the GM cars was not significantly different from similar vehicles.\n\nThe prospect of congressional hearings means more bad publicity for GM, which is trying to distance itself from a reputation for building lousy cars. The company has said it\u2019s more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old GM haunting the new GM,\u201d said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine. \u201cThey have a lot of the old products still hanging around.\u201d\n\nFisher said GM\u2019s new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.\n\nNHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem. The agency could fine GM up to $35 million for a delayed response. Automakers must report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.\n\nGM said in a statement that it\u2019s cooperating with NHTSA and the House committee.\n\nOn Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).\n\nGM said Monday that it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company\u2019s actions before the recall.

In most cases, plaintiffs have received only pennies on the dollar.\n\nRelated: Congress to investigate GM recall\n\nChrysler Group got a similar liability shield when it was bailed out around the same time as GM.\n\nGM announced the recall of vehicles with the ignition defect in February. There is evidence that engineers knew of the problem for nearly 10 years.\n\n\"It's completely unfair,\" said Lance Cooper, a Georgia attorney. Cooper recently won a settlement from GM for a family whose daughter was killed in a 2010 accident involving a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, one of the cars involved in the recall.\n\n\"It's not like a traditional bankruptcy where they go out of business,\" he added. \"GM continued to exist as essentially the same company.\"\n\nClarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said his group is asking GM to waive its liability shield.\n\n\"They took the government's money, but they didn't accept responsibility to the public who paid for it,\" said Cooper. \"And it's the public that was hurt when their products injured or killed people.\"\n\nRelated: GM recall was delayed by internal miscues\n\nCooper says most of the 13 deaths cited by GM and safety investigators took place before the bankruptcy. The list of deaths has yet to be released publicly.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra, in a recent letter to GM employees, said \"We will hold ourselves accountable\" for the problems that led to the recall.\n\nWhen asked about the liability shield, GM and Chrysler have made only limited statements.\n\n\"GM is focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall,\" said GM spokesman Greg Martin. \"It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009. Our principle throughout this process has been to put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us.\"\n\nHe declined further comment when asked if GM might waive the liability shield in these cases.\n\nSome attorneys have tried to sue the auto dealers that sold the cars involved in accidents, since they are independent businesses not covered by the bankruptcy. But Cooper said that can be a tougher case to make to juries.\n\nRelated: GM CEO Barra defends recall response\n\nSome dealers, such as those that sold the now-discontinued Saturn line, have themselves gone out of business since 2009.\n\nChrysler and GM both initially proposed shedding liabilities on all vehicles sold before their bankruptcies, even if the accidents occurred after the bankruptcy. Under pressure from Congress, state attorneys generals and public interest groups, both accepted liability for accidents that occurred after the bankruptcy.\n\n\"Chrysler Group wants customers to feel comfortable and confident buying, driving and enjoying one of our vehicles,\" said Chrysler's statement on the the liability shield at that time. \"Chrysler Group vehicles meet or exceed all applicable federal safety standards and have excellent safety records.\"\n\nA Chrysler spokesman said Tuesday that the company had no further comment on the issue.\n\nOpening itself up to liability could prove costly for GM. Ditlow said he's aware of several cases in which the automakers avoided judgments of tens of millions of dollars. He thinks total savings from the liability shield for both companies is between $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) was hit with a $3 million jury award last year for a crash that was allegedly caused by unintended acceleration of a Camry. The victims in the case were both elderly women; younger victims with a lifetime of earnings ahead of them can receive far larger awards. Ongoing medical costs and pain and suffering for crash survivors can result in even larger judgments.", "556": "After the 1999 Ford-Firestone safety crisis, in which faulty tires on top-heavy SUVs were blamed for scores of fatal rollover accidents, Congress put in place a new reporting system so that regulators and automakers could spot potential safety defects earlier, before they escalated into an ongoing problem.\n\nThe Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act, enacted in 2000, was supposed to prevent the kind of crisis that General Motors now faces following its recall of 1.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths. Yet a recent New York Times report said federal regulators had received more than 260 complaints in 11 years about GM vehicles shutting off unexpectedly, but they declined to investigate.\n\n\u201cDid the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner?\u201d asked House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI), who sponsored the TREAD Act almost 14 years ago.

As a data-driven organization, NHTSA is constantly looking for ways to improve our process so we can better identify serious safety defects in the nation\u2019s vehicle fleet and ensure that those defects are remedied.\u201d\n\nThe agency has also said the data didn\u2019t clearly indicate that the stalls \u2014 which can result from everything from a faulty fuel pipe to a driver forgetting to fill the tank \u2014 were part of a larger, more dangerous pattern.\n\n\u201cRegarding the recent recall of certain GM vehicles, the data available to NHTSA at the time did not contain sufficient evidence of a possible safety defect trend that would warrant the agency opening a formal investigation,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe agency also noted its investigations have led to 929 recalls in the last seven years, pulling more than 55 million unsafe vehicles off the road. Last week, NHTSA sent a 27-page list of 107 questions to GM demanding to know what it knew about the ignition problems, when it knew it and why it didn\u2019t inform the agency.\n\nThe investigations brought to mind the last time Congress drastically overhauled the way NHTSA handles recalls. In 2000, Congress passed a law that increased fines and reporting requirements after more than 250 deaths were linked to faulty Firestone tires on Ford Explorer SUVs. The SUVs repeatedly rolled over while on the highway.", "559": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON/DETROIT: Federal prosecutors are examining whether General Motors is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and led to a recall last month, according to a source familiar with the investigation.The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability.Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago, according to the source.The source did not want to be named because the probe has not been disclosed publicly.GM declined to comment on Tuesday. Shares of GM closed down 5 percent to $35.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition switch problems.The problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the \"run\" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc, said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.One analyst said the recall could have a longer-term impact on GM. \"The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share,\" RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said.\"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM,\" he said.TWO WEEKS TO RESPONDGM is conducting an internal investigation into the matter and announced earlier this week that the probe would be led by Anton \"Tony\" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block.The criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara follows an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota's disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration by some of its vehicles.Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation previously told Reuters.The House committee examining the GM issue, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, gave the company and NHTSA until March 25 to turn over information about their responses to consumers' complaints about the problem.The committee has asked GM officials to provide a briefing no later than March 18 on how GM has responded to reports of incidents since 2003 and its interaction with NHTSA since then on problems related to the ignition defect.Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles, resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA.That law also makes it a crime to intentionally mislead the agency about defects that lead to serious accidents.The Justice Department can only open a grand jury investigation into such allegations at the request of the U.S. Transportation Secretary, according to the law.\"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall,\" a Transportation Department spokesman said in a statement.The person familiar with the criminal probe declined to discuss whether prosecutors were considering liability under the TREAD Act.- Reuters", "560": "This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nIf Bloomberg's and the New York Times' reports are correct, the Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into General Motors' car recalls (or lack thereof). This would be in addition to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation, which was announced yesterday.\n\nGM recalled 1.6 million vehicles in February \"to correct a condition with the ignition switch that may allow the key to unintentionally move or switch to the 'accessory' or 'off' position, turning off the engine and most of the electrical components on the vehicle.\" That means your car would just stop running, and your airbags would not deploy in the case of an accident.\n\nGM first began receiving reports about the faulty ignition switches in 2004, but it took a decade for it to issue the recall. In the meantime, at least 31 accidents occurred because of the ignition switches. Thirteen people died.\n\nWhile the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can fine GM up to $35 million if it finds that the company did not act quickly enough to recall the faulty switches, the DoJ can bring criminal charges. According to the New York Times, it is \"rare, but not unprecedented\" for the DoJ to do this. Last month, Toyota was said to be in final talks with the DoJ to pay more than $1 billion over its delay in recalling vehicles with acceleration issues. The recall has already cost Toyota billions in other fines and lawsuits.\n\nGM has so far declined to comment on the DoJ investigation, which is said to be in early stages.

The switches are blamed for a series of accidents in which 13 people have died.\n\nConcerns that GM had known about the problem for years before agreeing to a recall led the company to issue an unprecedented public apology. At the direction of CEO Mary Barra, GM's legal department has begun a comprehensive internal investigation, and Barra and other GM executives say they are determined to find out what happened -- and to ensure that it doesn't happen again.\n\nBut the stakes got raised on Monday: Now, Congress is launching its own investigation.\n\nNow Congress is involved, and this isn't just showboating\n\nThe U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said late on Monday that it would launch its own investigation into the recall, complete with hearings. Reports on Tuesday suggested that the U.S. Senate might shortly follow suit.\n\nSometimes, congressional hearings are held mostly to allow ambitious congresspeople an opportunity for some televised showboating. This is not likely to be that: The House committee's chairman, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, has a long-standing interest in auto safety.\n\nUpton was the lead sponsor of the Tread Act of 2000, the last major piece of auto safety legislation to pass Congress. The Tread Act came in response to a series of accidents involving Ford (NYSE:F) Explorers equipped with some types of Firestone tires. Among other things, it requires automakers to more quickly report fatal accidents linked to safety defects.\n\nIt's fair to say, in other words, that Rep. Upton has a real concern here.\n\nIs it time for GM shareholders to get concerned too?\n\nHard lessons learned from Toyota's experience\n\nAutomotive recalls happen all the time, and most are no big deal. Often the defective part is found quickly by the automaker's own internal testing, and the recall is taken care of before anyone gets injured.\n\nThe GM recall is an exception, of course. But in recent years, automakers have learned the hard way that it's in their best interest to be proactive about recalls, to err on the side of recalling more cars rather than fewer, and to do it earlier rather than later. The expense and hassle of a no-big-deal recall is trivial next to the expense, hassle, and public relations damage -- and potential legal exposure -- of a recall that is delayed too long.\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) found that out to their chagrin a few years ago. A widely publicized series of accidents led to massive global recalls in 2010 -- but only after Toyota dragged its feet for months, and made a whole series of PR blunders. There were congressional hearings in that case, too -- and CEO Akio Toyoda also apologized during his testimony.\n\nThe whole incident was a PR disaster for Toyota. It probably cost the company quite a few sales in the U.S., and did big damage to Toyota's reputation for quality. Toyota paid some hefty fines and probably had to pay out some hefty damage settlements as well.\n\nBut here's the lesson for GM: Once CEO Toyoda got involved, once Toyota became open about its internal troubles and began addressing them, the furor rapidly died down.\n\nAnd here's the lesson for GM shareholders: Fast forward to today, and Toyota's sales, reputation, and bottom line are in fine shape.\n\nIn time, it's very likely that GM's will be too. But it's possible that things could get bumpy between here and there.\n\nSo how bad will it get for GM?\n\nIt's also possible that this won't have all that much effect on GM's sales, reputation, or stock price. There are some very big differences between GM's situation today and the pot of hot water that Toyota was in four years ago -- starting with the fact that GM has clearly learned from Toyota's experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, the problematic GM vehicles were built between 2003 and 2007, before GM went into bankruptcy and began a sweeping overhaul. GM is a very different company now, under very different management, making much better products.\n\nThat separation between Old and New GM works to the company's advantage. There's a perception that GM's new leaders are working to fix long-standing problems that they inherited from the bad old days; the bureaucracy that delayed this recall was certainly one of them.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike most recalls, this one is a big deal. Over 30 accidents are blamed on the defect, and as I said above, 13 people have died.\n\nOn the other other hand, Barra and her team appear to be doing all the right things now. GM has been quite transparent over the last month about what its internal investigations have found. Those investigations were stepped up Monday, when GM announced that it had hired prominent Chicago lawyer Anton Valukas to lead the investigation. Valukas led a court-ordered investigation of failed investment bank Lehman Brothers back in 2008.\n\nGM North America chief Alan Batey did issue that public apology, and the company has launched a website to provide its customers with detailed information about the recall. The company has released a chronology of events uncovered by its investigation so far, and plans to release a more comprehensive one later this week.\n\nA big test for Mary Barra\n\nBarra has made it clear that whatever caused this problem will be found and fixed. GM is clearly taking this seriously, and sharing plenty of details about its process and its investigation's findings. From all appearances, GM is ready to make any changes that might be warranted -- and ready to accept consequences for its failure.\n\nThose are the right moves. It's no consolation to the families of those who have died as a result of the defective switches. But it's the right way to reassure future GM owners -- and current GM investors -- that this kind of thing won't happen again.\n\nLong story short, while this recall has the potential to hit GM's stock price hard, it's more likely that GM will weather the storm without serious damage. Either way, it'll be an important test of new CEO Barra's skills -- one that all GM shareholders should be watching carefully.", "563": "The U.S. Justice Department started a preliminary investigation into how General Motors Co. handled the recall of 1.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths, said a person familiar with the probe.\n\nThe inquiry is focusing on whether GM, the largest U.S. automaker, violated criminal or civil laws by failing to notify regulators in a timely fashion about the switch failures, said the person, who asked not to be named.

The company has said it\u2019s more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old GM haunting the new GM,\u201d said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine. \u201cThey have a lot of the old products still hanging around.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENTSkip\n\nFisher said GM\u2019s new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.\n\nNHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem. The agency could fine GM up to $35 million for a delayed response. Automakers must report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.\n\nGM said in a statement that it\u2019s cooperating with NHTSA and the House committee.\n\nOn Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).\n\nGM said Monday that it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company\u2019s actions before the recall.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM\u2019s ignition switch problems.\n\nThe problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed.

The defect was linked to at least 31 crashes and 13 deaths.\n\nFederal regulators at NHTSA had already opened an investigation of their own into the GM recall, questioning whether the company reported the problem in a timely manner. In announcing a congressional investigation Monday night, Upton also questioned whether either the company could have acted more quickly, with customer complaints over the switches dating back years.\n\n\"Problems involving ignition switches and stalls in the recalled GM models are not a recent or unknown phenomenon. Since 2003, consumers have filed numerous complaints,\" Upton and the other committee leaders said in their letters to the company and NHTSA.\n\nA hearing is expected in the weeks to come. GM officials said they were \"fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the committee, too. We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts.\"\n\nThe scope of the investigation could well widen further, however. Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia -- the Democratic chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee -- was talking to subcommittee officials about beginning a Senate inquiry as well.\n\nIn order to repair the ignition switch, GM is recalling 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s; 2003-2007 Saturn Ions; 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, and 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky models. The affected U.S. vehicle population totals 1.4 million.\n\nIn the letters to GM and NHTSA, House committee leaders -- including subcommittee chairmen and top Democrats, including Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, who long sat atop the panel -- asked for field reports related to ignition stalls, analyses of incident reports and \"documents that refer or relate to ... correction actions.\" They also want a time line showing reports and discussions between GM and NHTSA.\n\n\"The committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain on the road,\" said U.S. Rep.

Its policy is not to disclose whether an investigation has been opened, and to comment only if an investigation leads to charges, according to Jerika Richardson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York.\n\nGeneral Motors spokesman Greg Martin, noting the Justice Department policy, said that the company had no comment.\n\nThe report comes as the National Highway Transportation Administration already has opened an investigation into the timeliness of the GM recall and a congressional committee ramped up a separate investigation of both GM and NHTSA with demands for years of documentation and incident reports related to the switch problem.\n\nGM shares on Tuesday fell $1.91, or 5.15%, to close at $35.18, the sharpest one-day drop in more than two years.\n\nDepositions in a court case last year show that GM knew in as far back as 2004 that ignition switches in some Chevrolet Cobalts could move out of the \"run\" into \"accessory,\" killing the engine and cutting off power to the air bags and other systems.

That's not gonna happen.\n\nCongress has decided to investigate why it took so long to respond to a defect that has been linked to 13 deaths. The New York Timeshas the details:\n\nA House committee has started an investigation into the response by General Motors and federal safety regulators to complaints about faulty ignition switches that have been linked to 13 deaths, officials said on Monday.\n\nAn Energy and Commerce subcommittee will hold hearings that will most likely include the automaker and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, although the date has not been set, said Charlotte Baker, a committee spokeswoman.\n\nRBC Capital Markets' Joseph Spak considers the damage:\n\nIn our view, the immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share. The latter, to be frank, is hard to quantify...\n\nRemember while this was old (pre-bankruptcy) GM, the consumer won't differentiate. And it does appear that GM employees have known about the risk for a while, so it does seem there is a failure to act somewhere along the way. GM clearly has a test on their hands and how they manage it will likely impact the reputational risk. In term of previous comps for reputational risk, there are mixed results from large visible recalls. [Toyota Motor (TM)] lost share in their sudden acceleration recalls towards the end of last decade. [Ford Motor (F)] saw less of an impact with their Ford Explorer recall in the early 2000's. Obviously the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM\n\nJPMorgan's Ryan Brinkman and team note that Delphi Automotive (DLPH) could be in the firing line. They explain:\n\nWe learned that Delphi is the supplier in question of the ignition switches [General Motors] is recalling on 1.6 mn affected vehicles. The ignition switch was produced by a predecessor entity to the current post-bankruptcy Delphi Automotive, potentially shielding the supplier from liability, but we nevertheless expect Delphi to incur costs to assist [General Motors] in fixing the affected vehicles, which we believe both [General Motors] and Delphi are committed to doing in as expeditious a manner as possible. Delphi management commented that a typical ignition switch is an inexpensive part, sometimes costing as little as $2 to $5 to produce (suggesting a total recall cost of ~$3.2 mn to $8.0 mn, ex-labor, or ~$0.01 to $0.02 of EPS), and that swapping the ignition for a new one is not labor intensive \u2013 potentially done in only a few minutes. This contrasts with other recalls with which Delphi has been involved, which can sometimes necessitate replacement of a costlier component or one that is in a hard-to-reach area, such as deep within an engine, and was described as relatively straight-forward.\n\nShares of General Motors fell 5.2% to $35.18 today, while Ford Motor (F) dropped 1.4% to $15.30, Toyota Motor (TM) declined 0.8% to $112.46 and Honda Motor (HMC) gained 0.9% to $36.89.

It would be only the fourth automotive recall to get congressional oversight since then, according to Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator and longtime consumer advocate who has been critical of GM's response.\n\nGM said Monday it had hired Jenner & Block LLP Chairman Anton Valukas, who served as a U.S. Justice Department-appointed examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers, to lead an internal company inquiry into the handling of the ignition-switch flaw.\n\nThe company probe is being conducted jointly by a team led by Chicago-based Valukas and GM General Counsel Michael Millikin, the automaker said in a statement. Attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding are also part of the team, GM said.\n\n'Fully cooperating'\n\nThe internal company investigation is running parallel to a query from NHTSA on what steps the company took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004.\n\nGM has until April 3 to answer specific questions in a 27-page order the agency issued March 4.\n\n\"We are fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Committee, too,\" GM spokesman Greg Martin said. \"We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts.\"\n\nGM last month said heavy key rings or jarring can cause ignition switches on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. GM has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including the 13 deaths.\n\nBiggest fine\n\nThe auto-safety regulator could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the United States, if it finds the automaker didn't pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective.\n\nThe agency can also seek criminal charges. The initial recall on Feb. 13, covering 778,562 Cobalts and G5s, was widened less than two weeks later to more than 800,000 additional vehicles.\n\nThose include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices and 2006-2007 Saturn Skys. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.\n\nGM North America President Alan Batey said in a Feb. 25 statement expanding the recall to the Saturn Ion and other models that the company's \"process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.\" GM is preparing a second timeline related to that recall expansion.\n\n10-year timeline\n\nValukas, 70, was the U.S. attorney in Chicago from 1985 to 1989. He also served as special counsel to the City of Chicago investigating the city's health-care system and in 1993 was chairman of the Illinois Governor's Task Force on Crime and Corrections, which led to prison reform legislation, the law firm said in his biography on its Web page.\n\nThe company's reputation may be driven by how it responds, Barra said in a March 4 note to employees.\n\nGM \"has acted without hesitation\" to address the recall in the past few weeks, Barra said in a note on a Web site last week for employees.\n\n\"We have much more work ahead of us.\" NHTSA is seeking information on 107 separate questions about the company's steps leading to the recall, including the 10-year timeline the company provided regulators Feb. 24.\n\nThe agency said it wants names and correspondence from any employee involved in the company's attempts, going back to 2004 to investigate and isolate ignition-switch failures. It asks for details on why engineering fixes proposed in 2004 and 2005 weren't implemented.\n\n2007 meeting\n\nNHTSA also said it wants to know what happened after a 2007 meeting in which regulators and GM discussed an air bag failure after a Cobalt lost engine power.\n\nU.S. auto-safety regulators were told by a research team in 2007 of a possible link between defective ignition switches and air bags not deploying.\n\nGM described the issue in a technical service bulletin to dealers the previous year that the automaker said resulted in repairs for 474 customers.\n\nNHTSA didn't start a defect investigation at the time and GM didn't issue a recall until this year. NHTSA is also facing questions about why more wasn't done to address the Cobalt safety questions in 2007 and earlier.\n\nClaybrook on March 7 asked the Transportation Department's inspector general to investigate. The most recent safety issue to get a congressional hearing was in early 2010, when Toyota Motor Corp.

The centre, along with several other groups, is also calling for a congressional investigation.\n\nNHTSA officials in defence of the agency's actions said, they had long been concerned about potential stalling.\n\nThough the agency initiated probes into suspicious crashes caused by the faulty switches, investigators failed to find the root cause of the accidents.\n\nThe Detroit News reported that General Motors Co for years collected numerous warning signs from customers and employees about problems with Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions pertaining to engines stalling and ignition switches moving to ''accessory'' or ''off'' while driving.\n\nIn one complaint, a Maryland resident said he almost crashed into a tractor-trailer in his 2005 Cobalt. Another, a mother five months pregnant who was driving with a 5-year-old - bought a 2005 Cobalt and shortly thereafter reported, a lock up of the vehicle's steering column which caused it to spin out of control.\n\nAccording to court records, the auto maker bought back at least 13 2005-06 Chevy Cobalts from customers who had reported engine stalling or power loss since spring 2005.\n\nThis came from a June 2013 deposition of GM senior manager/consultant Victor Hakim, who worked in a department that assessed vehicles.", "581": "By Ben Klayman, Paul Lienert and Nick Brown\n\nDETROIT, March 10 (Reuters) - General Motors hired two law firms with ties to the automaker to look into its recall of cars blamed for 13 deaths, and a congressional committee said it would also investigate the company's response to a defect that first came to light a decade ago.\n\nThe internal probe will be led by Jenner & Block Chairman Anton \"Tony\" Valukas, who investigated Lehman Brothers after the financial services firm collapsed in 2008, and alleged then that Lehman used accounting gimmicks and had been insolvent for weeks before it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nGM has worked with Jenner & Block since 2002, and at least two of the automaker's former top attorneys, Robert Osborne and Elmer Johnson, were partners at the Chicago law firm.\n\nGM said lawyers from King & Spalding, which represented GM during some of its bankruptcy proceedings and other litigation work since, will also work on the recall review ordered up by GM CEO Mary Barra.

He is the ideal person to do that, given his understanding of our business and his reputation for adhering to the highest standards.\"\n\nJenner and King may indeed speed things along, Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law, said. \"It makes sense as a matter of efficiency since the firms know the client,\" he told Reuters.\n\nIn a letter to employees last week, Barra promised an \"unvarnished\" look at the recall that's occurring 10 years after the issue first came to light. She hasn't granted any interviews on the matter.\n\nGM is recalling cars to correct a condition that could allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle is traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.\n\nThe failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the \"run\" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee said it is investigating GM and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's response to consumer complaints related to the problems with ignition switches.

The Japanese manufacturer wound up issuing massive recalls, paying record fines, defending itself in huge lawsuits, and overhauling how it deals with U.S. regulators.\n\nSince that multi-year investigation, the industry has been quicker to identify problems in many cases and issue recalls, and NHTSA has made improvements in how it handles those matters.\n\nStill, not all issues are resolved without controversy.\n\nIn its letter to GM, NHTSA demands a list of documents and records, including engineering drawings, field reports, consumer complaints, lawsuits against GM, and transcripts of deposition testimony by any GM employee, former employee, consultant or expert witness.\n\nIt also seeks internal emails and records about the company\u2019s deliberations about the problem.\n\nGM spokesman Alan Adler said the company has been in contact with NHTSA about the request.\n\n\u201cWe always cooperate and we fully intend to do everything they\u2019re asking by the time they\u2019re asking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intent is to comply with their date.\u201d\n\nGM\u2019s new chief executive, Mary Barra, has said the company acted \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d and that it went \u201cwell beyond\u201d the recommendation of technical experts.\n\nBut in its chronology, GM said some company engineers knew of the problem with the switch 10 years ago.\n\nBarra said the problems were first brought to the attention of her team \u201ca few weeks ago\u201d and that she led a committee that acted immediately when informed about the problem.\n\nIn the company\u2019s apology, GM North American President Alan Batey admitted in a statement last month: \u201cThe process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.\u201d\n\nEven that acknowledgment is the subject of a NHTSA question \u2014 Describe in detail the ways in which GM\u2019s process \u201cwas not as robust as it should have been\u201d and GM\u2019s plans, if any, to change its process.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, former NHTSA administrator and longtime safety advocate Joan Claybrook asked GM to be forthcoming when notifying car owners about a recall.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that GM\u2019s letter to owners be a true safety alert, emphasizing the real possibility of death or severe injury,\u201d she wrote in a letter to the company.\n\nThe recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac\u2019s G5 and Solstice, and Saturn\u2019s Sky and Ion.\n\nGM said dealers will replace the ignition switch to prevent \u201cunintentional or inadvertent key movement.\u201d Until that is performed, vehicle owners should use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring, GM said.", "588": "Google add-ons boost Docs and Sheets in new Word strike\n\nGoogle has integrated add-ons to Google Docs and Sheets, allowing developers to offer new tools to streamline users\u2019 workflows such as citing sources, sending customize emails en-masse, and getting feedback from other reviewers.

The Add-on store has tools made by third-party developers (and a few Google originals) that you can install to add features to documents and spreadsheets that weren't available before, like creating labels or sending customized emails. The feature resembles the Google Play Store and currently features about 30 add-ons.\n\nThis is a way for Google to enhance Docs and Sheets with some of the features that are mainstays in Microsoft's Word and Excel programs. One of the launches is an add-on from Avery Label Merge, which lets you merge data from a Google spreadsheet into Avery address labels. Mailchimp's add-on lets you choose different templates and make customized emails, and then send them from directly within Google Docs.\n\n)\n\nAnd then there are some unexpected add-ons that could prove to be really useful. EasyBib\u2019s Bibliography Creator lets students look up academic sources, and then create and insert citations into a document in MLA, APA, and Chicago Manual of Style formats. UberConference also released an add-on that lets you invite people via email to a voice conference call from within a document, letting a group edit that document all together.

From there, you'll be asked to add one or more add-ons, very similar to the way you can add packaged apps to a ChromeOS Chromebook, for example. I counted 34 plug-ins that users could add to Docs, and 29 for Sheets. However, the only way to tap into the new plug-ins for Sheets is to opt into the new version that Google launched last December.\n\nRight now, Google appears to be launching with fewer apps that what Microsoft offers inside of its Office Store, although you'll find some \"crap apps\" there in Microsoft's store, such as a placeholder text generator. However, there are some exclusives: Microsoft offers an Avery Templates app, but Google offers an improved version that allows a user to actually merge addresses to create labels. Google is also highlighting EasyBib Bibliography Creator\u2014a capability Office has had for some time, but that Google's Docs never offered. And there's Letterfeed's Track Changes add-on, as well.\n\nThe EasyBib plug-in adds bibliography capabilities to Google Drive's Docs app.\n\nIn other words, there's a pattern: Google is tapping into third-party development tools to address its most glaring weaknesses compared to Office. You'll find several template tools (Office provides these natively) as well as a Sheets plug-in to plug in Google Analytics data.\n\nMicrosoft added collaboration to its Office Web Apps (now dubbed Office Online) last year, and has embraced collaboration in a big way with a vision of Office that's shared and social. But app developers who brought their technology to the Office Store have said previously that they've been disappointed with the takeup from customers. So far, Google hasn't indicated how or whether it will allow Google Drive/Docs users to tap into live data queries, as Microsoft has, although those solutions are available on Google's developer site.\n\nStill, Google can take its new plug-ins strategy as a strategic response to cities, school systems, and other agencies waffling between Microsoft Office and Google Docs, and who are unsure about moving away from the tried-and-true Office suite. Whether or not Google continues to add to its plug-in offerings is an open question.", "591": "Google, Screenshot by Richard Nieva/CNET\n\nGoogle on Tuesday announced the launch of add-on features for Google Docs and Sheets.\n\nThe launch opens up the software to work with outside developers, who will be able to offer up integrations that can help with specific tasks, like printing labels or sending customized emails.

A \"user\" refers to an individual account belonging in the customer domain. So, for example, if you were to convince a business with 125 users to sign up for a Google Apps account, you would be rewarded for 100 of those new users.\n\nReferring customers also will be able to offer new account holders coupons to save $10 per user for the first year. The referrers will receive more of those coupons as they continue to refer, according to Google.\n\nIn order to participate, referrers must reside in the U.S. or Canada, and they must give Google a valid taxpayer ID and bank account information for a direct deposit. There is no limit to the number of people they can refer, but the bonus amount will be based on the number of users who have paid for the service for at least 120 days.\n\nLow-Risk Experiment\n\nReferral programs sometimes can be an effective way to haul in new customers, but in this case, the bonus might be going to the wrong people, said Dave Michels, principal analyst at TalkingPointz.\n\n\"Most referral programs are aimed at consumer products or services and work because they tap into personal networks of influence,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"I doubt such a program will be that effective for Google, because the Google Apps decision is typically made by IT leadership. The general population doesn't have much influence over IT decision makers.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean it won't bring in any new customers, but it could be more limited than Google is hoping, said Frank Ohlhorst, IT business consultant and analyst at GigaOM.\n\n\"Google's referral program is bound to generate some business for the company,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"However, it seems that ... small businesses will benefit the most from it -- and those businesses have very limited reach to other businesses that will adopt Google Apps. Perhaps a better approach would be to offer small businesses free services that are driven by ad revenue and then, for a fee, eliminate the ads.\"\n\nStill, Google has the pockets to experiment with this and could be in the process of learning more about how to snag some new users via referrals, Michels added.\n\n\"Google is great at experimenting, and really there isn't much risk here,\" he pointed out. \"If it works, they are happy, and if it fails, that's OK too.\"\n\nTaking On Microsoft\n\nIf it does fail, the company will need to be more creative in taking on Microsoft Office and Office 365, the primary competition to Google's productivity suite, said J. Gerry Purdy, chief mobility analyst at Compass Intelligence.\n\n\"The interesting thing to me is that this is just a referral program -- not a conversion or trade-in or some mechanism to get folks to essentially give up using Office,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\n\nThe problem with a more competitive campaign to win new users is that pitting Google Apps directly against Microsoft's Office products could be a grim reminder that Google has very big shoes to fill if it wants to take on the established giant in the space. Improving the product would be a better way to attract new users than a referral program will be, said Michels.\n\n\"Google Apps has always been positioned against Office as a simpler product for less money,\" he noted. \"The problem is Microsoft has narrowed the price gap, so a simpler solution for about the same price doesn't play well -- plus several popular features are still missing from Google Apps. Google has some nice advantages around multi-user collaboration, but unless Google picks up the pace, Microsoft is likely to eliminate Google's advantages.\"\n\nRachelle Dragani is a freelance reporter based in Brooklyn, NY.

They further studied the blood results of 53 with mild cognitive impairment \u2013 or AD \u2013 including 18 who developed disease symptoms during the testing, and another 53 who remained cognitively healthy.\n\nThey found ten complex lipids, known as phospholipids, that were present at consistently lower levels in the blood of most people who had, or went on to develop, cognitive impairment. The team validated the results in a set of 41 further participants and determined the 90 percent accuracy.\n\nA report on the study today by National Public Radio says, \u201cThe finding could lead to a quick and easy way for seniors to assess their risk of Alzheimer's, says Dr. Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University. And that would be a \u2018game changer,\u2019 he says, if researchers find a treatment that can slow down or stop the disease.\n\n\u201cBut because there is still no way to halt Alzheimer's, Federoff says, people considering the test would have to decide whether they are prepared to get results that \u2018could be life-altering.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes that his results will have to be validated by others and larger studies: \u201cWe also have to look at different age groups and a more diverse racial mix, and we need longer study periods.\u201d\n\nDo we really want to know?\n\nJon Hamilton, in his report on NPR, quoted and paraphrased Dr. Jason Karlawish, professor of medicine, medical ethics and health policy, University of Pennsylvania, on the ethics of being able to predict Alzheimer\u2019s -\n\n\"That knowledge can be a good thing. That's been shown among people who chose to be tested for a gene that increases the risk of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Knowing their risk of developing cognitive impairment is very relevant to making plans around retirement and where they live. So there is certainly a role for knowing that information.\n\n\"On the other hand, people who have the Alzheimer's gene and know it tend to rate their own memories as worse than people who have the gene but don't know it. And knowing you carry the gene also seems to hurt people's performance on memory tests.\n\n\"But the biggest concern about Alzheimer's testing probably has to do with questions of stigma and identity. How will other people interact with you if they learn that you have this information? And how will you think about your own brain and your sort of sense of self?\n\n\"The stigma and fear surrounding Alzheimer's may decrease, though, as our understanding of the disease changes. Right now, people still tend to think that either you have Alzheimer's disease dementia or you're normal, you don't have it.\n\n\"But research has shown that's not really true. Alzheimer's is a bit like heart disease. It starts with biological changes that occur years before symptoms appear. And there is no bright line separating healthy people from those in early stages of the disease.\"\n\n\u201cThere is not yet a good treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide,\u201d says Simon Lovestone, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was quoted in the Nature Medicine report on the study.\n\n\u201cSeveral promising therapies have been tested in clinical trials over the last few years, but all have failed. However, those trials involved people who had already developed symptoms. Many neuroscientists fear that any benefits of a treatment would be missed in such a study, because it could be impossible to halt the disease once it has manifested. \u201cWe desperately need biomarkers which would allow patients to be identified \u2014 and recruited into trials \u2014 before their symptoms begin.\u201d\n\n>> Original report, associated information at Nature.com.\n\n", "602": "Study claims technique can predict with 90% accuracy whether people will go on to develop Alzheimer's within three years\n\nScientists have developed a new blood test that they claim could detect whether or not a person will develop dementia within three years.\n\nChanges in the blood may signify Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages, researchers found.\n\nA study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90% accuracy whether people will go on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's.\n\nIt is the first research that has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer's before the symptoms occur and people who will not go on to develop the condition.\n\nThe finding has potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's at an earlier stage - when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing onset of symptoms, the authors said.\n\nResearchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years.\n\nDuring the research 28 participants went on to develop the conditions and 46 were diagnosed at the start of the study.\n\nMidway through the research, the authors analysed 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and 53 \"cognitively normal\" people.\n\nThey discovered 10 molecules that appeared to \"reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's.

Now, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can cost as little as $1,000, with the procedure taking just days.\n\nWhen sequencing an organism's DNA, the order of DNA nucleotides is documented by machines. This ordering is transcribed in letters - A, C, G and T - which each represent a particular piece of DNA (adenines, guanines, thyamines and cytosines). The human genome is made up of 3 billion of these letters.\n\nUsing the genome sequence, scientists are able to find genes much more easily. In a clinical setting, it is hoped that WGS could quickly and accurately reveal the genetic basis of family diseases. Even in healthy individuals, it is believed that WGS can uncover potentially important information about a person's genes and their health.\n\nFor example, Medical News Today recently reported on new research that looked at using WGS to select embryos for in vitro fertilization.\n\nHowever, it is rare that the clinical findings of WGS are reported. Therefore, scientists do not have much information on how effective or reliable WGS is as a clinical tool.\n\nThree Main Problems in Using WGS to Diagnose Disease or Risk of Disease\n\nResearchers from the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease in California recruited 12 adult volunteers who underwent WGS between Nov. 2011 and March 2012. The results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, and the researchers published their findings in the journal JAMA.\n\nThe study identifies three problems with using WGS in a clinical setting.\n\nFirstly, the study found that WGS' coverage of inherited-disease genes was incomplete. Being able to accurately map the important parts of the genome for diseases that run in families is more difficult than mapping other sections of the genome.\n\nSecondly, the researchers could not reproduce all of the genetic variations that were detected, and the experts in the study could not agree on which types of variation were important for disease.\n\nThirdly, the experts in the study disagreed on which of the WGS results were most meaningful, or \"clinically reportable.\"\n\nConsequently, the authors conclude that although the analytical validity of WGS is improving, there are still technical challenges with assessing individual results.\n\nAlthough the financial cost of the sequencing has made the technology more accessible, there are still \"considerable\" human resource needs in order to interpret and validate the data returned by WGS.\n\nWriting in a linked comment, JAMA associate editor Dr. William Gregory Feero says that studies like this \"provide a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate that much remains to be learned about previously assumed to be 'known' information as well as myriad 'known unknowns' and 'unknown unknowns' before truly successful widespread integration can occur.\"\n\nHe adds: \"A question facing potential early adopters of genome sequencing as an adjunct to patient care is whether or not having WGS data, at this time, will decrease uncertainty and improve outcomes or merely exponentially increase the complexity of clinical care.\"", "605": "Whole-genome sequencing for clinical use faces many challenges, study findS\n\nMark Tuschman description of photo\n\nWhole-genome sequencing has been touted as a game-changer in personalized medicine. Clinicians can identify increases in disease risk for specific patients, as well as their responsiveness to certain drugs, by determining the sequence of the billions of building blocks, called nucleotides, that make up their DNA.\n\nNow, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered that although life-changing discoveries can be made, significant challenges must be overcome before whole-genome sequencing can be routinely clinically useful. In particular, they found that individual risk determination would benefit from a degree of improved sequencing accuracy in disease-associated genes. Furthermore, up to 100 hours of manual assessment by professional genetic counselors or informatics specialists is required for detailed genome analysis.\n\nAlthough the technique was once prohibitively expensive, plummeting costs have been widely expected to rapidly usher whole-genome sequencing into the arena of mainstream health care. However, the researchers\u2019 findings indicate that clinical advances from whole-genome sequencing are, at least in the near future, likely to be significantly more expensive and labor-intensive than some patients and clinicians may have been led to believe.\n\nDoing it right\n\n\u201cWe need to be very honest about what we can and cannot do at this point in time,\u201d said Euan Ashley, MD, associate professor of medicine and of genetics, one of three senior authors of the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if we sequence enough cases, we can change someone\u2019s life. But with this opportunity comes the responsibility to do this right. Our hope is that the identification of specific hurdles will allow researchers in this field to focus their efforts on overcoming them to make this technique clinically useful.\u201d\n\nThe paper was published March 12 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics, and Thomas Quertermous, MD, professor of medicine, also share senior authorship of the paper. Postdoctoral scholar and cardiology fellow Frederick Dewey, MD, genetic counselor Megan Grove, CGC, and postdoctoral scholar Cuiping Pan, PhD, share lead authorship of the paper.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the whole genomes of 12 healthy people and took note of the degree of sequencing accuracy necessary to make clinical decisions in individuals, the time it took to manually analyze each person\u2019s results and the projected costs of recommended follow-up medical tests.\n\n\u201cThis has been an important project for the Stanford team for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it represents the initial genetics effort to make use of the Stanford GenePool Biobank,\u201d said Quertermous, the William G. Irwin Professor in Cardiovascular Medicine. GenePool was recently launched to promote genomic research in a clinical setting and to improve patient care; the 12 people in the study were the first participants in the effort.\n\n\u201cGenePool gives Stanford patients the opportunity to participate in ground-breaking research and is a great opportunity for collaboration among Stanford translational researchers,\u201d Quertermous said.\n\nTime and money\n\nThe researchers estimated a cost of about $17,000 per person to sequence the genome and interpret and analyze the average of nearly 100 genetic variations deemed important enough for follow-up in each person. Each variation required approximately one hour of investigation to assess the relevant scientific literature and determine whether the change was indeed likely to modify disease risk in the individual. After this process, the researchers were left with approximately two to six results they felt could be clinically important; doctors who reviewed the results as part of the study suggested follow-up tests that carried costs of less than $1,000 per person.\n\nMichael Snyder\n\nIn one of the 12 cases, however, the payoff of this intensive process was big: A woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer learned she carried a potentially deadly deletion in her BRCA1 gene. After confirmation of the finding in a clinical cancer genetics setting, she was able to take action to reduce her future risk for breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are clearly challenges in bringing whole-genome sequencing into the clinic, this finding was clearly medically significant,\u201d Dewey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to predict from a study of 12 people how often this type of clinically actionable discovery will occur, but it definitely supports the use of this technology.\u201d\n\nOne significant challenge is the need to decisively determine the sequence of genes already known to be associated with disease. Dewey and his colleagues found that commercially available whole-genome sequencing does not achieve the accuracy necessary to identify every nucleotide in about 7 to 16 percent of genes known to be associated with increased disease risk. While a degree of uncertainty is allowable during studies of populations, which look for trends by comparing hundreds of genomes, it makes it impossible to make accurate predictions about one individual\u2019s health status.\n\n\u201cThese off-the-shelf genome sequencing techniques were developed to provide generally good coverage of most of the genome,\u201d Dewey said. \u201cBut there are some regions that remain to be covered well that we care very deeply about. We still need to supplement this information with additional sequencing in some regions to make clinically usable decisions.\u201d\n\nDangerous or normal?\n\nThe study may affect a recent recommendation by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics that so-called \u201cincidental findings,\u201d a term used to describe the discovery of potentially disease-associated variations identified during sequencing conducted for an unrelated medical reason, be routinely reported to an individual. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in the sequences of the 56 genes identified by the college could either give the appearance that a dangerous variation is normal, or cause unnecessary alarm and follow-up tests if a gene is mistakenly deemed to have a dangerous mutation.\n\nThomas Quertermous\n\nIn particular, the two sequencing technologies used in the study \u2014 one from San Diego-based Illumina Inc. and one from Mountain View-based Complete Genomics Inc. \u2014 had difficulty in reliably identifying regions of the genome with small insertions or deletions of nucleotides. These types of changes are particularly important because they can cause the abrupt termination of a protein coding sequence within the DNA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic, and slightly sobering, that we struggle the most in identifying insertions and deletions \u2014 those changes in the genome that are most impactful,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nOnce the sequences have been determined, it\u2019s necessary to figure out which changes, or variants, are likely to be important. Dewey and his colleagues found that the amount of manual labor involved in sifting through the many variants in each individual approached 100 hours. That\u2019s because, with the exception of a few well-known mutations, there is no standard way to assess the potential health impact of each change. In the study, three genetic counselors, three clinicians specializing in informatics and one medical pathologist examined each variant and assessed the relevant medical literature (including publications on animal and human studies, as well as genetic databases) to determine potential disease risk.\n\nThese challenges are particularly striking in the absence of a specific diagnostic question. \u201cIt remains significantly harder to use whole-genome sequencing for disease prediction than for disease diagnosis,\u201d said Dewey.\n\nFollow-up tests\n\nVariants expected to have potential health consequences were then shared with three primary care physicians and two medical geneticists, who independently studied the results and recommended possible follow-up tests for each person. In general, the projected costs for the tests were less than the researchers predicted \u2014 ranging from $351 to $776.\n\n\u201cSome experts in this field feel that this type of testing causes more harm than good, and may lead to very expensive follow-up tests,\u201d said Snyder, who is the Stanford W. Ascherman, MD, FACS, Professor in Genetics. \u201cSo it was interesting that costs were projected to be relatively modest.\u201d\n\nAlthough some of the findings of the study are somewhat sobering, the authors are confident that the field of whole-genome sequencing is worth pursuing. Sequencing technology is evolving, and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, is meant to help speed the identification of clinically important variants and reduce the burden of manual investigation. Stanford professor of genetics Carlos Bustamante, PhD, is a co-principal investigator on a ClinGen project to improve predictions of disease-associated variants in a variety of populations.\n\n\u201cOur intention in doing this analysis was to draw a line describing where we are with this technology at this point in time and identify how best to move forward,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThings are becoming more clear, and the challenges to bringing this technique to the clinic are becoming crystallized.

But a small study suggests that looking for disease risks that way may not be ready for the masses.\n\nFor one thing, the research found that gene variants most likely linked with significant disease were the least likely to be accurately identified.\n\nAnd analyzing the mass of data from the DNA scan is a daunting task, researchers said.\n\nSome experts think more targeted gene-mapping is a better approach. But while whole genome sequencing is mostly done for research, it has far-reaching potential for diagnosing and treating genetic diseases, even in people with no known risks. The new results show its promise and its challenges.\n\nStanford University researchers performed whole genome sequencing in 12 healthy people. Most of the millions of genetic variants they found were of uncertain significance, although one woman was found to have a high genetic risk for cancer.\n\nDNA is recovered by a simple blood test and deciphered by machines.

That takes days of sophisticated follow-up lab tests and interpretation to reveal potentially meaningful genetic information, the researchers said.\n\nDr. Euan Ashley, a senior co-author and Stanford associate professor of medicine and genetics, likened the technology to \"an unruly teenager who has grown up very fast.

For about 10 percent to 19 percent of genes that may be related to inherited diseases, the sequences were not reliable enough to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe researchers also used a computer program to sift the participants' genetic data to identify the mutations that should be examined more closely - about 100 per participant.\n\nIt took researchers about one hour to research each mutation, which ended up costing about $15,000 per patient in manpower.\n\nExperts who examined the data also disagreed on the significance of some of the specific variants examined.\n\nOverall, a handful of genetic variants for each patient were reported to a group of primary care doctors, who then made recommendations about whether the patient should receive additional tests or be referred to specialists.\n\nThe doctors recommended between one and three referrals or medical tests per patient based on the results. The cost for that testing ranged from about $350 to $800.\n\n\"The use of whole genome sequencing was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable whole genome sequencing findings,\" the researchers write.\n\nHowever, they note that one participant did find out about a gene variant that put her at an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

Clinicians can identify increases in disease risk for specific patients, as well as their responsiveness to certain drugs, by determining the sequence of the billions of building blocks, called nucleotides, that make up their DNA.\n\nNow, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered that although life-changing discoveries can be made, significant challenges must be overcome before whole-genome sequencing can be routinely clinically useful. In particular, they found that individual risk determination would benefit from a degree of improved sequencing accuracy in disease-associated genes. Furthermore, up to 100 hours of manual assessment by professional genetic counselors or informatics specialists is required for detailed genome analysis.\n\nAlthough the technique was once prohibitively expensive, plummeting costs have been widely expected to rapidly usher whole-genome sequencing into the arena of mainstream health care. However, the researchers' findings indicate that clinical advances from whole-genome sequencing are, at least in the near future, likely to be significantly more expensive and labor-intensive than some patients and clinicians may have been led to believe.\n\n\"We need to be very honest about what we can and cannot do at this point in time,\" said Euan Ashley, MD, associate professor of medicine and of genetics, one of three senior authors of the paper. \"It's clear that if we sequence enough cases, we can change someone's life. But with this opportunity comes the responsibility to do this right. Our hope is that the identification of specific hurdles will allow researchers in this field to focus their efforts on overcoming them to make this technique clinically useful.\"\n\nThe paper will be published March 12 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics, and Thomas Quertermous, MD, professor of medicine, also share senior authorship of the paper. Postdoctoral scholar and cardiology fellow Frederick Dewey, MD, genetic counselor Megan Grove, CGC, and postdoctoral scholar Cuiping Pan, PhD, share lead authorship of the paper.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the whole genomes of 12 healthy people and took note of the degree of sequencing accuracy necessary to make clinical decisions in individuals, the time it took to manually analyze each person's results and the projected costs of recommended follow-up medical tests.\n\n\"This has been an important project for the Stanford team for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it represents the initial genetics effort to make use of the Stanford GenePool Biobank,\" said Quertermous, the William G. Irwin Professor in Cardiovascular Medicine. GenePool was recently launched to promote genomic research in a clinical setting and to improve patient care; the 12 people in the study were the first participants in the effort.\n\n\"GenePool gives Stanford patients the opportunity to participate in ground-breaking research and is a great opportunity for collaboration among Stanford translational researchers,\" Quertermous said.\n\nThe researchers estimated a cost of about $17,000 per person to sequence the genome and interpret and analyze the average of nearly 100 genetic variations deemed important enough for follow-up in each person. Each variation required approximately one hour of investigation to assess the relevant scientific literature and determine whether the change was indeed likely to modify disease risk in the individual. After this process, the researchers were left with approximately two to six results they felt could be clinically important; doctors who reviewed the results as part of the study suggested follow-up tests that carried costs of less than $1,000 per person.\n\nIn one of the 12 cases, however, the payoff of this intensive process was big: A woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer learned she carried a potentially deadly deletion in her BRCA1 gene. After confirmation of the finding in a clinical cancer genetics setting, she was able to take action to reduce her future risk for breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n\"Although there are clearly challenges in bringing whole-genome sequencing into the clinic, this finding was clearly medically significant,\" Dewey said. \"It's not possible to predict from a study of 12 people how often this type of clinically actionable discovery will occur, but it definitely supports the use of this technology.\"\n\nOne significant challenge is the need to decisively determine the sequence of genes already known to be associated with disease. Dewey and his colleagues found that commercially available whole-genome sequencing does not achieve the accuracy necessary to identify every nucleotide in about 7 to 16 percent of genes known to be associated with increased disease risk. While a degree of uncertainty is allowable during studies of populations, which look for trends by comparing hundreds of genomes, it makes it impossible to make accurate predictions about one individual's health status.\n\n\"These off-the-shelf genome sequencing techniques were developed to provide generally good coverage of most of the genome,\" Dewey said. \"But there are some regions that remain to be covered well that we care very deeply about. We still need to supplement this information with additional sequencing in some regions to make clinically usable decisions.\"\n\nThe study may affect a recent recommendation by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics that so-called \"incidental findings,\" a term used to describe the discovery of potentially disease-associated variations identified during sequencing conducted for an unrelated medical reason, be routinely reported to an individual. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in the sequences of the 56 genes identified by the college could either give the appearance that a dangerous variation is normal, or cause unnecessary alarm and follow-up tests if a gene is mistakenly deemed to have a dangerous mutation.\n\nIn particular, the two sequencing technologies used in the study \u2014 one from San Diego-based Illumina Inc. and one from Mountain View-based Complete Genomics Inc. \u2014 had difficulty in reliably identifying regions of the genome with small insertions or deletions of nucleotides. These types of changes are particularly important because they can cause the abrupt termination of a protein coding sequence within the DNA.\n\n\"It's ironic, and slightly sobering, that we struggle the most in identifying insertions and deletions \u2014 those changes in the genome that are most impactful,\" Ashley said.\n\nOnce the sequences have been determined, it's necessary to figure out which changes, or variants, are likely to be important. Dewey and his colleagues found that the amount of manual labor involved in sifting through the many variants in each individual approached 100 hours. That's because, with the exception of a few well-known mutations, there is no standard way to assess the potential health impact of each change. In the study, three genetic counselors, three clinicians specializing in informatics and one medical pathologist examined each variant and assessed the relevant medical literature (including publications on animal and human studies, as well as genetic databases) to determine potential disease risk.\n\nThese challenges are particularly striking in the absence of a specific diagnostic question. \"It remains significantly harder to use whole-genome sequencing for disease prediction than for disease diagnosis,\" said Dewey.\n\nVariants expected to have potential health consequences were then shared with three primary care physicians and two medical geneticists, who independently studied the results and recommended possible follow-up tests for each person. In general, the projected costs for the tests were less than the researchers predicted \u2014 ranging from $351 to $776.\n\n\"Some experts in this field feel that this type of testing causes more harm than good, and may lead to very expensive follow-up tests,\" said Snyder, who is the Stanford W. Ascherman, MD, FACS, Professor in Genetics. \"So it was interesting that costs were projected to be relatively modest.\"\n\nAlthough some of the findings of the study are somewhat sobering, the authors are confident that the field of whole-genome sequencing is worth pursuing. Sequencing technology is evolving, and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, is meant to help speed the identification of clinically important variants and reduce the burden of manual investigation. Stanford professor of genetics Carlos Bustamante, PhD, is a co-principal investigator on a ClinGen project to improve predictions of disease-associated variants in a variety of populations.\n\n\"Our intention in doing this analysis was to draw a line describing where we are with this technology at this point in time and identify how best to move forward,\" Ashley said. \"Things are becoming more clear, and the challenges to bringing this technique to the clinic are becoming crystallized. Whole-genome sequencing has the power to be absolutely transformative in the clinic.\"\n\nSource: Stanford University Medical Center", "609": "For best viewing, click the bottom right corner for full screen.\n\nAction Points In this exploratory study, the use of whole-genome sequencing was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes.\n\nThere was also low reproducibility of detection of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable findings; but in certain cases, sequencing will identify clinically actionable genetic variants warranting early medical intervention.\n\nDespite \"huge\" potential to identify hidden disease risks, whole-genome sequencing is not ready for its close-up.\n\nThat's the bottom line of a small study that looked at the reliability, accuracy, and medical utility of sequencing all of the DNA of 12 volunteers, according to Thomas Quertermous, MD, of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute in Stanford, Calif., and colleagues.\n\n\"Sequencing the whole human genome teaches us a lot, but we're not really ready to do this in prime time with large numbers of humans,\" Quertermous told MedPage Today.\n\nBut, he added, none of the problems he and his colleagues reported in the March 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association are \"insurmountable -- we will eventually get there.\"\n\nExperts outside the study team told MedPage Today that Quertermous is correct that the technology is not ready for widespread use but has enormous promise if problems can be fixed.\n\n\"The potential is great; the challenge, however, is getting it right,\" said Ronald Crystal, MD, of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.\n\nTechnical issues are likely to be solved soon, he told MedPage Today, but there are gaps in medical knowledge -- especially about the genetics of complex diseases -- that have to be filled.\n\n\"It's going to take several years before that gets sorted out,\" Crystal said.\n\nIndeed, the study offers \"a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate(s) that much remains to be learned,\" commented William Gregory Feero, MD, PhD, of the Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency in Fairfield, Me.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Feero argued that early adopters of the technology run the risk of being snowed under by data that can't be easily used in making clinical decisions.\n\nThe question, he wrote, is whether data from whole-genome sequencing -- until problems are ironed out -- \"will decrease uncertainty and improve outcomes or merely exponentially increase the complexity of clinical care.\"\n\nFor years, researchers have used genome-wide association studies, as well as local sequencing of regions of interest, to try to pin down genes associated with disease.\n\nNow that many such genes are known, there is increasing interest in using genetics to individualize medicine, either by sequencing just the exome (the DNA that codes for proteins) or the whole genome.\n\nWhole-exome sequencing is cheaper, but Quertermous and colleagues noted that the cost of a whole-genome sequence is approaching $1,000 and both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing are \"increasingly used in clinical medicine.\"\n\nWhole-genome sequencing is expected in most cases to uncover variation that has clinical significance, regardless of why the sequencing was ordered in the first place, the researchers noted.\n\nFor that reason, it's important to know how reliable, accurate, and useful such data is, they argued.\n\nTo help find out, they enrolled 12 people -- five men and seven women -- and sequenced their whole genome, using two different commercial technologies. Genetics professionals interpreted the results using available gene data banks, and medical doctors proposed follow-up based on the genetic findings.\n\nBut, Quertermous and colleagues reported, there were problems:\n\nResults from the two sequencing approaches did not completely agree.\n\nSome regions of the genome -- including some with known variants associated with disease risk -- were not well covered.\n\nThe genetics professionals were not in complete agreement on how to interpret the results, and the medical professionals did not always agree on what to do with them.\n\nGenetics databases were incomplete; for each participant about 100,000 previously unidentified variants were found.\n\nFor each participant, the investigators reported, the sequencing turned up from two to six personal disease-risk findings, and physician review of the findings led to consideration of a median of one to three initial diagnostic tests and referrals per volunteer.\n\nOne of the disease-risk variants -- a frameshift deletion in the BRCA1 gene implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer -- was \"very likely pathogenic,\" the researchers reported.\n\nThe participant involved did not have a family history that would have warranted referral for testing, but after the finding was confirmed by a separate test, she had prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and intensified imaging-based breast cancer screening, the researchers reported.\n\nAs well as finding disease risks, whole-genome sequencing is expected to uncover genetic variations that might affect drug choice or dosing. In this study, Quertermous and colleagues reported, 11 participants had such genetic variants.\n\nGenetic databases \"clearly need to be improved,\" Quertermous told MedPage Today, because they are incomplete as they stand.\n\n\"For each human that we sequenced,\" he said, \"there were approximately 100,000 new variants that had never been identified before.\"\n\n\"That's an amazing amount of data,\" he added.\n\nThe technical issues of reliability and reproducibility are probably not going to take long to fix, Crystal commented, but such unidentified variants won't be found in the databases, making interpretation difficult for clinicians.\n\n\"For many of the genetic variants in the human genome, there just is not sufficient medical knowledge,\" he said.\n\nThe study was supported by the NIH, the Breetwor Family Foundation, and the LeDucq Foundation.

Members of the Senate panel were visibly moved.\n\n\n\n\"No one can sit here and listen to this with a dry eye,\" said Aaron Bean, R-Jacksonville, bill co-sponsor and chairman of the Health Policy Committee.\n\nInstead of merely providing a defense for Dravet Syndrome families arrested for possession of CBD medical marijuana, as HB 843 does, Senate Bill 1030 talks about legalization for patients listed in a statewide \"compassionate use\" registry.\n\n\n\nOnly physicians could decide whose names go into the registry; and the physicians would include only the names of individuals who have been \"cleared\" for \"low-THC\" treatment.\n\n\n\nDoctors would have to keep careful records of how effective the treatment is because the bill requires them to submit detailed quarterly reports to the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. SB 1030 provides $1 million for the college to conduct research on the reports.\n\nThe Senate bill would also allow patients to ingest the medicine by vapor, a form of intake not mentioned in the House bill.\n\n\n\nFinally, the plant extract, limited to no more than 0.5 percent THC (the euphoric component) and at least 15 percent CBD (the beneficial component), would be available from up to four dispensaries statewide.\n\nThe House bill, HB 843, stipulates that strains of marijuana with 0.8 percent or less of the psychoactive component in marijuana, and more than 10 percent of the plant's CBD strain will be legal -- as will its seeds.\n\nStill, bill co-sponsor Rob Bradley, R-Orange Park, a former prosecutor and chairman of Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations,said he feels strongly that \"any law that would define (families dealing with such suffering) as criminals defies common sense and is a law that should be changed.\"\n\nThe Senate always was expected to be the friendlier chamber to a medical marijuana bill.\n\nFor House sponsor Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar and his prime co-sponsor Katie Edwards, D-Plantation, it has been a long, hard slog to change hearts and minds.

It featured the stories of many families with severely epileptic children, some from Florida.\n\nGupta told the story of the Bundukamaras, Franncis, a teacher in Miami-Dade public schools, and Cristi, a nurse practitioner and professor at Miami Dade College. They decided to move their family to Colorado, where they could get the Charlotte's Web marijuana strain their 14-year-old son Reggie needed.\n\n\"You basically have two choices -- you try to do it illegally, or you uproot your family, so that's what we did,\" Cristi tells Gupta. \"This was our only hope. We almost lost Reggie a couple of times in the last two years. ...\"Reggie was experiencing 25 to 100 grand mal seizures a month when the family arrived in Colorado. On a bad day, he would have hundreds of smaller seizures.\n\nNow on a course of Charlotte's Web, Reggie's medications have been drastically reduced. Last month, he was down to 13 grand mal seizures, and he's eating and communicating again.\n\nCristi says on camera she's no longer sure she would go home even if Florida passed medical marijuana laws.\n\n\"It was so hard to uproot and leave, and we're just getting settled,\" she says. \"But it still feels like home.

The Senate plan, passed for the first time in a committee on Tuesday, would legalize the substance. In contrast, the House proposal would not decriminalize the product but would provide individuals arrested, investigated or charged with a crime an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d that they could use to prove their innocence in court.\n\nBoth proposals deal with Charlotte\u2019s Web, a strain of marijuana low in tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component in marijuana, but high in the derivative cannabidiol, or CBD.\n\nThe Senate measure (SB 1030), unanimously approved by the Senate Health Policy Committee on Tuesday, would create a statewide \u201ccompassionate use\u201d registry of individuals deemed by their physicians to be eligible for \u201clow-THC\u201d treatment. The Senate plan would also allow users to ingest the substance by vapor, something not expressly permitted in the House version. And it would allow up to four dispensaries to distribute the substance, which could contain no more than .5 percent of THC and at least 15 percent CBD.\n\nDoctors could write the prescriptions for people who suffer from seizure disorders and who do not respond to other treatments, and keep records of how effective the treatment is. Doctors would have to submit quarterly reports about the efficacy of the treatment to the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, which would conduct research on the reports. The Senate plan would set aside $1 million to cover the research.\n\nUnder the House plan (HB 843), people who have strains of marijuana that contain .8 percent or less of THC and more than 10 percent of CBDs, along with the seeds of the plant, would have an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d available to them if they are caught with the substance or charged with a crime. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said he hopes that law-enforcement officials and prosecutors won\u2019t go after families, growers or doctors involved with Charlotte\u2019s Web. The House version also allows for higher concentrations of THC and lower concentrations of CBD, which supporters say would treat more types of neurological diseases than the Senate\u2019s more restrictive levels.\n\nAs in previous hearings on the hybrid, the Senate panel heard from parents who believe their children would benefit from the treatment \u2014 and fear they could die without it.\n\nPeyton and Holley Moseley\u2019s 11-year-old adopted daughter RayAnn is one of about 125,000 Florida children diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that can cause hundreds of seizures a day and does not respond to other treatments. The couple traveled to Colorado, where Charlotte\u2019s Web is manufactured, and met with the child for whom the hybrid is named, who can now walk and talk.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, to ask for that opportunity for RayAnn and other children in Florida,\u201d Holley Moseley said.\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, a former prosecutor, said that lawmakers need to do something to help the \u201cwonderful, inspirational parents\u201d who are looking to the Legislature for help.\n\n\u201cAny law that would define them as criminals defies common sense and is a law that should be changed,\u201d Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said.\n\nGOP leaders in both the House and the Senate support the concept of making the non-euphoric pot available to parents whose children are wracked with hundreds of seizures a day and which can be fatal.\n\nAnd many Republican lawmakers are galvanizing support around Charlotte\u2019s Web \u2014 which doesn\u2019t get users high and isn\u2019t smoked \u2014 as a more acceptable alternative to the medical marijuana question that will go before voters in November. The proposed constitutional amendment \u2014 bankrolled by Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, who is also Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist\u2019s boss \u2014 would let doctors write prescriptions for severely ill patients. Republicans insist the amendment gives doctors too much discretion over who is eligible for the pot treatment and, if passed, would result in \u201cpot shops on every corner.\u201d\n\nSome GOP holdouts are reluctant to legalize any form of pot for personal and political reasons. Some fear that voters will interpret authorization of Charlotte\u2019s Web as tacit approval of traditional medical marijuana. Others are concerned that the House proposal lacks the details necessary to ensure that the product delivered to patients is controlled and regulated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that we can thread the needle so that we can help these families in some way and yet not abandon our whole understanding of drug safety and dosage and testing.

In fact, one family has managed to reduce the amount of medication their child needs by using the marijuana.\n\n\"We've been able to reduce her pharmaceuticals by 50 percent as a result of using Charlotte's Web,\" said Paula Lyles, the child's mother, in an interview with CNN.com. \"It's ridiculous. I didn't want to do it, but now that I'm out here on the other side I know I'm where I'm supposed to be. I wanted to do anything to save Jordan's life.\"\n\nNeedless to say, this case provides strong support for the use of medical marijuana. Yet while some states are legalizing the drug, others are holding out. While it may take time, though, it's possible that we may see a U.S. where pot is legal in the future.", "616": "Every day, police in the Kansas City metro area are inundated with calls to handle mental illness emergencies.\n\n\"Usually more than one time a day,\u201d says Don Ash, sheriff of Wyandotte County, Kan. \u201cCalls could come in from a family member. Calls could come in from the general public. From a business owner.\u201d\n\nSomeone might be picked up for something as simple as loitering or trespassing, and even though it might clearly a mental health emergency, police typically have little choice but to take them to jail or possibly an emergency room.\n\nBut a new facility in the works in Kansas City, Kan., raises hope that local police will soon a better option.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback announced Jan. 23 that a former state psychiatric hospital near the University Of Kansas Hospital, which has been mostly mothballed during the past few years, is being converted into a mental crisis stabilization facility.\n\nA Department of Justice report shows that nearly two-thirds of jail inmates in have some kind of mental health problem. Some have committed real crimes, but many have not.\n\nAsh believes taking these people to jail is not a great way to deal with a crisis, and it taps police resources.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not available to be doing what the public truly expects them to be doing, and that is really dealing with suppressing crime or investigating crime,\" Ash said.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that this is gonna be one of the most helpful and significant changes in the mental health system and its delivery in this state over the past, even couple of decades,\u201d Brownback said when he announced the facility in Kansas City, Kan.\n\nThe Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan., has been all but empty since being cited for safety violations and staffing concerns in 2011. It will reopen April 1 as the first of the new 24/7 crisis stabilization centers in Kansas. Patients might stay a few hours or a few weeks. The new facility will have 10 longer-stay beds, compare to 50 beds in the previous Rainbow incarnation.\n\nMany involved in mental health agree the new facility could make a big difference, but see it just one step forward after years of falling behind on supporting mental illness.\n\n\"There's been a steady erosion over the past seven, eight years on both sides of the state line,\" Susan Crain Lewis, President and CEO of Mental Health America of the Heartland, says of mental illness funding in the state.\n\n\"It\u2019s not been a question of \u2018let\u2019s get something more\u2019 it\u2019s like \u2018how can we hold on to the bare minimum?\u2019\u201d\n\nState grants were created in the early 1990s to fund community mental health centers in Kansas. That funding was cut in 2008-09 and has fluctuated since then. The state attributes recent cuts to lower Medicaid caseloads.\n\nMissouri has also seen significant cuts for safety net services: about $17 million since 2010.\n\nLewis says those cuts have meant the uninsured and underinsured can\u2019t get the help they need.\n\n\u201cThe minute you can\u2019t go to your doctor for any amount of time, you get sicker,\u201d says Lewis.\n\nMany advocates trace a new interest in funding mental health to the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when a 20-year-old man who may have had a mental illness killed 26 people.\n\n\u201cYou always hate that it takes something like that for us to start paying attention to thing we know we need to be doing, but it did - I think - change the concentration on this issues,\u201d says Brent McGinty, President and CEO of the Missouri Coalition of Community Mental Health Centers.\n\nMcGinty says that in the last year, the Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and legislature have done a lot more for mental health, with programs like the \u201cStrengthening Mental Health\u201d initiative.\n\nAbout a month after the Sandy Hook shooting, Gov. Brownback announced plans for a new Kansas mental health strategy. He said he would channel $10 million into a regional mental health hub system.\n\nBrownback's new mental health strategy includes the rehabilitation of the Rainbow Mental Health Facility, and Sheriff Ash says it will make a difference.\n\n\u201cI believe we will start to see a reduction in some of these people that we see, or that we see on a regular basis,\u201d Ash explains.\n\nSusan Crain Lewis is optimistic, but cautious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge help, but it doesn\u2019t solve all of the problems,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nEven though the crisis center will fill an important gap, Lewis believes grant money still needs to be restored for community mental health centers. She says those funds are needed to help continue keeping people well after the work of the crisis center has ended.\n\n\u201cThe connection\u2019s essential, but how long can that connection hold?\u201d Lewis asks. \u201cAnd how much can the community mental health center bear with no more revenue for the ongoing needs of those people?\u201d\n\nThe crisis invention approach may be spreading, however.

This decision will cost much more in the long term as it will drive up admissions to A&E and the number of people reaching crisis and needing expensive hospital care.\"\n\nNorman Lamb, the care services minister, has called the decision to penalise mental health services \"flawed and unacceptable\".\n\nDr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cWe support the government's commitment to bringing about equality between mental and physical health. However, this simply will not happen until more resources are made available for mental health. It is therefore hugely disappointing to hear that NHS England is not planning any uplift in mental health funding.\n\n\u201cMental health services are currently under huge pressure as they face increasing levels of demand, high rates of bed occupancy, and insufficient staff numbers. This development is a further blow as we know that many mental health trusts have had their funding reduced in recent years, which has exacerbated the situation.\u201d", "618": "A \u201clost generation\u201d of young people could occur if key mental health services are not protected from funding cuts, charities have warned.\n\nRethink Mental Illness said early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services - which help people recover from psychosis - are struggling to survive across England.\n\nFurther cuts will result in \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of young people suffering psychosis missing out on key care - affecting recovery and leading to extra costs for the NHS due to hospital stays, it said.\n\nNew data from Rethink shows that 50 per cent of EIP services in England have faced cuts in the past year, some by as much as 20 per cent.\n\nMore than half of EIP services surveyed said the quality of care they can offer has fallen in the last year, while 58 per cent have lost staff.\n\nThe charity warned that, in some places, EIP services are being disbanded completely despite the fact many are already over-stretched and unable to meet local demand.\n\nIt also warned about the impact of NHS England and Monitor setting a higher efficiency requirement - therefore suggesting less income - for mental health services in 2014-15. The issue has been highlighted by HSJ in recent months, including criticism from health minister Norman Lamb.\n\nJane Hughes, director of communications and campaigns at Rethink, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that these crucial services are going through major funding cuts.\n\n\u201cEarly intervention is absolutely critical in helping young people recover from psychosis, which affects around 220,000 people in England. This care saves lives - it reduces the risk of a young person with psychosis taking their own life, from as much as 15 per cent to just 1per cent.\n\n\u201cIt also offers the NHS huge savings, by helping young people avoid reaching crisis-point and being hospitalised. If early intervention care was available to everyone who needs it, the NHS would save \u00a344 million each year care through reduced use of hospital beds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why cutting early intervention care makes no sense whatsoever. The human, social and economic costs of are too great, especially at a time when mental health hospitals are completely over-stretched and unable to cope with demand.\n\n\u201cWe are at risk of losing a generation of young people who, with the right support, could have good quality of life and play a meaningful role in society. We wouldn\u2019t accept this situation for young people with cancer, so why should it be different for young people with psychosis?\u201d\n\nSarah Brennan, chief executive of YoungMinds said: \u201cThe report supports research undertaken by YoungMinds which found that two-thirds of local authorities in England have reduced their child and adolescent mental health services budget since 2010.\n\n\u201cThese services play a vital role for vulnerable children, young people and their families and intervening early minimises escalation of problems and associated costs. It not only makes economic sense to invest in early intervention services, but there is also a clear moral imperative to do so.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health spokeswoman said the government has invested over \u00a350 million into improving access to treatment for young people with mental health problems.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds. We are clear that the NHS must place equal priority on physical and mental health - decisions on how to spend NHS money should reflect this.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with Rethink and are jointly convening a Psychosis Summit next month to understand how better care can be provided to people with psychosis.\u201d", "619": "Picture: Rex Features/Phaney\n\nPatients lives will be put at risk due to controversial NHS funding changes for mental health services that \u2018completely contravene\u2019 the government\u2019s commitment to treating mental health on an equal footing to physical health, experts warn.\n\nIn a letter to the Guardian, six leading mental health organisations say the decision to impose a 20% higher cut in the tariff for NHS mental health and community services than for acute hospitals next year will mean vital support is cut for patients at a time when services are already \u2018straining at the seams\u2019.\n\nNHS England and health regulator Monitor are imposing a 1.8% cut in tariff prices for community and mental health providers in 2014/15.

NHS England and Monitor argued that non-acute service providers did not need extra money to tackle understaffing because Francis's recommendations did not cover them. However, David Cameron and several ministers have made clear that providers of all types of NHS care should be improving their staffing levels if necessary.\n\nDoing so will cost non-acute providers about \u00a3150m, the same amount that they are losing in effect to subsidise hospital services, according to an estimate drawn up by the Foundation Trust Network.\n\nNorman Lamb, the care services minister, has called the decision to penalise mental health services \"flawed and unacceptable\".\n\nLord Victor Adebowale, chief executive of the addiction and mental health charity Turning Point, has called the decision \"bordering on laughable\".

Cuts to local authority social care budgets \u2013 the majority of which have hit since 2009 \u2013 have left a funding shortfall for care of up to \u00a3260 million, the charity said.\n\nMind extracted the data from research published by the London School of Economics in December last year. When demographic changes are accounted for, the fall in the number of mental health service users in receipt of social care support since 2005 could be as high as 68,000 \u2013 a 48% drop. The reduction in the number of people with physical health needs receiving social care support was 33%.\n\nThe report also found that almost a third (30%) of councils had halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.\n\nPaul Farmer, Mind\u2019s chief executive, said the findings suggested the government was failing to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d around support for people with mental health needs.\n\n\u201cIn reality it is cheaper to provide preventative services like social care, which help people affected by mental health problems at an earlier stage, in comparison to crisis services that are currently understaffed and overstretched,\u201d he said.\n\nFarmer also urged the government to introduce a \u2018more reasonable\u2019 national threshold for social care than the current plans to set it at a level equivalent to the \u2018substantial\u2019 band used by the vast majority of local authorities. The powers to set a national threshold for care are included in the government\u2019s Care Bill, which is expected to complete its journey through Parliament shortly.\n\nFrontline social workers have also raised concerns over funding for services.

Thresholds for social care have already gone up in many areas as there is less money to go around. It feels like we are increasingly unable to intervene earlier and work with people to access social elements that can help to maintain their mental health and avoid crises,\u201d he said.\n\nFaye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers mental health forum, also said that rising thresholds for social care were leading to less preventive work.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to support someone\u2019s recovery it\u2019s about things like supporting them to integrate into their community, helping them to access employment or benefits, supporting them to get their life back.

But the next day\u2019s story dwells on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d said Lisa Smusz, executive director of Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services, or PEERS, an Alameda County, Calif.-based nonprofit working to end mental health stigma and discrimination.\n\nMore of us are dealing with various forms and degrees than we may realize, she said. Nearly 46 million adult Americans \u2014 one in five \u2014 experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nBut while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are \u201cinvisible,\u201d said Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission in Berkeley, Calif. In a workplace, a person\u2019s condition may only show up in subtle ways he behaves, or in gaps in his work history.\n\nAt the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness \u2014 along with getting medication, a good therapist, family support and living healthy lifestyle, said Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.\n\nWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several San Francisco Bay Area residents say they\u2019ve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.\n\nA 54-year-old Foster City, Calif., woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments \u2014 which included visits to her therapist \u2014 prevented her from meeting her quotas.\n\nLike Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesn\u2019t want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.\n\nDixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at a program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.\n\nBut a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, she\u2019s heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didn\u2019t think she \u201cfit into the culture.\u201d\n\nLike others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County, Calif.-based Stamp Out Stigma.\n\nBut being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.\n\n\u201cI told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually.\u201d His interviewer told him, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the time for that.\u201d\n\nThe lesson for Velarde? He won\u2019t be an \u201chonest employee\u201d again \u2014 at least not until after he\u2019s landed the job.\n\nThe person who rejected Velarde may have been breaking the law. Federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, said Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.\n\nStill, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders said. This is especially true for people who work in any field \u2014 from law enforcement to high tech \u2014 where depression or anxiety could be viewed as \u201ca weakness.\u201d\n\nBy law, employers must provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.\n\nOn a positive note, Saunders added that in most disputes he\u2019s handled between an employer and a worker, \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to work things out.\u201d\n\nOften it\u2019s just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesn\u2019t lessen a person\u2019s ability to be a productive employee, he said.\n\nFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not \u201cbeing a team player,\u201d said Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, an Ohio-based national employer coalition. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t before had a way to address the subject. It's a hands-off topic,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles said.\n\nThe initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.\n\nA new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with \u201clived experience\u201d sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are in part funded by California Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health \u201cconsumers\u201d to work in mental health organizations.\n\nJulian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregon\u2019s state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Commission of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder \u2014 a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia \u2014 is considered an asset.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first place where I\u2019ve been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s cool for me personally, that I\u2019ve been hired not despite of my experiences, but because of those experiences.\u201d", "627": "Maryland lawmakers are moving to make it easier to medicate mental hospital patients against their will, while examining the idea of court-ordered therapy for mentally ill people who aren't hospitalized.\n\nThe legislation is based partly on recommendations from a panel convened by Gov. Martin O'Malley after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. That case prompted a national debate about the adequacy of care for mentally ill Americans.\n\nBut while some mental health advocates have long sought additional tools to better manage treatment \u2014 for the sake of the patient and public safety \u2014 the proposals have created a rift in the health care community. Some argue such measures are inhumane and unconstitutional.\n\n\"This is part of the dilemma in choosing between, on the one hand, necessary treatment, and having high respect for people's individual rights,\" said Del. Dan Morhaim, the General Assembly's only physician and sponsor of the medication legislation. \"We are trying to strike the right balance and really help those who need it.\"\n\nThe state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene supports legislation that would expand the circumstances under which a doctor could medicate mental health patients without their consent. In those cases, as a check and balance, a review must be done by a clinical panel.\n\nHealth officials argue that the longer patients go without treatment, the worse their illness and chances for recovery become.\n\nSome lawmakers want further study of a proposal that would allow patients to be forced to get outpatient treatment. They also want an outside panel to study other alternatives, such targeted outreach efforts called \"assertive community treatment\" that engage those with mental illnesses rather than forcing treatment.\n\nOther measures that would make it easier to have people committed are less assured of passage. One bill would clarify the criteria needed to have somebody hospitalized when they have a psychotic break, but opponents warned the commitment process could be abused. A Senate committee voted against that proposal.\n\nThe state health department supports clarifying the standards for hospitalization of mentally ill patients, but it would rather see changes made through regulation, not legislation.\n\nUnder the law, patients must be deemed a danger before they can be hospitalized, but practitioners and institutions widely interpret the definition of dangerous.\n\nThe health department recently studied deficiencies in the state's behavioral health system that led to periods without care for those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and other conditions. Those breaks can on rare occasions lead to dangerous situations.\n\n\"There are some people that may not be in a position where they can make decisions about their treatment,\" said Dr. Gayle Jordan-Randolph, deputy secretary for behavioral health at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who chaired the panel.\n\nBut balancing the need for treatment against individual rights is difficult, experts said.\n\nForcing people into treatment may not be effective, said Linda Raines, chief executive officer of the Mental Health Association of Maryland. She said it might be more effective to engage patients and help them understand they need help.\n\n\"Why don't we give people the option first to let them self-select what will make them better,\" Raines said.\n\nShe called some of the legislation proposed in the General Assembly a \"substantial and frightening step backward\" that would merely increase the number of people who are institutionalized.\n\nOthers say steps must be taken to ensure the mentally ill get the care they need before a crisis occurs. In fiscal year 2012, an analysis of Medicaid data found that 588 people, or less than 1 percent of the state's mental health population, accounted for one-quarter of all emergency department visits. Those patients visited the emergency department six or more times in a year. Many are believed to have a mental disorder called anosognosia, which causes them not to recognize that they are sick.\n\nSome families of mentally ill patients say they can't afford to wait for more studies.\n\nDr. Steven Sharfstein, CEO of Sheppard Pratt Health System, supports mandatory treatment options because he has seen families desperate to help their loved ones. Doctors sometimes tell them the only way their relatives can get help is if they get arrested, he said.\n\n\"Families will tell you about how frustrated and frightened they are because their family member won't get care and how much havoc it creates,\" Sharfstein said.\n\nSome mental health advocates back mandatory outpatient care as a way to ensure consistent care and fewer hospital visits. Many patients learn to manipulate the system, adhering to treatment while institutionalized but going back to their old ways once released, advocates said.\n\n\"There are people who cycle in and out and don't get stabilized in the community,\" said Kate Farinholt, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Maryland. \"They end up getting released into the community with recommended treatment, with a history of not getting that recommended treatment, and becoming dangerous to themselves or others and getting hospitalized again. Or worse yet, picked up and put in jail or prison.\"\n\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland and Maryland Disability Law Center support a community approach to treatment that provides basic services such as housing to improve the living conditions \u2014 and mental state \u2014 of the mentally ill.\n\n\"Assertive community treatment\" programs have been successful in other states, but have proved expensive. New York has spent $2 billion on its program.\n\n\"As a general principal, we do not believe coercion is a benefit to anyone in the long run,\" said Laura Cain, managing attorney for the Maryland Disability Law Center. \"We believe there are alternatives to engage people voluntarily. In the longer run, when a person becomes motivated on their own, that is where recovery actually begins.\"\n\nTonier Cane said she is an example of how forced treatment doesn't work.

She blames her bipolar disorder, depression and drug addiction.", "628": "Massachusetts leaders are increasingly looking toward specialty courts to redefine how people with mental illness or drug problems interact with the judicial system. The Boston Bar Association president calls specialty courts \"the wave of the future.\"\n\nIn his most recent budget, Gov. Deval Patrick has called for increasing the number of mental health courts from four to six. These courts operate in a much different way than traditional courts.\n\nIn the traditional court, a defendant with a mental illness may be convicted and sentenced to jail time and probation. In the mental health court, the defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced to a different kind of probation: instead of going to prison, participants receive mental health treatment with substantial oversight.\n\nRather than having a probation officer check in once a month to make sure they are not breaking any laws, participants in mental health court are assigned a case manager and a probation officer. They are connected to mental health services in the community and have to check in with the court judge every week.\n\nGuest\n\nJudge Rosemary Minehan, Plymouth District Court judge who has presided over the mental health court since 2011 and chairs the District Court Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse.\n\nDr. Debra Pinals, assistant commissioner of Forensic Mental Health Services for the state Department of Mental Health.\n\nMore\n\nWBUR \"(T)here are strict criteria, including a verifiable history of mental illness, and a defendant must agree to participate in a rigorous treatment plan.

The opposite is quickly becoming true,\" said Tom Angell of . \"A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana , and you're going to start seeing more politicians running toward our movement instead of away from it, just as we've seen happen with marriage equality recently.\" \"It's time for politicians to catch up to the voters on this issue.

The opposite is quickly becoming true,\" said Marijuana Majority . \"A majority of Americans support legalizing, and you're going to start seeing more politicians running toward our movement instead of away from it, just as we've seen happen with marriage equality recently.\"\n\nIn fact, it does seem the tide is changing in the favor of those who support legal marijuana use, as there are currently 14 U.S. states that have lowered the penalty for a person carrying small amounts.\n\nIn Rhode Island, for example, officials have decriminalized amounts that seem to be for personal use, so someone carrying less than an ounce of marijuana will be subject to a $150 ticket with no jail time.\n\nJohn G. Edwards, a Rhode Island state representative, feels that decriminalizing small amounts of pot is a move towards a sensible solution to the nation\u2019s drug problem.\n\n\u201cI am very proud that Rhode Island will be able to begin a new chapter in sensible drug policy today,\u201d said Edwards in a press conference.\n\n\u201cAs I have said many times before, I firmly believe that people should be able to work, volunteer and live their lives after being caught for a youthful indiscretion or two. What we have been able to do with this law is effectively punish those in possession of small quantities of marijuana while giving people opportunities to redeem themselves by allowing them to be productive members of society.\u201d\n\nThrowing kids in jail\n\nAnd as far as teen marijuana use is concerned, Sen. Josh Mille of Rhode Island\u2014like other state officials on his side of the argument\u2014says proper education instead of throwing kids in jail may be the right move to get them to stop or at least remove the forbidden fruit aspects of smoking the controversial green stuff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from what we\u2019ve been able to glean from the Special Senate Commission to study the prohibition of marijuana that education and treatment are better for addressing teen marijuana use than incarceration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also saving money by keeping people out of jail for minor marijuana infractions and putting money where it can best serve our communities: drug education programs for young violators.\u201d\n\nSurf's not up everywhere\n\nHowever, a bill in Hawaii over the decriminalization of marijuana didn\u2019t go quite the same way. State lawmakers there defeated a bill that would have followed in the footsteps of places like Rhode Island.\n\nThose concerned about decriminalizing pot in the Aloha State, like former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, say lightening marijuana laws will only increase people\u2019s dependence on it.\n\n\u201cHawaii\u2019s rates of marijuana use are significantly higher than in the rest of the country,\u201d said Kennedy, chairman of SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), an organization that considers itself bipartisan in the marijuana debate.\n\nSAM wants the U.S. to shift towards laws that will neither criminalize low-level users, nor create policies that will increase people\u2019s dependence on marijuana.\n\n\u201cFewer kids in Hawaii think smoking marijuana is harmful compared to kids in the United States as a whole,\" added Kennedy. \"I have seen firsthand the debilitating effects of marijuana addiction. It\u2019s more than just the addict, it\u2019s the families who suffer too.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of legalizing marijuana note that the Pew Research survey does not support Kennedy's position.\n\n\"There is no significant difference in lifetime or recent use between people in states with some form of legalized marijuana and those in other states,\" the Pew researchers found.\n\n\"Opinions about legalizing marijuana vary little among states that have more permissive marijuana laws and those that do not. A majority (55%) of those in states that have legalized medical marijuana or have decriminalized (or legalized) marijuana for personal use favor legalizing marijuana . Yet 50% of those in states in which marijuana is not decriminalized (or legal for any purpose) also favor its legalization,\" the study found.\n\nObviously the debate on marijuana use will continue, as more states are tweaking some of their laws, some aren\u2019t changing them at all, and others like New Hampshire are considering legal recreational use, so the conversation is likely to go in a million more places before all is said and done.\n\nIn Vermont, Attorney General Bill Sorrel said he\u2019s in favor of the decriminalization of marijuana, and says it\u2019ll lower those crimes that are attached to people seeking out dealers. Sorrel even said he\u2019s in favor of Vermont residents growing their own marijuana plants for the same reason.\n\n\u201cThis might be a surprise to some,\u201d he said in a hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cBut the reality is possession of small amounts of marijuana has in effect been decriminalized for quite some time in this state. If you take away the ability to grow your own, you\u2019re pushing someone who wants to possess and use marijuana into the marketplace of having to deal with marijuana dealers. And is that the behavior you essentially want to require and foster?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see where the nation is on marijuana laws at the close of this year.

I\u2019ve invested more than 30 thousand hours investigating this one subject.\n\nAnd what I\u2019ve found sickens me. It compels me to reject with my very being the concept of a Drug War. It is a scam, a feckless, endless, mindless pursuit of global success and salvation. It\u2019s been more than 40 years since President Nixon declared the war on drugs to \u201cGo after the blacks without appearing to do so\u201d.\n\nIt is now over 50 years since the United Nations declared their war on drugs with the belief that they would eliminate drugs from planet Earth within 5 years. Barbarous drug cartels worldwide love this situation. It makes them billions of dollars per year.\n\nCocaine was made a federal offense when politicians proclaimed that black men on Cocaine would rape white women, or at a minimum would fail to step off the sidewalk when a white man approached.\n\nIn 1937, because Mexicans were taking our jobs and they \u201cmight\u201d rape white women while high on Marijuana, the feds crafted the Marijuana Tax Act which was later declared unconstitutional in Leary vs. U.S., then put under the regimen of the ludicrously named Controlled Substances Act.\n\nOver the lifetime of the Drug War, more than 45 million non-violent US citizens\u2014have been arrested for these plant products in their pocket. The US has invested over 1 Trillion dollars trying to stop the flow of these drugs. And at the same time, drug users worldwide have invested 10 Trillion dollars in purchasing these drugs. These barbarous cartels, the terrorists and the thousands of U.S. gangs make 400 Billion dollars a year from this policy.\n\nSo what have we wrought? What benefits? What positives have we derived from maintaining this policy? And what are we likely to derive if we continue this forever? Most politicians are so ignorant as to avoid this question at any cost, but when I spoke with former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, I asked him \u201cIs there anything positive that we derive from this Drug War?\u201d and he said, \u201cNothing, there is no benefit\u201d, he closed his thought with, \u201dprohibition doesn\u2019t work\u201d.\n\nBelief in the Drug War allows ignorance to be used as a badge.

Belief in Drug War encourages feigned hysteria and overblown fears which are now being used as a bludgeon.\n\nBefore prohibition of these drugs, a gram of pure Cocaine could be bought at the drug store for twenty-five cents. Now, the youngsters out there are buying a contaminated, often polluted, gram of Cocaine that could go over one hundred dollars per gram.

Today after all this hoopla, 1 and \u00bd percent of us are addicted.\n\nAfter forty years, fifty years, more than a hundred years of Drug War, it\u2019s time to face facts. The Drug War is a pipe dream of men who have long since died. It has become a quasi-religion, a belief system that attracted many adherents within law enforcement and the criminal justice system to speak from ignorance, bigotry and steadfastly in support of primitive creeds, platitudes and irrational tradition.\n\nThose who make their bones from this policy\u2014and by God the cemetery is overflowing from their efforts\u2014cannot now back down from their prior pronouncements. They dare not jeopardize their reputation, their legacy; by now embracing the truth that the Drug War is vacuous, hollow and a horrendous mistake. Until we face this truth, these cheerleaders for Drug War, these Drug War addicts, will continue their eternal chant, their everlasting rain dance in the eye of this Drug War hurricane.\n\nThe answer to the Drug War? Legalize. Stop funding the Taliban. Gut the cartels. Eliminate most of the gangs. Let Pfizer produce it and let Walgreen sell it.

Statistics can be gleaned from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and other sources about the prevalence of alcohol use, alcohol use disorders, underage drinking, alcohol-related conditions, and fatalities.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the number of alcoholics in the United States because there is no official diagnosis of \"alcoholism.\" Since the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in May 2013, drinking problems have been diagnosed as alcohol abuse disorders, ranging in level from mild to moderate to severe. Even before then, in the DSM-IV, published in 1994, alcohol use disorders were broken down into two categories: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.\n\nAlcohol Use\n\nAmong people 18 years or older, an estimated 86.4 percent reported they had consumed alcohol at some point during their lives; 70.1 percent said they had a drink within the past 12 months and 56.0 percent said they drank alcohol within the past 30 days.\n\nPrevalence of Binge Drinking and Heavy Drinking\n\nAn approximate 26.9 percent of all adults in the U.S. reported engaging in binge drinking in the past 30 days and 7.0 percent admitted to heavy drinking in the past month. For the NSDUH survey, binge drinking was defined as five or more drinking on the same occasion on at least one day in the past 30 days. Heavy drinking was defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on five or more days in the past 30 days.\n\nAlcohol Use Disorders\n\nAn estimated 6.2 percent of adults over 18\u2014about 15.1 million people\u2014had an alcohol use disorder. This included 9.8 million men and 5.3 million women, or 8.4 percent of all adult men and 4.2 percent of all adult women.\n\nOf the people with a drinking problem, only 6.7 percent received professional treatment for their alcohol use disorder in the past year from a facility specializing in alcohol treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nBreaking it down further, only 7.4 percent of men and 5.4 percent of women who needed help for an alcohol problem actually sought help for that problem.\n\nThe prevalence of heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorders are highest among men aged 18 to 24, and men who are unemployed.\n\nSeveral studies have found that binge drinking was most common among non-Hispanics whites, those with some college education, and those with an annual family income $75,000 or more. In contrast, alcohol use disorders were most common among American Indians or Alaskan Natives, those having less than a high school education, and those with an annual family income of less than $25,000.\n\nAlcohol Use Disorders Among Youth\n\nAmong youth ages 12 to 17, an estimated 623,000 had alcohol use disorders, including 325,000 females and 298,000 males. Among U.S. adolescents, 2.5 percent had already developed an alcohol use disorder. During the previous 12 months, only 5.2 percent of those with a drinking problem received treatment in a rehab facility.\n\nAlcohol-Related Deaths\n\nEach year, an estimated 88,000 people\u201462,000 men and 26,000 women\u2014die from alcohol-related causes. This makes alcohol abuse the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. In 2014, there were 9,967 deaths attributed to alcohol-impaired driving.\n\nPrevalence of Underage Alcohol Use\n\nA CDC report from 2014 said that, among 15-year-old Americans, 35.1 percent reported having had at least one drink and about 22.7 percent reported drinking within the past 30 days. That included 23 percent of males and 22.5 percent of females.\n\nAmong those from age 12 to age 20, 14.2 percent\u2014about 5.4 million\u2014reported binge drinking. That includes 15.8 percent of males and 12.4 percent of females. Approximately 3.7 percent of this age group\u2014about 1.4 million\u2014reported heavy drinking, including 4.6 percent of males and 2.7 percent of females.\n\nPrevalence of Alcohol Use Among College Students", "639": "According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), about 620,000 Americans used heroin in 2010. But according to a new report commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, something like 1.5 million Americans were \"chronic heroin users\" that year. That group includes anyone who has consumed heroin on four or more days in the previous month.\n\nThis dramatic discrepancy results from the report's attempt to count heroin users missed by NSDUH, whether because they did not respond honestly, because they did not respond at all, or because they were not part of the household population sampled by the survey. To adjust for such undercounting, Beau Kilmer and eight other drug policy analysts at the RAND Corporation rely mainly on data from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM), which includes urinalysis as well as a survey. Because it focuses on arrestees, ADAM is more likely than NSDUH to identify heavy drug users. But its sample, unlike NSDUH's, is not nationally representative, so Kilmer and his colleagues must perform a series of calculations to convert ADAM numbers into total male arrestees testing postive for heroin and divide those users by frequency of use. Then they add estimates for men who were not arrested as well as for women and teenagers, based partly on NSDUH and information about overdoses, emergency room episodes, and treatment admissions.\n\nThe RAND researchers convert their estimate of heroin users into estimates of total consumption and spending. They use similar methods to estimate the size of the cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana markets. In the case of marijuana, a drug for which NSDUH seems to be a better guide, Kilmer et al. rely mainly on numbers from that survey, inflated by 25 percent and supplemented by ADAM data for respondents with criminal records. It is an impressive, headache-inducing feat, but one that is subject to \"great uncertainty\" because of the assumptions involved and the limits of the data, as the authors repeatedly acknowledge. \"In many cases,\" they say, \"the extent of the uncertainty cannot be bounded or quantified.\" They do not really know, for example, \"the extent to which one can trust arrestees' self-reports about their spending on illegal drugs\" or \"how to extrapolate just ten urban areas' arrest records to the country as a whole.\"\n\nThe RAND estimate for frequent heroin users is much higher than the one reported by NSDUH. In a recent USA Today op-ed piece, Kilmer and one of his collaborators, Jonathan Caulkins, say \"estimates from the 2010 NSDUH suggest there were only about 60,000 daily and near daily heroin users\"\u2014i.e., people who used heroin on 21 or more days in the previous month. They argue that \"the real number is closer to 1 million.\"\n\nYet whether you look at NSDUH data or at the RAND estimates, the trend from 2000 through 2010 looks similar. \"Heroin consumption remained fairly stable throughout the decade,\" Kilmer et al. write, \"although there is some evidence of an increase in the later years.\" They note that \"there was a steady increase in the amount of heroin seized within the United States and at the southwest border from 2007 through 2010,\" but they caution that seizure levels may reflect enforcement efforts and traffickers' tactics rather than consumption. The RAND estimates of heroin consumption indicate \"essentially no change\" from 2000 to 2010. The report does not cover the two subsequent years, when NSDUH reported an increase in the number of past-month heroin users, from 239,000 in 2010 to 335,000 in 2012.\n\nThe trends for the other drugs are also similar to what the NSDUH data suggest. \"Multiple indicators are consistent with an increasing trend in meth consumption over the first half of the decade and a subsequent decline through 2008,\" Kilmer et al. write. \"From 2002 to 2010, the amount of marijuana consumed in the United States likely increased by about 40 percent while the amount of cocaine consumed in the United States decreased by about 50 percent.\" Throughout the period covered by the report, estimated annual spending on the four drugs in the United States totaled about $100 billion, although the breakdown changed substantially. \"In 2000,\" say the RAND researchers, \"much more money was spent on cocaine than marijuana; in 2010 the opposite was true.\"\n\n[cross-posted at Hit & Run]", "640": "Lines are out, joints are in: Cocaine use in U.S. cut in HALF while marijuana use jumps 30 per cent\n\nThe spike in marijuana use and decline of cocaine was noted in a report published by the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy\n\n\n\nHeroin use remained stable while a spike in meth use at the beginning of the decade was followed by a steady decline\n\nThe study also found that Americans spent $1trillion on illicit drugs between 2000 and 2010\n\n\n\nUppers are down and downers are up, according to a new report on American drug use.\n\n\n\nBetween 2006 and 2010, use of cocaine in the U.S. has dropped by half while marijuana use has increased an astonishing 30 per cent.\n\n\n\nUse of heroin on the other hand has remained fairly stable, while methamphetamine use has been on the decrease since seeing a huge spike at the beginning of the decade.\n\n\n\nChange of habit: Between 2006 and 2010, cocaine use in the U.S. dropped by half\n\nThe new report was published by the White House's Office of National Drug Policy which is affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center and draws on data between 2000 and 2010.\n\n\n\nEach year, the National Drug Policy office totals how much Americans spend on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and meth while also estimating the number of chronic users.\n\n\n\n'Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,' said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Police Research Center. That's an average of $100billion a year.\n\n\n\nThe report does not attempt to explain changes in drug use or the impact of drug control strategies.\n\n\n\nHowever, the dramatic increase in marijuana use may be attributed to the fact that there was an increase in people who reported daily or near-daily use of weed in recent years.\n\n\n\nNew vice: Meanwhile, marijuana use went up 30 per cent and may be attributed to more users using the substance on a daily or near-daily basis\n\nData on marijuana use was mostly taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health while statistics on the other three drugs comes from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM).\n\n\n\nFederal funding for ADAM was ha lted this year, which may mean less-reliable data in the future.\n\n", "641": "U.S. Cocaine Consumption Declines by Half, While Marijuana Use Jumps\n\nStudying illegal drug use nationally from 2000 to 2010, researchers found the amount of marijuana consumed by Americans increased by more than 30 percent from 2006 to 2010, while cocaine consumption fell by about half. Meanwhile, heroin use was fairly stable throughout the decade.\n\nMethamphetamine consumption dramatically increased during the first half of the decade and then declined, but researchers did not have enough information to make a credible estimate of the drug\u2019s use from 2008 to 2010.\n\nThe findings come from a report compiled for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy by researchers affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center.\n\n\u201cHaving credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,\u201d said Beau Kilmer, the study\u2019s lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. \u201cThis work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.\u201d\n\nBecause the project only generated estimates through 2010, researchers say the report does not address the recent reported spike in heroin use or the consequences of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. The report also does not try to explain the causes behind changes in drug use or evaluate the effectiveness of drug control strategies.\n\nThe study, published on the website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, provides estimates of the amount of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine used each year from 2000 to 2010. The study includes estimates of retail spending on illicit drugs and the number of chronic users, who account for a majority of drug consumption.\n\nResearchers say that drug users in the United States spent on the order of $100 billion annually on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine throughout the decade. While the amount remained stable from 2000 to 2010, the spending shifted. While much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, the opposite was true by 2010.\n\n\u201cOur analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nThe surge in marijuana use appears to be related to an increase in the number of people who reported using the drug on a daily or near-daily basis.\n\nThe estimates for marijuana are rooted in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which surveys nearly 70,000 individuals each year. Estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are largely based on information from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM. The final estimates also incorporated information from other data sources\n\nHowever, since the federal government recently halted funding for ADAM, researchers say it will be considerably harder to track the abuse of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine in the future.\n\n\u201cThe ADAM program provided unique insights about those who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances,\u201d said Jonathan Caulkins, a study co-author and the Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that 2013 was the last year for ADAM. It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.\u201d\n\nTo improve future estimates, the report recommends investments in programs like ADAM that collect detailed data from heavy users. It also recommends that federal agencies revise some of the questions on existing self-report surveys.\n\nThe study, \u201cWhat America\u2019s Users Spend on Illegal Drugs, 2000\u20132010,\u201d can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp. Other authors of the report are Susan Everingham, Greg Midgette, Rosalie Pacula, Rachel Burns, Bing Han and Russell Lundberg, all of RAND, and Peter Reuter of the University of Maryland.\n\nSince 1989, the RAND Drug Policy Research Center has conducted research to help policymakers in the United States and throughout the world address issues involving alcohol and other drugs. In doing so, the center brings an objective and data-driven perspective to an often emotional and fractious policy arena.", "642": "Americans are using less cocaine and more marijuana than before, according to new data on illegal US drug use.\n\nPulling from numerous national studies, data on illegal drug use were collected nationwide from 2000 to 2010 as part of a study done for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Between 2006-2010, cocaine use was cut in half across the US, while the same time period revealed a 30 percent increase in marijuana use.\n\nHeroin use remained stable throughout the decade, the study found. Consumption of methamphetamine rose sharply during the first half of the decade before declining, but end-of-decade data on meth-use was not solid enough for researchers to make definitive statement on the overall trend for the decade.\n\nThroughout the decade, Americans spent $100 billion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine every year, according to the study, which is published on the Office of National Drug Control Policy's website. While the sum of money spent annually on illegal drugs stayed the same throughout the decade, the drugs the money was spent on changed, the researchers found.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than $1 trillion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,\" said lead study author Beau Kilmer, co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center.\n\nBecause the study only ran through 2010, researchers said Colorado and Washington state's recent legalization of marijuana for recreational use was not factored in, nor was a recent spike in heroin use.\n\nStill, the data will be valuable for policy makers, drug treatment centers and researchers, the study authors said.\n\n\"Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,\" Kilmer said. \"This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.\"\n\nThe researchers said that similar and more accurate studies in the future will be more difficult now that the government has canceled the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM).

The truth is quite different. Less than a million Americans lack health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. And it turns out that a good number of Americans are uninsured not because they are sick, but because they are convicted criminals.\n\nWhen Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that half of the law\u2019s expansion of health insurance coverage would come from expanding Medicaid, America\u2019s government-run health insurance program for the poor. However, in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could decline to expand their Medicaid programs; thus far, 25 states have held off. As the debate continues in those holdout states, one data point has gotten almost no attention.\n\nIt turns out that more than a third of the U.S. population eligible for the Medicaid expansion are ex-cons. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice estimated that \u201cat least 35 percent of new Medicaid eligibles under the Affordable Care Act will have a history of criminal involvement.\u201d\n\nThey arrived at this number by noting that approximately 10 million Americans are either in jail or released from prison each year; if approximately 60 percent of these individuals are uninsured enrollees in the appropriate income range, and the Medicaid expansion was originally estimated to cover 16 million people, then more than 35 percent of the Medicaid expansion population is comprised of convicted criminals.\n\nYesterday, in a front-page story in the New York Times, Erica Goode described the impact of Medicaid on the prison population. Medicaid\u2019s \u201cmost important benefit,\u201d according to corrections officials, \u201cis that inmates who are enrolled in Medicaid while in jail or prison can have coverage after they get out. People coming out of jail or prison have disproportionately high rates of chronic diseases, especially mental illness and addictive disorders\u2026many would qualify for Medicaid\u201d under Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the program.\n\nDefenders of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion argue that it\u2019s a good thing that ex-convicts can get Medicaid coverage, because it might help them stay out of jail. \u201cIf they go off their medication, oftentimes it can once again lead to more criminal activity,\u201d asserted Rick Raemisch, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, to Erica Goode.\n\nReal-world data to assess this hypothesis is mixed, but it\u2019s a hypothesis that can\u2019t be dismissed out of hand. It\u2019s certainly true that policy reformers of all stripes should give some thought as to how best to prevent ex-cons from returning to crime.\n\nBut Medicaid is an especially expensive, and inefficient, and ineffective program rife with waste, fraud, and abuse. You can be sure that there are plenty of taxpayers who work hard and play by the rules, who are wondering why they should pay more in taxes for this purpose. It's certainly not what they were told they were paying for when Obamacare was passed.\n\n* * *\n\nREAD AVIK\u2019S NEW BOOK, How Medicaid Fails the Poor (Encounter, 2013), available at Amazon and other major retailers.

That's well over the target of 19,000 spelled out in a Sept. 5 memo to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n\n\nNationally, nearly 4.2 million people have signed up for private insurance under the health care law.

Nearly three-quarters have gotten financial help.\n\n\n\nAmong those who signed up in February was Judy Rappe, 59, of Conway, who had gone without insurance since 2012, when her husband had to stop working after a serious car accident. Rappe said a program through her local hospital has helped pay for her prescriptions, but she was unable to afford an insurance policy until she found one through the new marketplace.\n\n\n\nRappe, who describes herself as \"not computer-literate at all,\" met with a marketplace assister at her local library to explore her options and enroll in a plan.\n\n\n\n\"Because of all the horror stories I'd seen on the news, I was very surprised it went so smooth,\" she said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHer new policy will cost her $30 a month.\n\n\n\n\"It's a good feeling,\" she said. \"Now, I just need to call up the doctor and make some appointments.\"\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire opted not to set up its own marketplace and is partnering with the federal government to educate consumers and manage the health plans being offered. The state Executive Council is set to vote today on whether to allow the Insurance Department to accept a $2 million federal grant for continued plan management.\n\n\n\nFor now, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire is the only insurer offering health plans through the exchange, and it has faced criticism for excluding 10 of the state's 26 hospitals from its provider network.

Deb Sanderson of Chelsea. \u201cThis is the hand that we\u2019ve been dealt. We have a bad hand and worse hand and, for Maine, Medicaid expansion is the worse hand.\u201d\n\nMaine, one of six states that hasn\u2019t decided whether to expand Medicaid under the health care law, is gearing up for more debates on the topic Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats hope to get enough support for expansion to overturn a certain veto from Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who\u2019s rejected two previous attempts to pass the bill. But many Republicans remain staunchly opposed despite the inclusion of provisions designed to attract their votes, such as implementing managed care in the Medicaid program.\n\nRepublicans, whose opposition to Medicaid expansion has centered on the possibility of hefty future costs to the state, have recently shifted their focus to highlight that Mainers can instead get private plans for as little as $5 or $10 a month. Some lawmakers have even started handling out pamphlets and explaining to protesters about their options on the marketplace, also called an exchange.\n\nAs part of the health care law, the federal government pays for part of some plans on the marketplace through income-based tax credits or subsidies. In Maine, more than 25,000 residents have already picked plans, surpassing the goal of having 23,000 residents signed up by the end of the open enrollment period in March.\n\nBut Democrats and advocates point to the fact that those making roughly $12,000 a year won\u2019t get help to pay for plans on the exchange, which would be about 24,000 Mainers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. They criticized the Republican tactic to push such plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a desperate ploy at the 11th hour to appear to be concerned about the health care of 70,000 people,\u201d said Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick. Maine has the opportunity accept federal dollars that will not only provide health care coverage to all those who need it in Maine, but will also bring significant benefits to the state\u2019s economy, he said.\n\n\u201cIf this does not pass, I think going to be reflected on both as a bad human decision and a bad business decision,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t forgo this kind of money and there not be consequences for our economy.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for Medicaid expansion contend that the subsidies aren\u2019t a viable alternative for many low-income Mainers\n\nMany will likely be drawn to plans on the exchange that have the lowest monthly premiums, but those plans don\u2019t offer subsidies to help reduce the total out-of-pocket cost, said Sara Gagne-Holmes, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners. That means people who buy them will be on the hook for much higher costs when they seek care, she said.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Michael Thibodeau of Waldo is quick to say that Republicans are by no means support the health care law with their efforts. In fact, he questions whether the subsidies will be sustainable long term. They merely hope to point out what options Mainers have that won\u2019t result in continued dependence on a state-run program, he said.\n\n\u201cThis exists,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know for how long. But I think Mainers should take advantage of it while it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nShare", "660": "(Story updated at 5:20 p.m. ET.)\n\n\n\nHealth advocates are pushing the Obama administration to address widespread confusion about how the\n\n\n\nThe Treasury Department said in a rule issued in January that\n\n\n\nWithout formal guidance, \u201cthere is a great deal of confusion and misinformation among state policymakers and advocates regarding the impact a woman's pregnancy status has on her eligibility for Medicaid and/or premium tax credits,\u201d argues a\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows states to retain their current limited Medicaid benefits for pregnant women, even if they extend comprehensive Medicaid benefits to other low-income adults. Health advocates are pushing the Obama administration to address widespread confusion about how the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act affects coverage options for pregnant women.The Treasury Department said in a rule issued in January that Medicaid coverage that pays only for services related to pregnancies won't satisfy the law's \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d requirement. However, the IRS said it will not assess penalties for women enrolled in those limited plans for 2014, because it's possible they don't know the coverage does not meet the threshold.

The bill, proposed by Republican Rep. Noel Torpey, also would ask Medicaid participants to pay a premium of at least 1% of their income. During a March 10th hearing on the bill, St. Louis University law professor Sidney Watson and Joel Ferber, director of advocacy at the Legal Services for Eastern Missouri, told lawmakers were told that the Obama administration was unlikely to approve a waiver that includes the work-search requirement.

Rick Scott tried to convince his fellow Republicans to re-consider - and failed.\n\n\n\nNow Stout said it's up to people like her to lead the fight for expansion, an issue she argues isn't just about health but about fairness.\n\n\n\n\"You get rewarded for not working; you get punished for working,\" she said. \"I've found that out in so many ways.\n\n\n\nStout said the issue can all be fixed, if only lawmakers act.\n\n\n\nActivists said they plan to focus most of their attention on House Speaker Will Weatherford, who is leading the charge to reject the federal funds.", "663": "GOP Questions Medicaid Enrollment Estimates Source: Health IT Outcomes\n\nBy Christine Kern, contributing writer\n\nRepublicans say new analysis of Medicaid Enrollment may not be telling the whole truth\n\nNew research from Avalere Health estimates that between 2.4 million and 3.5 million Americans were newly enrolled in Medicaid from October through January as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to Modern Healthcare, the Obama administration has said that 8.9 million individuals are eligible for Medicare or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through state Medicaid agencies and state-run insurance exchanges, and an additional 1.2 million are Medicaid-eligible through HealthCare.gov.\n\nAccording to Avalere\u2019s website, these enrollment estimates were developed by comparing reported data on new enrollments from October through January to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The estimates include both individuals who are newly eligible for Medicaid as a result of states\u2019 expanding eligibility under the ACA and those who were previously eligible but newly enrolled due to greater awareness of coverage options (also known as the \u201cwoodwork\u201d population). Avalere\u2019s estimates remove individuals who would have been enrolled in Medicaid absent the ACA, including eligibility renewals in some states.\n\nAvalere's estimate includes Medicaid enrollment both through the federally run and state-run exchanges. Avalere compared the number of new Medicaid and CHIP applications from October through January to the average monthly number of applications submitted from July through September of 2013 as a control.\n\nAvalere\u2019s study indicated that as of Jan. 31, between 1.7 million and 2.7 million people were newly enrolled in the states that have expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, while 700,000 to 800,000 people were newly enrolled in the non-expansion states.\n\nThese numbers are being challenged by officials in the mostly Republican-led states relying on the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange to determine Medicaid eligibility, who argue the actual number of people who have successfully enrolled in their states may only be in the tens of thousands. Obamacare and the expansion of Medicare generally have been opposed by elected Republican officials in those states.\n\nModern Healthcare reports that Texas, for example, which has the highest percentage of uninsured in the country, has processed 6,703 Medicaid files for individuals received from the federal exchange, according to state Medicaid officials. However, of those, only 904 have been approved and enrolled for coverage. The rest were either already on Medicaid, not eligible, or didn't complete their applications. CMS says it has found 392,675 Texans to be eligible for Medicaid since the federal insurance exchange opened.\n\nOfficials in several Republican-led states relying on HealthCare.gov said they doubted enrollment figures in the non-expansion states were remotely close to the 1 million mark, including both new enrollees and people re-enrolling into the program through Healthcare.gov. State officials from Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, and Wyoming told Modern Healthcare the number of Medicaid applications from HealthCare.gov actually processed was very low, either because they aren't receiving them yet or because they are in a testing phase during which the CMS is sending them Medicaid applications to check on the connection between the federal and state databases. They say the CMS has told them not to make eligibility determinations until the testing process is completed.\n\nIdaho, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Maine have all received far fewer completed applications than the number of those estimated to be eligible. Tom Shanahan, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, reported, \u201cIdaho is not yet getting the enrollment numbers in Medicaid that were expected. We projected about 35,000 individuals to be eligible but not covered. As of today, the only new enrollments that can be counted are the 1,900 that have come from HealthCare.gov.\u201d", "664": "Proponents of expanding Medicaid in Florida must feel that the state's legislative leaders speak a different language than they. That's because, despite the potential to accept federal funding and provide medical insurance to more Floridians with low incomes, the Legislature has refused \u2014 over and over and over \u2014 to expand the state's participation in the program.\n\nProponents of expanding Medicaid in Florida must feel that the state's legislative leaders speak a different language than they.\n\nThat's because, despite the potential to accept federal funding and provide medical insurance to more Floridians with low incomes, the Legislature has refused \u2014 over and over and over \u2014 to expand the state's participation in the program.\n\nContinuing to call upon the Florida Legislature to expand Medicaid may seem to be a lost or desperate cause \u2014 but it is the right thing to do and, if enough residents and voters pressure their legislators, maybe they will budge.\n\nHalf of the states have agreed \u2014 under the terms of the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 to extend Medicaid coverage to residents earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nFor a single Floridian, that means an income up to $16,104.\n\nFor a family of four, it is up to $32,913.\n\nFlorida limits Medicaid coverage \u2014 with few exceptions \u2014 to seriously disabled residents, impoverished children and, in a few cases, their parents.\n\nMore than 800,000 adult Floridians who do not have children \u2014 and earn less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level ($11,670 for individuals) \u2014 don't qualify for Medicaid. They are stuck in a coverage gap.\n\nThe intransigence in Florida is attributable mainly to Speaker of the House Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel.\n\nHis position has prevailed even though Gov. Rick Scott, key business organizations, the League of Women Voters and the Florida Hospital Association vigorously support Medicaid expansion.\n\n\n\nFLORIDIANS SUPPORT EXPANSION\n\nWhat's more, a recent and credible public-opinion poll suggests that a strong majority of Florida voters supports Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe poll, conducted Feb. 27 to March 1 for the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida, found that 67 percent of voters are in favor.\n\nWeatherford has cited two chief reasons for his opposition:\n\nHe questions whether the federal government will fulfill its stated commitment to fund 100 percent of the costs of expansion during the first three years and 90 percent thereafter.\n\nHe believes that expansion of Medicaid will create greater \"dependency\" on government programs.\n\nThe sustainability of funding is a concern with any program, yet even Gov. Scott has said he's willing to test expansion for at least three years and, as noted, 25 states have made the move.\n\nAs for Weatherford's second concern, it insults Floridians who have jobs, but are caught in the coverage gap or can't afford even subsidized private insurance.\n\n\n\nDOUBLE STANDARD\n\nConsider this hypocrisy: Weatherford and his fellow members of the House earn $29,697 annually for working in the Legislature \u2014 even though they have other jobs.\n\nYet, last year, they paid just $8.34 for taxpayer-subsidized individual coverage or $30 a month to cover their families.\n\nThat amount is one-sixth of what Florida senators and most state employees pay, and one-tenth of what the average private-sector worker pays for insurance, reports the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFloridians who would qualify for Medicaid expansion \u2014 and just about everyone else in the state \u2014 would covet such a deal.\n\nIn 2012, negative publicity shamed the Florida Senate into raising its health-insurance costs to the same level that the average state worker pays \u2014 $50 a month for an individual policy and $180 a month for families, still a good deal.\n\nWeatherford said this about the House's failure to take similar action last year: \"We are aware of the differences in what House members pay compared to other state employees for health insurance and are looking forward to addressing it next session.\"\n\nWell, \"next session\" is the 60-day session that opened last week.\n\nOne should not begrudge legislators and state employees affordable health-care insurance.\n\nThey should do the same for Floridians whose incomes don't rise to the level that legislators are paid for part-time work.", "665": "As most are aware, the federal government, primarily through its Medicare program that pays healthcare costs of America\u2019s seniors, is the preeminent payer of healthcare in the United States. In addition, Medicaid, as administered by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, provides a limited safety net for Idaho\u2019s poor. As such, Medicaid is also a major payer in the healthcare market.\n\nFor a healthcare provider to be reimbursed for providing Medicare or Medicaid services, the provider must make sure that it satisfies certain requirements. If the provider fails to meet these conditions of payment\u2014even by mistake\u2014the provider is not entitled to receive the reimbursement.\n\nOccasionally, after receiving a Medicare or Medicaid payment, a provider may discover that the claim or a series of claims that it submitted did not meet the applicable conditions of payment. Perhaps a required medical record or hospital admission order is missing. Or maybe a required signature was not on the record. When this happens, the provider is required to proactively return the payment, known as an overpayment. This repayment obligation applies even when the provider simply made a mistake. Now more than ever, Idaho\u2019s healthcare providers are making repayments to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAs part of the healthcare reform in recent years, this repayment obligation has become more serious. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, added a provision requiring Medicare and Medicaid providers to report and return an overpayment within 60 days after the overpayment had been \u201cidentified.\u201d The most sobering part of this 60-day requirement is that if the provider does not make the repayment by the 60-day deadline, the provider may become liable for significant penalties and damages under the False Claims Act and potentially risk exclusion from further participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under the False Claims Act (FCA), a provider could be liable for a civil penalty of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, in addition to three times the amount of the damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim. While we are not aware of any FCA cases in Idaho relating to the 60-day rule, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Idaho prosecutes FCA cases against Medicare and Medicaid providers.\n\nSince this 60-day rule was passed in 2010, providers have struggled to determine when an overpayment has been \u201cidentified.\u201d In other words, when does the 60-day clock start ticking? While it is clear that the clock starts once the overpayment has been \u201cidentified,\u201d the ACA unfortunately did not define or explain when the overpayment has been \u201cidentified.\u201d Does the 60 days start from the moment the provider first learned of a potential overpayment by an anonymous tip, for example? Or does it start once the provider has conducted a thorough investigation to determine whether the potential overpayment is actually an overpayment? The statute does not answer these questions.\n\nIn February 2012, nearly two years after the 60-day rule was passed, the government finally provided some guidance about the rule. At that time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid, issued proposed regulations interpreting the rule.\n\nWhile CMS\u2019s proposed regulations provided some direction to providers about when the 60-day clock started, they did not answer all of the questions. An additional problem is that these proposed regulations have yet to be finalized, more than two years after their publication. CMS\u2019s delay in finalizing the regulations is likely due, at least in part, to the negative reaction they have received. For instance, one of the proposals that has been largely rejected by the healthcare industry is CMS\u2019s plan to increase the look-back period (the period during which Medicare claims remain subject to reopening and adjustment) to ten years\u2014a significant expansion over the reopening periods allowed by CMS\u2019s current regulations. With this enlarged lookback period, a provider would be responsible for investigating and determining if a potential overpayment\u2014even one that was the result of a simple mistake up to a decade ago\u2014was an overpayment. Not surprisingly, this ten-year lookback period proposal received a disapproving response from the healthcare industry.\n\nAt this time, what is the status of the 60-day repayment rule? Even though CMS has yet to finalize any regulations regarding the rule, and even though it may not be clear in many cases when an overpayment has been \u201cidentified\u201d\u2014and when the 60-day clock starts ticking\u2014providers still need to repay overpayments within the 60 days of when they are \u201cidentified\u201d to avoid liability under the False Claims Act. Needless to say, with only 60 days to make the repayment once the clock starts, when providers become aware that they have, or may have, received an overpayment, they should move quickly and cautiously.\n\nMr. Olson is a partner at Hawley Troxell and a member of the firm\u2019s health law group.

Roger Katz of Augusta and Thomas Saviello of Wilton. Their measure was designed to attract moderate Republican support by expanding MaineCare coverage but also imposing a managed care system on the entire program, which serves about 320,000 low-income residents.\n\nAdditional Photos\n\nDemocrats are expected to walk away from the Katz-Saviello bill if it doesn\u2019t gain enough support in early voting to overcome an anticipated veto by Gov. Paul LePage. Democrats would then shift their focus to a bill sponsored by House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, which would expand MaineCare without creating a managed care system. The Eves bill was endorsed Thursday by the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee in a straight party-line vote.\n\nDemocrats are not thrilled with the managed care component of the Katz-Saviello bill, which they viewed as a major policy concession.\n\nEither way, the expansion bills face stiff, if not unmovable, opposition. And Democrats appear to know it. On Friday, there wasn\u2019t a peep about Medicaid expansion in the Democrats\u2019 weekly radio address, a platform that would typically be used to build momentum in advance of looming House and Senate votes.\n\nTaxpayer-funded health care for more than 60,000 people and the economic vitality of some of the state\u2019s hospitals is on the line with the upcoming votes. Their fates will also be messaged in legislative and gubernatorial races.\n\nSome Democrats are promising an electoral reckoning for Republicans if expansion doesn\u2019t pass. Lawmakers and operatives have said privately that the issue is ready-made for the campaign, citing enthusiasm in the Democratic base and internal polls that show support from independent voters.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidates, backed by ads by Moveon.org and other progressive groups, have slammed Republican governors in Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Texas for not supporting expansion and denying health care to thousands of people.\n\nHowever, as we\u2019ve seen in Maine, public opinion on Medicaid hinges on how the issue is framed. In other states, Republicans have emphasized Medicaid expansion\u2019s connection with Obamacare, which had a disastrous roll-out.\n\nNational Republican pundits are predicting a popular revolt like the one in 2010 \u2013 the same year Gov. Paul LePage and Republicans swept the State House \u2013 if the health care law continues to falter.\n\nDemocrats are worried. Last week, the Obama administration announced that it was further delaying a provision in the law that would have required consumers to replace individual policies that don\u2019t meet Obamacare guidelines. The move was viewed as mostly political, an attempt to help Democrats in midterm races because it would prevent the cancellation of policies, and the accompanying bad press, at the apex of the election season.\n\nMaine Republicans have attached another pejorative to expansion \u2013 \u201cwelfare\u201d \u2013 for the double-whammy: \u201cObamacare\u2019s welfare expansion.\u201d The belief among Republicans is that a message utilizing one or both of those terms will boost their chances of success in November.\n\nThe battle against welfare is already a centerpiece of LePage\u2019s campaign, which has the advantage of playing to the governor\u2019s base of support in his three-way race for re-election with Democrat Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler.\n\nAfter all, if the governor can blame welfare for the proliferation of invasive green crabs on the Maine coast, as he did during the recent Fishermen\u2019s Forum, then he might be able to take credit for defeating \u201cObamacare\u2019s welfare expansion\u201d in November.\n\nBIG TENT\n\nThere was an ugly Twitter fight on the #mepolitics thread last week between Dan Demeritt, LePage\u2019s former communications director, and David Sorensen, the current communications director for the House Republican Office.\n\nAt issue: the official voice for Maine Republicans, apparently.\n\nDemeritt, who writes a column for the Maine Sunday Telegram every other week and is a political consultant, last week wrote that Maine Republicans should fold the debate over new federal emission standards for wood stoves into their candidate platforms.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Capitol Ticker blog for the Portland Press Herald noted that the LePage campaign had done just that by reposting on its Facebook page an item from the Maine Republican Party condemning the regulations and trying to link them to the Democratic candidate for governor, U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud. (The post said Michaud was taking orders from his \u201cpolitical commander,\u201d President Obama.)\n\nSome folks on Twitter quickly credited Demeritt for the idea, which prompted Sorensen to say doing so was a mistake, that it was an \u201cobvious issue\u201d to push. Demeritt conceded as much, but the discussion quickly turned nasty. Demeritt questioned why Sorensen was picking a fight with him on Twitter, telling him to grow up. Sorensen responded: \u201cYou\u2019re an untrustworthy bottom feeder, no credibility or access.\u201d He added that the Press Herald and Maine Public Broadcasting Network should can Demeritt as a Republican pundit.\n\nJason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, jumped in, describing Demeritt as a \u201cliberal GOP\u201d operative appointed by the media. A blogger for the Maine Heritage Policy Center added that going to Demeritt for \u201cconservative opinion is like looking for oranges on an apple tree.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind all the ill will?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but probably doesn\u2019t help that Demeritt is currently consulting for the Maine Medical Association, which supports Medicaid expansion.\n\nAlso, Demeritt ruffled some feathers when he was LePage\u2019s spokesman and there were signs that Republican operatives secretly played a part in forcing him out of the governor\u2019s office in 2011. He\u2019s long suspected it. Since then, he\u2019s tried to carve out a niche as a conservative opinion leader who writes and talks about politics from his perspective. He doesn\u2019t claim to represent the Maine Republican Party. However, there are some Republicans who think he should use his media platforms to amplify the party\u2019s sanctioned views or vacate the position so someone else can.\n\nThis desire is not confined to Republicans, by the way; Democrats prefer friendly, uncritical voices in the opinion pages, too.\n\nDemocrats just haven\u2019t aired their motives on Twitter.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler\n\nShare", "667": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2013 Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster \u2013 now running for governor -- dove straight into the health-care debate Saturday when he attacked his former Republican colleagues for opposing Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sakes,\u201d Koster declared. \u201cThey\u2019re just pissed that we stole it.\u201d\n\nKoster\u2019s audience included several hundred at this weekend\u2019s Democrat Days, the annual regional event that traditionally kicks off the party\u2019s campaign season leading up to this fall\u2019s election. He noted that the event was the first Democratic gathering he attended after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 and that he has shown up annually ever since.\n\nIn essence, Koster -- the featured speaker at Saturday's brunch -- said that the GOP\u2019s approach to health care, as well as public education and care of the elderly, boiled down to a single thesis: \u201cSurvival of the fittest.\u201d\n\n\"We Democrats believe in a basic bargain,\u201d he countered. \u201cOur children should be educated. Our sick should have medicine, and our seniors should never live in poverty.\u201d\n\nAlthough he touched on all three topics, the bulk of his speech centered on health care -- and how it influenced his decision to switch parties.\n\n\u201cThere may be no issue with which I disagree more with my former party than the issue of public health,\u201d Koster said, touching off repeated applause. \u201cOn issues of medical research, on access to contraception, on expansion of health care to low- and moderate-income citizens\u2026I am still frustrated by my former party\u2019s 1950s-style public-health policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur job as Democrats is to speak clearly on this issue,\u2019\u2019 he continued. \u201cI left the Republican Party over their foolishness on health care... Now, the Hospital Association has left them, the Chambers of Commerce of this state has left them. For god\u2019s sake, even Kit Bond has left them.\u201d\n\nBond, a former Republican governor and U.S. senator, has been hired by business groups to persuade resistant Republican lawmakers to expand Medicaid in Missouri. The federal government would pay all the additional costs for the first three years and at least 90 percent thereafter. Opponents say the state's costs would still be too high. Many conservatives also oppose expanding the government's role in health care.\n\nRural Missouri and Medicaid expansion\n\nKoster\u2019s call for Democrats to highlight proudly their support of the federal health insurance law was particularly stunning because many national Democrats, and some in Missouri, have been skittish about it. They believe that the congressional battle several years over the Affordable Care Act contributed to the Democratic election losses nationally and in Missouri in 2010.\n\nSome Republicans believe that emphasizing their continued opposition to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion could help the GOP this fall.\n\nKoster, however, disagreed. And in Hannibal he appeared to have company from fellow Democrats who said that rural voters \u2013 who generally now vote Republican \u2013 are coming around on Medicaid, in part because of rural hospitals\u2019 warnings of cutbacks or closings if the expansion is rejected.\n\nThe money from the expansion is to replace the federal money, soon to be cut, that hospitals now receive for caring for the uninsured. Rural hospitals, in particular, say they may not survive without federal help.\n\n\u201cThe rural hospitals are suffering,\u2019\u2019 said John Yancy, a longtime organizer of Democrat Days and a member of the local county Democratic committee. That view was echoed by virtually all Democratic attendees asked to name their top issue.\n\nGOP focused on Obama?\n\nKoster said in an interview that he was simply in line with Gov. Jay Nixon, a fellow Democrat, who has lobbied for expansion since shortly after winning re-election late 2012. But there is a difference; Koster is espousing the issue before an election, not after.\n\nAmong other things, Koster accused the state\u2019s Republican leaders of embracing \u201cthe same angry stubbornness\u201d that the GOP espoused in its failed legislative efforts in 2005 to ban certain stem cell research. That led to the narrow statewide passage in 2006 of a constitutional amendment protecting such research.\n\nExpanding Medicaid coverage to roughly 300,000 more Missourians would do more than just improve their health, Koster went on.\n\n\u201cPut aside the lives that this will save. Put aside the healthy outcomes that will result. Put aside the emergency room visits that never should occur,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThis expansion proposal is still the best darn economic development proposal that this state has seen in the last 25 years.\u201d\n\nHe cited health experts\u2019 estimates that Medicaid expansion would bring 24,000 new jobs to the state, as well as the $8 billion in promised federal money over six years.\n\nKoster then concluded, \u201cAnd for no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of expansion simply to spite a president.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate for state auditor\n\nFor all the focus on health care, Missouri Democrats in Hannibal seemed to spend little time discussing a key party problem as it heads into the fall. With only two weeks left for candidate filing, the Democrats have yet to find a prominent figure to run for state auditor, challenging Republican incumbent Tom Schweich.\n\nState Democratic Party Roy Temple said earlier that he wasn\u2019t focused on the matter. And that appears to also be the case for many rank and file Democrats.\n\nThose in Hannibal seemed more interested in discussing how the party can best cut into the huge edge that Republicans now hold in the Missouri House and Senate. That majority has been built largely by GOP success in decimating the Democratic ranks in rural Missouri.\n\nState Rep. Ed Schieffer, D-Troy, introduced himself Saturday as \u201cthe last Democrat in the Missouri House from northeast Missouri.\u201d His few remaining colleagues were ousted in 2012.\n\nSchieffer is now running for the state Senate and says he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d \u2013 in part because of the issue of Medicaid expansion.\n\nAs for state auditor, some Democrats were privately contending that Koster -- who now wields significant behind-the-scenes power in state Democratic politics -- opposes mounting a strong challenger to Schweich and is discouraging any major Democrats from filing.\n\nThey said that Koster would rather run against Schweich for governor in 2016 and would like to see him well-funded for a possible primary battle against former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, a Republican from St. Louis County who recently announced she\u2019s running for governor.\n\nIn an interview, Koster dismissed such talk as \u201coverly complicated political gossip.\u201d", "668": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2013 Chris Koster came to Hannibal for the annual Democrat Days gathering seven years ago this weekend as a first-time Democrat.\n\n\n\nIt was the then-Repbulican state senator\u2019s first large Democratic gathering after announcing his switch from the Republican Party, and he said he was nervous. So nervous, he brought his mom.\n\nThe wariness that he may have faced during his first trip to Democrat Days was nowhere to be found this year, as attendees rushed to grab photos with the state\u2019s now second-term attorney general and encouraging him as he readies to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2016. Here in Hannibal and elsewhere on the campaign trail, Koster does not shy from talking about his party switch. And when he brings it up, he gets cheers.\n\nSpeaking here on Saturday as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee for governor in 2016, Koster said the same issues that brought him to Hannibal after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 are the issues that the state is facing, yet again, in 2014.\n\n\u201cI quit my party over a disagreement over public health,\u201d he told Democrats gathered for an annual brunch.\n\nKoster touted his support of the 2010 federal health care law, noting new access to contraceptive services for women and a provision barring insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Koster questioned why Republicans were against the policy, parts of which were first pitched by conservative groups in the 1990\u2019s as an alternative to then-First Lady Hilary Clinton\u2019s health care proposal.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest to god Republican idea, they\u2019re just pissed we stole it.\u201d\n\nKoster said perhaps his biggest frustration with his former party\u2019s health care positioning now is its opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThis expansion proposal is the best darn economic development proposal this state has seen in the last 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of expansion simply to spite a president.\u201d\n\nKoster noted support from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican who was a vocal opponent of the 2010 health care law, which was passed during his final year in the Senate. Koster said the potential economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are undeniable.\n\n\u201cThe bill has been passed. Sen. Bond is walking the halls trying to convince Democrats and Republicans to accept $2 billion,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you had $2 billion dollars sitting on your front door, wouldn\u2019t you take it?\u201d\n\nOne reason Republicans offer is broad public opposition in Missouri and elsewhere to the federal health care law. When different provisions of the law have been on the ballot, Missourians have overwhelmingly opposed them.

Secretary of State Jason Kander was scheduled to speak Saturday evening to the annual dinner.", "669": "One of the co-authors of a recent study promising to revolutionize the synthesis of stem cells has called for the entire research to be retracted after he reviewed the test data and reportedly found multiple problems, including \u201cquestionable images.\u201d\n\nOne of the co-authors of the joint Japanese/American research, Professor Teruhiko Wakayama of Yamanashi University, has decided to carefully review his team\u2019s study on the creation of stem cells (cells that can grow into any type of organ or tissue). This followed claims by science colleagues that the erroneous image data was used for the article published in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cI have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation,\u201d Wakayama told NHK. \u201cTo check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.\u201d\n\n\"When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right,\" Wakayama said, adding that if it turns out to be wrong, it would be essential to make it clear why a thing like that could have happened.\n\nThe leader of the research team, Japanese researcher Haruko Obokata together with US scientists announced a breakthrough in January: a cheap way to produce valuable embryonic-like stem cells without having to terminate any embryos. The study promised to usher in a new era in stem cell biology, as the prominence of stem cell use grew with the realization of just how much we could accomplish in the way of battling a huge variety of diseases. This is because of the cells\u2019 ability to mimic other cells in the body.\n\nWhat Obokata from the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan and researchers from the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH) allegedly found at the time was that an adult cell (also known as a \u201csomatic\u201d cell) had the potential to transform into a copy of an embryonic stem cell as a result of a simple process. The scientists subjected cells to external stress, \"almost to the point of death\u201d, by exposing them to various hostile environments, for instance, acid or low oxygen. Within a few days the cells (called Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells) survived and recovered from the stressful stimulus by naturally reverting into a state that is equivalent to an embryonic stem cell, the researchers said.\n\nWithin weeks of its publication on January 29, the study faced criticism of irregularities in visual data and allegedly duplicated imagery. Added to that was the problem some scientists were having trouble reproducing the \u2018simple\u2019 technique promised by researchers doing the study.\n\nWakayama was in charge of the part of the experiment that checked if the cells had acquired pluripotency \u2013 the ability to shift properties to those resembling an embryo cell. He said a change in a specific gene was to be proof. He pointed out that after RIKEN disclosed detailed procedures for making STAP cells, in the newly released procedures RIKEN says this change didn't take place, NHK reported.\n\nRIKEN said it has launched an independent investigation in the content of the paper. Nature has responded promptly with its own probe. In an e-mailed statement, the journal said: \"Issues relating to this paper have been brought to Nature's attention and we are conducting an ongoing investigation. We have no further comment at this stage.\"\n\nBut not all believe that mistakes were made; among them is Hitoshi Niwa, who also contributed to the article in Nature sees the hiccups with the picture data as only \u201cminor mistakes,\u201d according to Japanese media. Joining him is Charles Vanati, a tissue engineer with Harvard Medical School and BWH, who told The Wall Street Journal that \u201cbased on the information I have, I see no reason why these papers should be retracted\u2026 it would be very sad to have such an important paper retracted as a result of peer pressure, when indeed the data and conclusions are honest and valid.\u201d", "670": "After claiming to have developed a novel technique for coaxing the growth of stem cells in an acid bath, Japanese researchers have come under scrutiny for apparent irregularities.

More importantly, nobody could replicate the results claimed by the team, one led by Haruko Obokata of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan. But now, as Nature News reports, two more serious problems have emerged.\n\nFirst, the paper was found to contain two images that appear to have been duplicated from Obokata's doctoral dissertation. What's more, the study described experiments with cells in an embryonic state, but the cells reported in the paper were said to be derived from an entirely different process from a different experiment. Ouch.\n\nSecond, there's the recent admission from Teruhiko Wakayama, a cloning expert at Yamanashi University and a corresponding author on one of the papers. From Nature News:\n\nInterviewed by NHK news, Wakayama said: \"I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation.\" Wakayama calls for an investigation of all the laboratory notebooks and data. He continues: \"To check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.\" Wakayama reportedly contacted all of the authors requesting that they agree to retract the paper. RIKEN says it is still investigating the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is awful, and not just because of potential impropriety or sloppiness. As Wakayama notes, the paper could actually be correct.

A lot.\u201d\n\nIn a series of emotionally wrenching interviews with the writer Andrew Solomon, Lanza detailed his son\u2019s medical history and increasing isolation, his ex-wife\u2019s struggle to deal with their troubled child, and his own role as the father of the person who committed one of the worst mass shootings in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nSolomon, the author of the book \u201cFar From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity,\u201d recounts the interviews in an article in this week\u2019s issue of The New Yorker magazine.\n\nAdam Lanza, 20, shot his mother, Nancy, before going on his shooting rampage at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, and then shot himself just as the police were arriving at the elementary school.\n\nPeter Lanza\u2019s account confirms the basic portrait that emerged from the investigation, and adds new details as well as a deeper understanding of how he and Adam\u2019s mother struggled to understand and care for their son. Lanza described Adam\u2019s behavior as a child as \u201cweird\u201d but never dangerous. He said that the first official diagnosis they received concerning Adam\u2019s mental health came when he was 13.\n\nThe diagnosis was Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a category that the American Psychiatric Association has since subsumed into the broader diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Adam refused to accept that he had the disorder.\n\nPeter Lanza said that the diagnosis might have kept them from realizing the danger their son posed.\n\n\u2014Marc Santora, The New York Times\n\nReport cites \u2018devastating toll\u2019 on health of Syria\u2019s children\n\nThe Syrian civil war\u2019s effect on the health of Syria\u2019s children is far more insidious than has been widely understood, a leading children\u2019s advocacy group reported Sunday, with large numbers dying or at risk from chronic and preventable diseases that have flourished because the country\u2019s public health system has basically collapsed.\n\nIn a report timed to coincide with the beginning of the fourth year of the conflict, the group, Save the Children, said the effects of untreated illnesses on Syrian children were only partly reflected in the documented statistics.\n\nThey show that at least 1.2 million children have fled to neighboring countries, that 4.3 million in Syria need humanitarian assistance and that more than 10,000 have died in the violence.\n\n\u201cIt is not just the bullets and the shells that are killing and maiming children,\u201d said the report, \u201cA Devastating Toll.\u201d The conflict, which began in March 2011, has left a \u201cshattered health system resulting in brutal medical practices that have left millions of children suffering,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report asserted that \u201cseveral thousands of children\u201d had died because of greatly reduced access to treatment for diseases including cancer, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure. The report is based partly on conclusions drawn from data that has been issued by other organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health Organization, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Doctors Without Borders, and other medical research, as well as from the Syrian government.\n\nBut the report also draws on Save the Children\u2019s own research, including interviews with Syrian children, parents and medical providers who painted what amounted to a portrait of medieval health conditions.\n\n\u2014Rick Gladstone, The New York Times", "681": "TOKYO/LONDON - A Japanese scientist called on Monday for his own headline-grabbing study on stem cells to be withdrawn from publication, saying its findings had now been thrown into too much doubt.\n\nThe research -- hailed when it came out in January as a breakthrough that could herald a new era of medical biology -- was covered widely in Japan and across the world after it was published in the highly reputable science journal Nature.\n\nBut since then, there have been reports that other scientists have been unable to replicate the Japanese team's results and that there may have been problems with its data and images.\n\n\"It is no longer clear what is right,\" Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor at Japan's University of Yamanashi who was part of the researcher team, told public broadcaster NHK.\n\nThe study, described as game changing by independent experts asked to comment on it when it was published, appeared to show a simple way to reprogram mature animal cells back into an embryonic-like state that would allow them to generate many types of tissue.\n\nThe results appeared to offer a promise that human cells might in future be simply and cheaply reprogrammed back into embryonic cell-like cells - in this case cells dubbed Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells -- suggesting a simple way to replace damaged cells or grow new organs for sick and injured people.\n\n\"When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right,\" Wakayama said.\n\n\"But now that many mistakes have emerged, I think it is best to withdraw the research paper once and, using correct data and correct pictures, to prove once again the paper is right.

Within days, the scientists said they had found that the cells had not only survived but had also recovered by naturally reverting into a state similar to that of an embryonic stem cell.\n\nYet no other research team has yet been able to replicate the findings, and the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan, where Obokata works, said last week it had \"launched an independent inquiry into the content of the paper.\n\nThat inquiry would be conducted by a panel of experts from within and outside RIKEN, it said, and would be published as soon as it was concluded.\n\nA RIKEN spokesman declined to comment on Wakayama's call for the paper to be withdrawn.", "682": "According to Japanese news reports, a respected scientist and co-author of two high-profile papers that described a controversial technique for creating stem cells has called for the studies to be withdrawn because of errors.\n\nFor weeks, the papers published in the journal Nature by a team of Boston and Japanese scientists have been under intense scrutiny, which has revealed problems with some of the images and an allegation of plagiarism in the Methods section of one of the papers.\n\nThe researcher who is calling for the retraction, Teruhiko Wakayama, is a highly-respected stem cell scientist who was the first to clone a mouse.

It was an effort to clarify a situation that has been increasingly murky, because of doubts raised about whether the work was repeatable. Even Wakayama told Nature News that although he was able to do the procedure successfully once, with help from the lead author, Haruko Obokata, he has not since been able to repeat the experiment on his own.\n\nBut the protocol itself raised many questions. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist at the University of California, Davis, whose blog has become a resource for information about the technique, described what appeared to be contradictions and red flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakayama told NHK World that his review of data brought to meetings revealed many serious problems, including some with images.

Numerous scientists also had difficulty reproducing the supposedly simple method. The team responded with the promise of corrections and a list of tips to help other scientists to reproduce the results.\n\nOver the weekend, however, two more serious problems surfaced. The Nature paper was found to contain two images apparently duplicated from Obokata\u2019s doctoral dissertation. Her thesis also reported experiments dealing with cells that were supposedly in an embryonic state, but the cells reported in the Nature paper were said to be derived from a different process in an altogether different experiment.\n\nThe revelation has led to a flurry of calls \u2014 including some from senior scientists in Japan \u2014 for the paper to be retracted.\n\nPerhaps the most damning comes from Teruhiko Wakayama, a cloning expert at Yamanashi University and a corresponding author on one of the papers. Interviewed by NHK news, Wakayama said: \u201cI have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation.\u201d Wakayama calls for an investigation of all the laboratory notebooks and data.

RIKEN says it is still investigating the case.", "684": "A new study suggests light alcohol consumption during the first trimester is linked to a higher risk of bearing a preterm or unexpectedly small baby, even if expectant mothers keep within the government-recommended limit of two units a week.\n\nIn addition, say researchers at the University of Leeds in the UK, who report their findings in the BMJ's Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, drinking alcohol in the weeks leading up to conception is also linked to smaller fetal growth.\n\nThe new finding adds to a debate, fueled by mixed evidence, that has been going on for some time about light alcohol consumption in pregnancy.\n\nThe authors note that when pregnant women drink alcohol, it crosses the placenta and results in nearly equal cocentrations in both the fetus and the mother.\n\nHowever, while the effects of heavy drinking in pregnancy are well established, the effect of light drinking is not, and different studies have come to different conclusions about it, as have different health authorities.\n\nVaried evidence and advice about light alcohol consumption in pregnancy\n\nFor example, in 2010, the same journal published a study led by University College London, which tracked children up to the age of 5 and found no evidence that light drinking in pregnancy harms children's development.\n\nBut in 2012, researchers in the US who were concerned about fetal alcohol syndrome - a range of growth, mental and physical abnormalities that can occur in babies whose mothers drink alcohol during pregnancy - said there was no safe limit for alcohol consumption in pregnancy. They described how they came to this conclusion in a paper published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.\n\nAnd then, a year later, another UK study published in BMJ Open looked at the effects drinking during pregnancy might have on fetal development and concluded that moderate alcohol consumption in pregnancy was safe.\n\nMeanwhile, American women are advised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that there is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy, and that women who are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant should refrain from drinking alcohol.\n\nThis is also the view of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which recommend universal screening for alcohol consumption for all pregnant women and women of childbearing age.\n\nThe UK's Department of Health advice is less strict. They recommend women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all, but if they choose to drink, then they should limit their consumption to one or two units, once or twice a week. That is no more than a pint of beer, or a medium glass of wine, twice a week.\n\nDrinking over two units a week ups chances of bearing preterm or small babies\n\nFor this latest study, the Leeds researchers examined data on 1,264 pregnant women in Leeds aged between 18 and 25 who were assessed to be at low risk for birth complications.\n\nAll the women were enrolled in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) Study, and had filled in food frequency questionnaires that asked them to specify how often they drank alcohol and of what type, 4 weeks before conception and during each trimester throughout their pregnancy.\n\nWhen their babies were born, 13% were underweight and 4.4% were smaller than would be expected, while a similar percentage (4.3%) were preterm.\n\nEven after taking into account other possible influencers, when they analyzed the alcohol data against the birth outcomes, the researchers found women who drank more than two units of alcohol per week were twice as likely to give birth to a premature or unexpectedly small baby than women who did not drink alcohol at all.\n\nBut the analysis showed that even women who did not drink more than the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of giving birth prematurely.\n\nPlus, drinking during the period leading up to conception was also associated with a risk of restricted fetal growth, suggesting this may also be a critical time, note the authors.\n\nDuring pregnancy, average intake was 11 units a week in first trimester\n\nThe data showed that on average, the women drank the most alcohol before conception and in the first trimester. During pregnancy, the average intake was 11 units a week in the first, four in the second, and just under two in the last trimester.\n\nMore than half (53%) of the moms-to-be drank more than two units a week in the first trimester, and nearly 40% said they drank more than 10 units a week in the weeks leading up to conception.\n\nThe study also found expectant mothers who were the most likely to drink more than the recommended limit of two units a week tended to be older, white, better educated and living in more affluent areas.\n\nSenior author Janet Cade, a professor in Leeds' School of Science and Food Nutrition, says:\n\n\"Since pregnancy is such a special time for women it would be sensible for anyone who is thinking about getting pregnant to avoid alcohol during that time.\"", "685": "LEEDS, England, March 11 (UPI) -- Pregnant women who drank more than two weekly units of alcohol were twice as likely to give birth to a small or premature baby, researchers in Britain say.\n\nA 15-ounce can of beer which is 4.5 percent alcohol is 2 units of alcohol, while a single shot of spirits is 1 unit of alcohol, explained the website www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/alcohol-units.aspx.\n\nProfessor Janet Cade of the University of Leeds' School of Science and Food Nutrition and colleagues linked women drinking alcohol -- just two weekly units of alcohol -- during the first three months of pregnancy to a higher risk of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby.\n\nThe research also found those who drank more than two units a week were more likely to be older, were college educated, of white ethnicity and more likely to live in affluent areas.\n\nRELATED Alcohol during pregnancy found to hurt IQ\n\nBritain's Department of Health recommends pregnant women, or those trying to conceive, to not drink alcohol at all.

Drinking alcohol during the period leading up to conception was also linked to a higher risk of lower fetal growth, Cade said.\n\nThe study involved 1,200 women in Leeds, England, at low risk of birth complications.

The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, was conducted by British researchers who surveyed the alcohol consumption habits of 1,264 women both prior to conception and during pregnancy. The women were participants in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health study, and all at low risk of birth complications.

About four out of 10 women admitted they drank more than 10 units a week while trying to conceive.\n\nThose who drank more than two units per week were more likely to be \"older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas,\" the news release reported.\n\nThe team found a significant link between alcohol consumption during the first three weeks of pregnancy and an increased risk of premature or underweight birth. Even women who did not exceed the recommended two units per week maximum still had an increased risk of these complications. Drinking while trying to conceive was also associated with \"restricted fetal growth.\"\n\n\"Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,\" the authors wrote, the news release reported.", "692": "Action Points In this study, nearly two-thirds of women before pregnancy and over half in the first trimester reported alcohol intakes above guidelines of \u22642 units/week.\n\nAssociations with adverse birth outcomes were strongest for intakes >2 units/week before pregnancy and in trimesters one and two compared with nondrinkers.\n\nHowever, even women adhering to the guidelines in the first trimester were at significantly higher risk of having babies with lower birth weight compared with nondrinkers.\n\nWomen who consumed low levels of alcohol before conception and during pregnancy were more likely to have adverse birth outcomes such as low birth centile, low birth weight, and premature birth than nondrinkers, a British study reported.\n\nIn the first trimester, consuming less than 2 units of alcohol per week was associated with an adjusted -5.8 (95% CI -10.8 to -0.7) decrease in customized birth centile compared with nondrinkers (P trend = 0.002), wrote Camilla Nykjaer, MSc, of the University of Leeds and her co-authors in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

(Customized birth centiles took into account maternal height, weight, ethnicity, parity, neonatal birth weight, and sex.\n\nThe adjusted odds ratios for small gestational age in the first trimester were 1.7 for those who drank less than 2 units a week (95% CI 0.9 to 3.1) and 2.0 for those who consumed more than two units a week compared with nondrinkers (95% CI 1.2 to 3.4, P trend = 0.03).\n\nThe low birth centile and small gestational age associations were \"attenuated\" in the second and third trimesters, the authors reported.\n\nThe adjusted odds ratios for giving birth prematurely were 4.6 for women who drank less than two units of alcohol a week (95% CI 1.4 to 14.7) and 3.5 for those who drank more than two units a week (95% CI 1.1 to 11.2), compared with nondrinkers, they added.\n\nThis association was \"nonsignificant\" in those who drank in the 4 weeks before conception and during the second and third trimester, the authors said.\n\nThe study included 1,264 pregnant women between 18 and 45 enrolled in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) Study. Their alcohol consumption was gauged based on questionnaires administered 4 weeks before conception and during each trimester.\n\nThe questionnaires asked how often participants drank alcohol and what forms of alcohol they drank. Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption was converted to times per week, which was then multiplied by the units of alcohol in each of the alcoholic beverages listed on the questionnaire to obtain weekly consumption in units.\n\nInformation on birth outcomes was obtained from hospital maternity records.\n\nThe researchers adjusted for caffeine and energy intake, as well as salivary cotinine levels.\n\nAlcohol crosses the placenta \"and results in nearly equal concentrations in the mother and fetus,\" the authors noted. But while the evidence regarding the damaging effects of heavy drinking in pregnancy has been well-established, results of studies of the impact of low levels of alcohol consumption on birth outcomes have been varied.\n\nThe lack of consensus on the impact of low levels of consumption has resulted in varying national policies with regard to alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the authors said.\n\nIn the U.S., the Surgeon General has advised women against drinking alcohol during pregnancy. In the U.K., where the study took place, the Department of Health recommends that pregnant women and those trying to conceive avoid alcohol or limit consumption to one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week.\n\nThe most recent U.K. Infant Feeding Survey (IFS), which included data from more than 15,000 women, indicated that 40% drank alcohol during their pregnancies, but that only 3% drank more than two units per week.\n\nIn this study, the proportion of women who reported drinking before and during pregnancy was considerably higher, the authors said. \"Nearly two-thirds of women before pregnancy and over half in the first trimester reported alcohol intakes above the Department of Health (U.K.) guidelines of \u22642 units/week,\" they wrote.\n\nThe IFS data was collected postpartum and might have been subject to under-reporting, the authors cautioned. The characteristics of drinking mothers in this study and the IFS survey were generally consistent, however -- women tended to be 35 or older, from managerial and professional occupations, and from a white ethnic background.\n\nOne potential weakness of the study was that it was designed to assess caffeine intake, not alcohol consumption. \"However, the questionnaire was validated with reference to caffeine intake and is comparable to other methods used in the assessment of alcohol,\" the authors said.\n\nThe study also suffered from low sample size in the third trimester.\n\n\"Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,\" the authors wrote.\n\nFuture studies should also take into account timing of exposure, the authors said. Maternal alcohol consumption usually decreases throughout pregnancy, they said. \"Therefore, averaging exposure measured at one time point in pregnancy to reflect exposure across the whole of pregnancy may obscure any true associations.\"\n\nThe CARE study was supported by a grant from the Food Standard Agency.

Despite these recommendations, the U.K. guidelines suggest that if women want to drink, having no more than one or two units, equivalent to about one pint, per week should be safe. However, according to a new study conducted in the UK, researches reported that drinking alcohol anytime before or after conception increases one's risk of giving birth preterm.\n\nFor this study, the researchers interviewed 1,264 female participants. They gathered information on the participants' drinking patterns before and after conception. They calculated that 53 percent of the women had consumed more than the recommended weekly amount of alcohol within the first trimester. Almost 40 percent of the women reported drinking more than 10 units per week before conception.\n\nThe researchers discovered that around 13 percent of the babies born to the study's participants were underweight. 4.4 percent of them were smaller than normal and 4.3 percent had been born preterm. The team estimated that women who drank more than two units within the first three months of pregnancy were two times more likely to give birth prematurely and to have a smaller than normal sized infant. The researchers also found that women who drank alcohol in general, even if the amount was below the limit of two units, were still more likely to have a premature or smaller infant than women who did not drink at all. The researcher reported the same relationship for women who drank more alcohol before conception.\n\n\"This is a very sensitive issue, we don't want women who are pregnant now to panic, the individual risk is actually low,\" Camilla Nykjaer, one of the researchers at the University of Leeds, told the BBC News. \"They shouldn't drink, they should stop drinking if they have been drinking during the pregnancy.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that the women who were more likely to drink over the recommended amounts of alcohol tended to be white, older and more educated. They also resided in wealthier neighborhoods.\n\n\"While the safest approach would be to choose not to drink at all, small amounts of alcohol, not more than one to two units once or twice a week, have not been shown to be harmful after 12 weeks of pregnancy,\" Dr. Patrick O'Brien, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said. \"Pregnant women should always consult their midwives or doctors if they have any concerns about their alcohol intake.\"\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.\n\nSee Now: What Republicans Don't Want You To Know About Obamacare", "695": "Few things attract such disparaging glares as a pregnant woman sidling up to the bar and ordering a martini.

A unit is defined as 10 ml of pure alcohol, one to two units is equivalent to a glass of wine.\n\nWhat the researchers found was that more than 50 percent of women in the white-affluent-educated socioeconomic class drank, on average, four units a week in their first trimester and only went down to two units or less in the second.

an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who drank no alcohol at all.\n\nBut even women who didn\u2019t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake at this time were still more likely to have a premature birth.\n\nDrinking in the month before conception was also linked to a higher risk of restricted fetal growth, indicating this may also be a critical period, it says.\n\nDr Nykjaer said \u2018We found the first trimester to be the period most sensitive to the effect of alcohol on the developing fetus.\n\n\u2018Women adhering to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.\n\nAfter the first three months, drinking alcohol has less effect on the growth of the baby\n\n\u2018Although the Department of Health advises avoiding alcohol, the guidelines do give a bit of leeway and our research supports abstinence\u2019 she added.\n\nThe issue of how much is safe to drink during pregnancy has caused controversy in recent years.\n\nIn 2007, the Department of Health published guidance saying pregnant women should avoid drinking alcohol altogether, as should those trying to conceive.\n\nSuch women should never drink more than one or two units once or twice a week, it says.\n\nThis replaced previous guidance which said it was safe for pregnant women to drink one to two units of alcohol per week.\n\nThe Government said its update was not based on new research, but was to provide consistent advice to all women.\n\nDrinking in the month before conception was also found to restrict fetal growth\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also advises women to avoid alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy.\n\nHeavy drinking in pregnancy is linked to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in children, which can cause a range of physical, mental and behavioural problems.\n\nDr Nykjaer stressed that pregnant women should not be scared by the findings.\n\nShe said \u2018We have found an effect in a population of women that helps reinforce guidelines but the effect in an individual woman would be quite small.\u2019 She said women in the study may have under-reported their drinking because of the \u2018taboo\u2019 surrounding alcohol and pregnancy.\n\nAs a result the effect on prematurity and growth may have come from larger intakes of alcohol than the study suggested, she said.\n\nProf Andrew Whitelaw, Professor of Neonatal Medicine, University of Bristol, said \u2018This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth.\n\n\u2018As 38 per cent of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.\u2019\n\n\n\nDr Ron Gray, Senior Clinical Research Fellow, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of

surveyed more than 1,200 pregnant women in the city of Leeds who were at low risk of birth complications, asking them about their drinking habits during each trimester of pregnancy. Slightly more than half reported downing more than the two-drink maximum recommended by scientists, with four in 10 reporting consumption of 10 or more alcoholic drinks per week in the leadup to conception.\n\nOverall, alcohol consumption fell after the first trimester, as women grew into their pregnancies. Women in the study began their first trimesters drinking 11 standard units of alcohol per week, which fell to four drinks and then just under two during the second and third trimesters, respectively.\n\nNot surprisingly, older educated white women with higher socioeconomic status drank the most, supporting previous study showing a greater propensity for drink among the more affluent. Of babies born to the women in the study, 13 percent were underweight while 4.4 percent were a bit on the small side. Four-point-three percent were born prematurely. All of those adverse outcomes were strongly linked to alcohol consumption among the pregnant mothers.\n\nConversely, Yvonne and her colleagues found no behavioral or cognitive problems among 5-year-olds born to mothers in the cohort study, but did find a higher incidence among even mothers who\u2019d drank lightly, adhering to the government\u2019s two-drink per week maximum. Early in pregnancy, even small doses of alcohol increase the risk for premature birth and other complications.

Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nThe number of cancer cases in the U.S. is expected to rise by about 45 percent as the nation\u2019s population ages, making it the leading cause of death in the United States by 2030, according to a report released Tuesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology The report, The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014, calls on policymakers to make financial commitments to cancer research and care and calls on healthcare workers to be \u201cmore nimble and creative\u201d in bringing advances to patients.It says that oncology is in a time of \u201cextraordinary change and opportunity\u201d because of technological advances, healthcare policy changes, and demographic shifts.Among the issues of concern are expected increases in the number of cancer survivors, presently at 13.7 million, along with rising healthcare costs and potential work force shortages.The number of new cancer cases is expected to rise from 1.6 million to 2.3 million annually by 2030, while the number of survivors is expected to reach 18 million by 2022.Squeezed by tight margins, small oncology practices are merging, selling, and closing, requiring patients to pay more and travel farther for care, CNN reported. Demand for oncology services is expected to rise by 42 percent by 2030, while the number of oncologists is expected to rise by 28 percent.The ASCO is pushing for changes to the payment system that determines physicians\u2019 reimbursement rates.\"What you are seeing from Medicare as well as others is they continue to constrain the revenues to practices. At the same time, the number of patients everyone is seeing is going up as the population increases,\" said Blase Polite, an oncologist at the University of Chicago, according to Reuters . \"Combine that with the cost of the care that we're providing ... It's really creating a very difficult financial situation.\"", "703": "The USA faces a serious threat to its cancer care system as growing demand for care outstrips the supply of oncologists.\n\n\n\nThat is the key point of a landmark report released by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) which notes that advances in treatment, screening and prevention have produced a dramatic decline in deaths in recent decades, with a record 13.7 million cancer survivors living in the USA. However, due largely to the aging of the population as well as lifestyle changes, the number of new cancer cases in the USA is projected to increase by as much as 42% by 2025.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the cost is projected to reach $175 billion by 2020, an increase of 40% from 2010. Despite a near doubling of demand for cancer care services, the number of oncologists will likely grow by only 28%, leaving a projected deficit of 1,487 physicians in just over a decade.\n\n\n\nASCO says that given an oncologist sees an average of 300 new patients each year, \"nearly 450,000 new patients are likely to face obstacles in getting life-saving care\". The report reveals that the problem will be especially felt in rural areas where only 3% of oncologists practice but where nearly one in five Americans lives. More than 70% of US counties analysed by ASCO have no medical oncologists at all.\n\n\n\nASCO president Clifford Hudis said that \"we're facing a collection of challenges, each one of which could keep cancer treatment advances out of reach for some individuals\". He added that \"when patients first hear the word 'cancer,' one of the last things they should have to worry about is finding a qualified doctor\".\n\n\n\nDr Hudis went on to say that \"we need to plan and invest to avoid that, pursuing everything from leveraging technology and innovative practice models to using non-physician providers as part of teams providing patient care\". He concludes by saying that \"the US cancer system is among the best in the world, but it simply cannot continue to meet the growing needs of patients with cancer unless fundamental, systemic change is pursued\".", "704": "At a time when we are more and more likely to catch cancers at a stage when they are treatable thanks to improved early detection, the American Society of Clinical Oncology reports the United States is facing a severe shortage of cancer specialists over the coming years, 1200 WOAI news reports.\n\nThat means that patients will have to wait longer to see a cancer specialist, at a time when early, aggressive treatment is being seen as the best way to stop cancers from doing damage.\n\nAnd Dr. Anthony Tolcher, who is the Clinical Director at San Antonio's START Center for Cancer Care, and one of the country's most respected oncologists, says changes in Medicare reimbursements for physicians under Obamacare is making the situation worse.\n\n\"Most patients who develop cancer are actually in the Medicare range, 65 and older, and we also have a new insurance system that is going to pay lower than most commercial insurance rates,\" Dr. Tolcher said.\n\nThe result, Dr. Tolcher says, is that new doctors may pick more profitable specialties.\n\nThe ASCO report says the United States will be short 1500 oncologists in the coming decade. The report says that will be especially troublesome for patients in rural areas and in inner cities, which are already underserved.\n\nDr. Tolcher said all we had to do is look to Canada, which instituted a government run health care system several decades ago.\n\n\"And ultimately, people there are faced with long waits, longer times to see a specialist, and, ultimately, I think, inferior care.\"\n\nThe report concludes that the drop in oncologists comes at the worst possible time. The huge Baby boomer generation is moving into their sixties, at a time when they are at the largest risk for cancer.\n\nThe ASCO says there are now a record 13.7 million cancer survivors in the United States, and many of them will want to maintain a relationship with their oncologist, something that will be difficult to do with fewer cancer specialists available.\n\nAnd Obamacare will bring millions of new people into the system who previously did not have insurance, and they will be seeking out cancer treatment as well.\n\nThe total cost of cancer treatment is expected to reach $175 billion a year by 2020, up 40% from today's figures.", "705": "Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, and also one of the leading causes of death worldwide. One in every fourth deaths in the U.S. is a result of heart disease, but medical experts believe that will soon change.\n\nSixteen years from now in 2030, the American Society of Clinical Oncology reports that cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States. Although cancer research has been extensive in recent decades, there are still physician shortages and financial difficulties that the medical field is dealing with.\n\nOngoing research can only do so much, and the prediction of a 45% increase in cancer diagnoses by 2030 is not going to help. There are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs, but some people are resistant to them and some people could be further affected negatively by them. However, cancer patients are living as long as they ever have.\n\nObamacare is also expected to have a negative effect on this state of affairs as many more Americans will have health insurance and be eligible for care by 2030. There is already a shortage of oncologists in the United States and that is not expected to improve in the coming years. Additionally, the average cost of cancer drugs is $10,000 per month, which many people already don't have, and many certainly will not have by 2030.\n\nCancer is already creeping up on heart disease. In 2013, the American Cancer Society projected that there would be over 1.6 million new cancer diagnoses and about 580,000 cancer-related deaths. Perhaps the increase in projections for cancer diagnoses could be related to the growing prevalence of obesity, which raises one's risk of cancer.\n\nDoctors, health experts, and scientists will be working hard in the coming years to help cope with these imminent problems. School cafeterias have already been placing restrictions on junk food and former mayor Mike Bloomberg of New York City banned large-sized cups to control sugary drink consumption. If society can improve their health in various respects, the United States could help refute these projects by 2030.\n\nTo read more about this issue, visit the American Cancer Society website as well as this CNN article.", "706": "The nation's ability to provide quality cancer care heads toward a conflicted future of increasing demand, rising costs, and a contracting, if not dwindling workforce.\n\nThe vision of competing interests emerged from a review by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which aired the challenges in a webcast that brought together representatives of some of the key stakeholders.\n\nThe cancer patient population (and demand for oncology services) is expected to increase by 43% by 2025, whereas the number of practicing oncologists will increase by 28%, a difference that would represent a shortfall of almost 1,500 practitioners.\n\nCurrently, oncologists see an average of 300 new patients a year. That means 450,000 new cancer patients could face major obstacles in access to quality cancer care, ASCO president Clifford Hudis, MD, said during the webcast.\n\nAdditional pressure comes from the changing demographics of the U.S. population, not only in terms of patients, but the oncology field. Almost 20% of practicing oncologists are 65 or older, and since 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 has exceeded the proportion younger than 40.\n\nThe squeeze created by demand that outstrips workforce growth will have the greatest impact on cancer patients in rural areas. About 20% of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, whereas 3% of oncologists practice in areas that would be characterized as rural.\n\n\"There's a big difference between a 5- or 10-minute car ride across a small town versus a 2-hour drive one way to the big city,\" Hudis, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said during the webcast.\n\nThe ASCO review showed that 70% of U.S. counties analyzed did not have even one oncologist.\n\nThe squeeze extends beyond the rural oncology setting and into community practices, he continued. A third of all new cancer patients receive care from community-based oncologists. Yet, almost two-thirds of community oncology practices are likely to merge, sell, or close within the next year.\n\nCarolyn Hendricks, MD, an oncologist in solo practice in Bethesda, Md., offers an example of the hard choices that community oncologists have to make. Reimbursement for office-based administration of oncology drugs has decreased, but the cost of purchasing the drugs has increased dramatically with the introduction of novel therapies.\n\nAdditionally, community oncology practices must maintain the same quality standards (including trained personnel) as those applied to hospital outpatient clinics, which receive higher payments for drug administration.\n\n\"Over the past 2 years, my practice has lost a significant amount of revenue,\" Hendricks said during the webcast. \"Community oncologists purchase drugs on credit, essentially a giant credit card, and then we scramble to get reimbursed.\n\n\"As a result, I now have a significant amount of debt, and I have had a significant reduction in my own income. My income now approximates what I made 10 years ago. Of course, I retain my staff's salaries because I love my staff and want to keep them.\"\n\nHendricks is now weighing her options, following the breakdown of talks to sell her practice to a hospital, which backed out because of uncertainty about the economics of community-based oncology practice. Merger and closure are the only remaining options, both of which would adversely affect her patients, she added.\n\nA final pressure on oncology care comes from the rising cost. The ASCO review suggests that the nation's annual cost for oncology care will reach almost $175 billion by 2020. By comparison, the total cost of oncology care was $104 billion in 2006.\n\nAdding to the financial strain has been a National Cancer Institute budget that has lost 23% of its effective purchasing power since 2003, said Hudis.\n\nThe actions of the federal government figure prominently in the future of oncology care. The congressionally mandated budget cuts that went into effect in 2013, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the contentious sustainable growth rate offer just a few examples of far-reaching effects of governmental actions related to oncology care.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee health subcommittee, acknowledged that partisan politics often has interfered with meaningful action to resolve the obstacles to access to quality cancer care. He also acknowledged that cancer care is not necessarily the top priority for many members of the House or Senate.\n\nUsing a baseball analogy, Blumenauer emphasized the need for small advances before taking a big step toward improving cancer care.\n\n\"Even if it's not a grand-slam home run, I'm of the philosophy that you can't have a grand-slam home run unless you have someone on base,\" he said. \"So let's hit a single or a double. Let's move forward with something that can make a profound difference in how we deliver healthcare.\"\n\n\"We've made healthcare far too contentious, partisan, ideological, and shouting-head media something,\" he added. \"It doesn't have to be that way, shouldn't be that way. So much of what will make a profound difference in our ability to deliver the quality healthcare we want, at a price that's affordable, in a way that's accessible, actually isn't that hard. It doesn't have to be red state-blue state, Republican-Democrat.\"\n\nThe ASCO report \"The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014\" is available on the organization's website.\n\n2014-03-11T18:59:14-0400", "707": "Clifford A. Hudis, MD\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nThe US cancer care system is faced with increasing cuts to Medicare payments, the prospect of a dramatic increase in the number of patients with cancer, and proportionately fewer oncology specialists to treat them, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) warned Tuesday.In a webcast led by ASCO President Clifford A. Hudis, MD, the group is calling for Congress to help stabilize payments to doctors under Medicare by repealing the much-maligned sustainable growth rate (SGR), even as a March 31 deadline for action approaches. The webcast also highlighted a landmark report released by ASCO, The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014.ASCO and other physician groups have been pressing Congress for years to alter the SGR. The US House of Representatives plans to vote on a replacement formula for reimbursing physicians for Medicare services later this week.As a result of payment cuts and lowered reimbursement for chemotherapy agents, ASCO says smaller practices, which consist of 1 to 2 physicians, are becoming increasingly rare. As the primary source of cancer care in small towns and rural communities in the South and West, this trend will make access to local high-quality, personalized treatment burdensome to patients.Carolyn B. Hendricks, MD, a solo practice medical oncologist in suburban Maryland said that for the first time she couldn\u2019t afford to treat her patients in her office but had to send them to the hospital to receive their infusion therapy. \u201cMy patients were very surprised to see the out-of-pocket costs associated with receiving treatment in a hospital,\u201d she said during the webcast.Her practice faces a daunting future because of the increased cost of chemotherapy drugs and the lowered reimbursement paid by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a practice sometimes referred to as \u201cbuy-and-bill.\u201d\u201cGiving chemotherapy is expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cMy practice has lost revenue and has to purchase chemotherapy on credit and then scramble to be reimbursed adequately.\u201dYears ago, the buy-and-bill model was lucrative. That\u2019s quickly changing as higher priced drugs and lower reimbursement affect the viability of small practices, leaving them with four possibilities: purchasing another practice, selling the current practice, merging with a larger practice or hospital, or closing the practice entirely.If more small practices close, it will have an effect on workforce shortages, says the report. ASCO estimates that by 2025, the demand for oncology services will grow by 42% or more, while the supply of oncologists will grow by only 28%. That translates to a shortage of more than 1480 oncologists by 2025.Like most clinical care workforces, medical oncologists are growing older as a group. In 2008, the proportion of oncologists aged 64 years and older surpassed the proportion under 40 years of age, according to the report. That age gap is expected to grow wider, the report said, since medical oncologists tend to be slightly older than the general physician population.Such pressures on the oncology workforce could not come at worse time, however. Although advances in treatment and screening have produced a decline in cancer deaths in recent decadeswith 13.7 million survivors in the United Statesthe number of newly diagnosed cases of cancer is projected to increase by as much as 42% by 2025.Responding to these challenges, ASCO is recommending the development and testing of new care delivery models and payment models, ending persistent financial threats, and repeal of the SGR. The group also recommends greater use of physician-led quality initiatives such as ASCO\u2019s Quality Oncology Practice Initiatives (QOPI) and the CancerLinQ learning system that is currently under development and will provide oncologists, regardless of geographic location, personalized guidance and real-time quality feedback to improve patient care.\u201cThe US cancer system is among the best in the world, but it cannot continue to meet the growing needs of patients unless fundamental, systematic change is pursued,\u201d Hudis said. \u201cWe encourage Congress to seize this opportunity, and act now.\u201d", "708": "The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released a new report on Tuesday that describes a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of future challenges, which could easily undermine access to the many life-saving advances in cancer care. Among these impending challenges are soaring costs, a physician shortage, a fast growing population of survivors, and threats to smaller practices. \u201cWe think we owe it to the 1.6 million Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer this year to address these problems,\u201d said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, ASCO president, in a live webcast.\n\nCancer Care 2014... and Beyond\n\n\"The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014\" is a first-ever comprehensive report on the difficulties facing the U.S. cancer care delivery system. Nearly 35,000 oncologists and other professionals are represented by ASCO and their many opinions inform the new report. Months in the making, the report examines both current and projected demand for services and compares this to oncologist workforce supply while also including scrutiny of the full range of economic, regulatory, and administrative pressures that oncology practices face.\n\nKey findings include a swift growth in demand for prevention, screening, and treatment services. By 2030, the number of new cancer cases will increase by 45 percent. \u201cAt the same time, the number of cancer survivors, now at 13.7 million, will continue to grow,\u201d the report states. Because survivors require ongoing care, the demand for oncology, other cancer treatment services, as well as end-of-life care will naturally increase. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to think that any other issue that will have a bigger impact on American families than this,\u201d Representative Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) noted in the webcast. He added, \u201cThis condition extends onto family and friends and if we don\u2019t do it right, the impact on the caregiver, the impact on the family \u2026 can be extraordinarily stressful.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the report speaks to uneven access to cancer care across the nation. \u201cRates of access to care are disproportionately lower for African Americans and Latinos,\u201d is stated in the report. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may provide millions more with health insurance coverage and though this helps, ASCO believes it will not solve disparities in cancer care due to the fact that it emphasizes expanding Medicaid coverage. (In the past, Medicaid has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cancer.) Other difficulties with regard to access to care may soon arise due to a doctor shortage.\n\nDisconnect between Patients and Doctors\n\n\u201cAs of 2012, there were 13,400 oncologists practicing in the U.S.,\u201d said Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, who runs a private oncologist practice in Bethesda, Md. However, Hendricks noted, there are more oncologists who are over 64 and approaching retirement than oncologists under 40 and so the data predicts a shortage of physicians: by ASCO estimates, a deficit of almost 1,500 doctors in the coming years. Add to that a natural and uneven distribution. According to Hendricks, one in five Americans live in areas designated as rural, while only one in 33 oncologists practice in rural areas. This \u201cdisconnect\u201d between patients and doctors will matter more in the coming years, especially as smaller oncology practices (under seven oncologists) are becoming more rare. Though they serve more than a third of new patients, nearly two-thirds of small community practices may merge, sell, or close in just the next year alone. With chemo costs based on quantity, Hendricks explained, \u201cWe [smaller practices] pay more for the same drugs as bigger practices.\u201d\n\nAnd though costs are increasing throughout the healthcare system, this trend is most pronounced within cancer care, where annual costs are projected to rise to more than $173 billion in 2020 \u2014 a whopping 40 percent increase between the years 2010 and 2020. \u201cAccess to high-quality cancer care will be sustained and expanded only if we address these rising costs, including the use of unnecessary or ineffective tests and treatments,\u201d noted the report.\n\nDespite the glum news, ASCO has developed several initiatives to ease the way into the future. Dr. Blase Polite, University of Chicago Medicine, discussed measures to help waylay costs while addressing distribution of doctors and focused particularly on the expansion of health IT. The Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) and Cancer LINQ help oncologists access standards of care and data no matter where their practice is located. As Polite explained, currently, oncologists \u201ccollect information from patients on a daily basis but it sits in our own silos.\u201d The Cancer LINQ, an advance IT system, brings all the data together so when a doctor in a rural practice confronts some rarely seen cancer, he or she will be able to get information from practices across the country.\n\nOther recommendations by ASCO include support for SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act 2014, which modifies payment structures, and the establishment of national standards to measure value in oncology care. Consistent, high-quality cancer care will only be achieved if Medicare and private insurers work with physicians to introduce new payment models. \u201cWe want to develop the solutions,\u201d Hudis said, referring directly to ASCO's report. \u201cWe want to be solving the problem of delivering quality care across the country to the people who need it.\u201d\n\nSource: The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014.

They couldn't compete with hospitals in the area for radiation therapy and other services that would have diversified their practice, and insurers had the upper hand in contract negotiations.\n\nIt became obvious, as Ward said, \"that 0% of zero would be zero.\" So Ward and his colleagues decided to leave the community oncology network and join a large hospital system in Seattle.\n\nWard's story illustrates a growing problem for cancer care in the United States, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology's inaugural report, \"The State of Cancer Care in America,\" which was released Tuesday.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge, sell or close in the upcoming year. And as community practices disappear, patients are paying more and traveling farther for quality care, an issue compounded by physician shortages and a rapidly aging population.\n\n\"If you can't get care, you can't get good care,\" said American Society of Clinical Oncology President Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief of Breast Cancer Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nIn 16 years, cancer is expected to become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease, according to the society's report. The number of new cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030, from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually.\n\nThe number of cancer survivors will also increase dramatically.

Today, there are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans now live at least five years after a cancer diagnosis, up from about half in the 1970s, the report authors write. Survivors need ongoing care, as they're at higher risk for other types of cancer and conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will also increase the need for oncologists, as millions of Americans get newly covered by health insurance.\n\nTaking these future patients into consideration, the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42% by 2030. Yet the number of oncologists is expected to grow only 28%, leading to a shortage of more than 1,400 physicians.\n\nA large part of this is because of the aging physician population, according to the report. In 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 surpassed the proportion younger than 40 for the first time. A large number of communities in central and Midwestern states are covered solely by these older doctors. When they retire, more patients will have to travel farther to find care.\n\n\"The shortage of oncologists is a real problem,\" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"Many smaller practices actually provide a lot of uncompensated care to those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not pay well.\"\n\nThe report also highlights the need to lower costs, for both doctors and patients. Right now, the system is designed to compensate doctors for how much they do, rather than how well they do it. That goes against the oncology society's recommendations, which encourage physicians to avoid performing unnecessary tests and treatments.\n\n\"One of the reasons that so many patients are harmed in medicine is they are over-treated,\" Brawley said.\n\nDrug prices are another big concern. When Ward started practicing, the average cancer drug cost $1,000 per month. Today, he said, the average is $10,000 per month.\n\n\"If we don't begin to control these prices in one way or another, in 20 more years, the average cost of a cancer drug will be $100,000. That's not sustainable,\" he said. \"Twenty percent copay on $10,000 (per month) is not in the pocketbook for most of my patients.\"\n\nBrawley said price is one of the biggest reasons there is such a disparity in cancer outcomes; research shows minorities are more likely to develop cancer and more likely to die from cancer.\n\nTo combat some of the issues raised in the report and improve patient care, the society is working on several projects involving \"big data.\" These projects will help physicians \"distill massive volumes of data into meaningful information,\" according to the report authors.\n\nShoppers have Amazon.

Its goal, Hudis said, is to prevent mistakes before they happen.\n\n\"I'd rather have a doctor who avoids mistakes than one who learns from them,\" he said.\n\nThe oncology society said it expects to roll out some components of the system in early 2015.\n\nPosted by Greg Palmer", "710": "\u00d7 Report: Cancer will be No. 1 killer in U.S. in 16 years\n\n(CNN) \u2014 In 16 years, cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease, according to a new report from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

According to American Cancer Society, excess body weight might increase cancer risk via several mechanisms such as hormone regulation, immune system or inflammation.\n\nThe latest study report was based on 25 population-based studies. Researchers looked at data on diet, weight and levels of physical activity, Healthday reported. They found that excess weight is linked with an increase in ovarian cancer risk. The risk is especially high for women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or above. BMI is an indirect way of determining fat levels in the body.\n\n\"We know that obesity affects hormones known to affect the cancer process,\" Bandera told HealthDay. \"It also leads to insulin resistance and [high levels of insulin], as well as a chronic systemic inflammation. Inflammation, in particular, has been a major factor implicated in ovarian cancer development and is also associated with poorer survival.\"\n\nPrevious study by National Institute on Aging researchers, also found a link between fat and cancer risk.

Fat tissue is not only the main energy store in our bodies, but it is also metabolically active, producing hormone like compounds that promote inflammation and specific proteins that can affect cell growth and turnover, thus increasing the risk of some forms of cancer, Uauy explained.\n\n\"This finding is significant for two reasons. Firstly, ovarian cancer is both difficult to detect and often deadly, with the chances of the cancer recurring quite high. Secondly, maintaining a healthy body weight offers women a way to reduce the risk of getting the disease,\" Uauy said on his blog at World Cancer Research Fund International.\n\n\"This should not be interpreted to mean that excess weight is the single most important risk factor for ovarian cancer.

I didn\u2019t have much of an appetite,\u201d Marcia Peters said.\n\nDr. Sharyn Lewin, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, explained that the disease is typically detected in its later stages.\n\n\u201cWe do not have an effective screening mechanism for detecting ovarian cancer at early stages so we usually, unfortunately, detect women when they are stage 3 or 4. Very advanced stages,\u201d Dr. Lewin said.\n\nA massive review has confirmed that too much weight can be a risk factor ovarian cancer.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund looked at twenty-five previous studies involving 4-million women and found that for every five additional BMI units women had a 6 percent increase of developing ovarian cancer.\n\nFive extra BMI units translates to an average of about 30 lbs of weight.\n\n\u201cI think what is new with this study is just the magnitude, the increased risk that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Dr. Lewin said, \u201cHow obesity plays a role in ovarian cancer development and the magnitude of that effect is what is new with this particular article.\u201d\n\nThe reason that increased weight is risky is that fat tissue actually makes hormones, in this case estrogen, which is known to increase the risk ovarian cancer.\n\nThe good news is that weight is one of the few risk factors women can actually modify.\n\n\u201cIdentifying a healthy body weight and ways to modify that with exercise, appropriate diets, that is one risk factor that patients can really do something about,\u201d Dr. Lewin said.\n\nThe 6 percent increase in risk per 30 lbs is bad enough but when combined with other risk factors it becomes even more significant.\n\nDr. Lewin said that women with a family history of ovarian cancer should be tested for BRCA mutations.

Most ovarian cancers are either ovarian epithelial carcinomas (cancer that begins in the cells on the surface of the ovary) or malignant germ cell tumors (cancer that begins in egg cells). During the past several decades, the percentage of overweight and obese adults and children has increased markedly.\n\nObesity is associated with increased risks of cancers of the esophagus, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium (the lining of the uterus), colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, gallbladder, and possibly other cancer types.\n\nObese people are also at higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a number of other chronic diseases. 1. What is obesity? Obesity is a condition in which a person has an abnormally high and unhealthy proportion of body fat. To measure obesity, researchers commonly use a scale known as the body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person\u2019s weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared. BMI provides a more accurate measure of obesity or being overweight than weight alone. Guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) place adults age 20 and older into the following categories based on their BMI: BMI BMI Categories Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 to 24.9 Normal 25.0 to 29.9 Overweight 30.0 and above Obese The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute provides a BMI calculator. For children and adolescents (less than 20 years of age), overweight and obesity are based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) BMI-for-age growth charts: BMI BMI Categories BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 85th percentile, but less than 95th percentile Overweight BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 95th percentile Obese Compared with people of normal weight, those who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for many diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and certain cancers. 2. How common is overweight or obesity? Results from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that 68 percent of U.S. adults age 20 years and older are overweight or obese. In 1988-1994, by contrast, only 56 percent of adults age 20 and older were overweight or obese. In addition, the percentage of children who are overweight or obese has also increased. Among children and teens ages 2 to 19, 17 percent are estimated to be obese, based on the 2007\u20132008 survey. In 1988\u20131994, that figure was only 10 percent. 3. What is known about the relationship between obesity and cancer? Obesity is associated with increased risks of the following cancer types, and possibly others as well: Esophagus\n\nPancreas\n\nColon and rectum\n\nBreast (after menopause)\n\nEndometrium (lining of the uterus)\n\nKidney\n\nThyroid\n\nGallbladder One study, using NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, estimated that in 2007 in the United States, about 34,000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50,500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity. The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers, particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma. A projection of the future health and economic burden of obesity in 2030 estimated that continuation of existing trends in obesity will lead to about 500,000 additional cases of cancer in the United States by 2030. This analysis also found that if every adult reduced their BMI by 1 percent, which would be equivalent to a weight loss of roughly 1 kg (or 2.2 lbs) for an adult of average weight, this would prevent the increase in the number of cancer cases and actually result in the avoidance of about 100,000 new cases of cancer. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association of obesity with increased risk of certain cancers: Fat tissue produces excess amounts of estrogen, high levels of which have been associated with the risk of breast, endometrial, and some other cancers.\n\nObese people often have increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1) in their blood (a condition known as hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance), which may promote the development of certain tumors.\n\nFat cells produce hormones, called adipokines, that may stimulate or inhibit cell growth. For example, leptin, which is more abundant in obese people, seems to promote cell proliferation, whereas adiponectin, which is less abundant in obese people, may have antiproliferative effects.\n\nFat cells may also have direct and indirect effects on other tumor growth regulators, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase\n\nObese people often have chronic low-level, or \u201csubacute,\u201d inflammation, which has been associated with increased cancer risk. Other possible mechanisms include altered immune responses, effects on the nuclear factor kappa beta system, and oxidative stress.

But new research suggests that women who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop the disease, compared with women of a healthy weight.\n\nInvestigators from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research conducted the study as part of the WCRF's Continuous Update Project.\n\nThe project monitors and assesses research associated with cancer prevention and uses this information to come to conclusions about how lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, may reduce cancer risk.\n\nFor other cancers, including breast, bowel and womb cancer, past research has found that being overweight or obese is a risk factor. Now, ovarian cancer can be added to the list, meaning women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of developing the disease.\n\nTo reach their findings, the research team reviewed 25 studies involving 4 million women. Of these, 16,000 had ovarian cancer.\n\nThe researchers found that for every 5 additional body mass index (BMI) units, there was a 6% increase in the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a non-linear analysis revealed that women with a BMI greater than 28.4 kg/m2 had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer than women with a lower BMI.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Dr. Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at WCRF, says:\n\n\"Previously we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.\"\n\nThe importance of body weight in cancer risk\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is deemed a normal weight for adults aged 20 years or older, while 25-29.9 is classed as overweight and 30 or above is deemed as obese.\n\nFast facts about ovarian cancer There are expected to be around 21,980 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the US this year\n\nIt is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths among women\n\nAround 50% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are aged 63 years or older.\n\nApproximately 64% of women in the US are considered to be overweight or obese. These women are at increased risk of 1 in 8 cancers, including breast, bowel, womb, colorectal and now, ovarian cancer.\n\n\"These latest findings from the Continuous Update Project show how important body weight is for an increasing number of cancers affecting both men and women,\" says Dr. Kate Allen, executive director of science and public affairs at WCRF.\n\nIn order to maintain a healthy weight, the WCRF says it is important to have BMI checked regularly.\n\nChoosing foods that are lower in energy density, avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, and opting for smaller portion sizes for meals will also help maintain a healthy weight.\n\nBeing physically active is also important for a healthy weight, and both diet and exercise has been directly linked to reduced cancer risk.\n\nMedical News Today recently reported on a study finding that postmenopausal women who followed a healthy lifestyle had a 22% lower risk of breast cancer and a 52% lower risk of colorectal cancer.", "723": "Review adds the disease to long list of tumors linked to obesity.

Bandera said the average woman's lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.4 percent.\n\nBody-mass index (BMI) is a rough estimate of a person's body fat based on weight and height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal. Between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, and 30 and over is considered obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlmost 600,000 people develop one of the eight cancers linked to overweight and obesity in the United States each year, according to the report compiled by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Foundation. If everyone were at a healthy weight, about one in five of those cancers\u2014or 120,000 cases of cancer a year\u2014could be prevented, according to the report.\n\n\"We know that obesity affects hormones known to affect the cancer process,\" Bandera said. \"It also leads to insulin resistance and [high levels of insulin], as well as a chronic systemic inflammation. Inflammation, in particular, has been a major factor implicated in ovarian cancer development and is also associated with poorer survival.\"\n\nRegistered dietician Samantha Heller said she wasn't surprised by the report's findings.\n\n\"Research suggests that up to 90 percent to 95 percent of cancers may be preventable with diet and lifestyle,\" said Heller, the clinical nutrition coordinator at the Center for Cancer Care at Griffin Hospital, in Derby, Conn. \"Of those, as many as 30 percent to 35 percent are linked to diet.\"\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief, fat cells are not the inert compounds we once thought,\" Heller said. \"They are biologically very active cells that produce both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory compounds, as well as hormones and other chemicals.\"\n\n\"An excess of fat cells\u2014if someone is overweight or obese\u2014appears to knock off the body's delicate balance of health,\" Heller said. \"This can lead to inflammation and hormonal imbalances, and can promote the growth of cancer cells.\"\n\nThe current report is part of an ongoing project. The last report was published in 2007, Bandera said.\n\nOverall, the report included 25 population-based studies examining how diet, weight and physical activity might affect the risk of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. A major reason for that is that ovarian cancer often isn't diagnosed until it's in the later stages.\n\nBandera and her colleagues concluded that body fat is likely a contributing factor to the development of ovarian cancer. The risk is greatest for those with a BMI over 30, she added.\n\nAlthough the study found an association between body fat and ovarian cancer risk, it did not establish a cause-and-effect link.\n\nThe report also found that height is a factor in the development of ovarian cancer, with taller women at higher risk. The reason height is linked to ovarian cancer is unclear, Bandera said, although genetic factors and early growth rates might play a role.\n\n\"What this means for cancer prevention is that prevention efforts need to target the life course, not just adulthood, and families, not just individuals,\" Bandera said.\n\nThe researchers said they were unable to conclude if any dietary factors might be protective because there simply weren't enough studies to draw any conclusions.\n\nFor now, both experts said maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent some cancers.\n\n\"Because we also have evidence linking obesity to other cancers and other chronic diseases, maintenance of healthy weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise is a safe bet to live a healthy life,\" Bandera said.\n\nExplore further: Nearly 60 percent of uterine cancer cases preventable, report says\n\nMore information: Learn more about ovarian cancer from the American Cancer Society.\n\n", "724": "Close\n\nWomen tending towards the higher end of the Body Mass Index (BMI) bear an increased risk of developing ovarian tumors, a recent study has found.\n\nObesity has previously been tied to a higher incidence of other cancers, including breast, kidney, gallbladder and pancreatic (among others), though a new report from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) has unearthed a previously undetermined link between surplus weight and ovarian cancer. Indeed, the study tracked a marked increase per every five-point leap in BMI, with each interval upping the risk by six percent.\n\nA definite causal relationship between obesity and ovarian cancer remains unconfirmed, despite numbers gleaned from the 25 population-based studies indicating a clear increase in the likelihood of developing tumors. \"We can now say with certainty that being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and womb cancer,\" said Dr. Rachel Thompson, the WCRF's head of research and interpretation.\n\nThe same report found that approximately 600,000 Americans develop cancers caused by excess weight annually, and has estimated that around 120,000 of those cases could be avoided if everybody was at their optimal weight. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a healthy weight sitting between 18.5 and 24.9 on the BMI, while anything between 25 and 30 is deemed overweight. Obesity is determined if the BMI falls at 30 or over.\n\nThe findings are instrumental in the prevention of ovarian tumors, with previous causes relegated to immutable factors such as family history of the disease (including presence of the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes) and even age. Now, with lifestyle noted as a likely culprit, at-risk women can take steps to improve their diet and exercise in a bid to ward off the disease. \"This means that women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer. Previously, we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer,\" said Thompson.\n\n\u24d2 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

About 585,600 cases of these cancers are diagnosed every year.\n\nNew research suggests that if everyone was at a healthy weight it would prevent 120,900, or one in five of these cancer cases, the news release reported.\n\n\"This is an important finding because it shows a way for women to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer,\" Elisa V. Bandera, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and one of the expert panelists who authored the new AICR/WCRF Continuous Update Project (CUP) report, said in the news release. \"There is so much we don't know about preventing ovarian cancer, but now we can tell women that keeping to a healthy weight can help protect against this deadly disease.\"\n\nTo make their findings the researchers looked at four million women; 16,000 of them were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The team identified a six percent increase in ovarian cancer risk for every five point increase in BMI.\n\n\"These latest findings from the Continuous Update Project offer another reminder that our weight, and our lifestyle, play an important role in cancer risk for both women and men,\" AICR Associate Director of Nutrition Programs, Alice Bender, MS, RDN, said in the news releae. \"This is really an empowering message. There are no guarantees, but adding activity into your day and healthy plant foods onto your plate are steps you can take today to reduce your risk of cancer and other chronic conditions as well.\"", "726": "\"Greater body fatness is a probable cause of ovarian cancer in women,\" according to a new report by the American Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nFor its report, the AICR looked at 25 studies that involved data on 4 million women, 16,000 of whom had ovarian cancer, and found a link between body fat and ovarian cancer\u2014a link that the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute has long suspected.\n\nThere are many reasons why fat may raise cancer risk. Fat cells secrete estrogen, a hormone that can help fuel cancer, and people who are overweight or obese have overall higher levels of inflammation, which can affect heart disease and cancer risk alike. Fat cells produce other hormones, such as leptin and growth factors, that may affect the out-of-control cell growth that underlies cancer.\n\nOut of all the possible causes of ovarian cancer that the AICR investigated\u2014milk, eggs, coffee, meat, to name a few\u2014body fat was the only one to provide evidence showing a possible cause.\n\n\"There is so much we don't know about preventing ovarian cancer,\" said Dr. Elisa Bandera of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, who helped write the study, \"But now we can tell women that keeping to a healthy weight can help protect against this deadly disease.\"", "727": "Obesity is known to increase the risk for certain cancers, such as breast and bowel. Now, a study concludes that it may also raise the chances of developing ovarian cancer.\n\nResearchers from the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research reviewed 25 studies of four million women. Sixteen thousand had ovarian cancer. A correlation between obesity and ovarian cancer was noted when it became clear that for every five additional body index mass (BMI) units, the risk of ovarian cancer rose by 6 percent. Additionally, a non-linear analysis found that women with a BMI higher than 28.4 significantly increased their risk of ovarian cancer compared to women with a lower BMI.\n\nThis is considered a major finding to help in the fight to prevent ovarian cancer. As one researcher noted, only fixed risk factors such as age and family history were previously known, but now working to maintain a healthy weight may be a factor in preventing the development of ovarian cancer.\n\nNEXT: Research supports \"five-second rule\" on dropped food\n\nSourced from: medicalnewstoday.com, Being overweight or obese 'a risk factor' for ovarian cancer", "728": "Putting on weight can increase women's risk of ovarian cancer, according to a new assessment of the evidence.\n\nOvarian cancer has a poor prognosis because it has few symptoms and is usually caught at a late stage. More than 7,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year and there are about 4,300 deaths. If it is caught early more than 90% of women will survive for at least five years, but at the late stage that drops to less than 10%.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which works on the prevention of cancer, has published an update of the risks for ovarian cancer, as part of its Continuous Update Project. For the first time, it says that overweight and obesity are a probable cause.\n\nWeight is known to be an issue in some other cancers, including breast and bowel cancer. In the UK 61% of people (57% of women) are overweight or obese which, says the WCRF, puts them at greater risk of developing one of eight types of cancer than their normal-weight neighbours.\n\nThe WRCF says an estimated 23,400 cases of cancer \u2013 one in six \u2013 could be avoided if nobody was overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of its 10 recommendations for avoiding cancer.\n\n\"We can now say with certainty that being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and womb cancer,\" said Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation. \"This means that women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer.\n\n\"Previously we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.\"\n\nThe increased risk is fairly small. The researchers analysed the results of 25 studies involving 4 million women, 16,000 of whom developed ovarian cancer. They found a 6% increased risk for every five extra BMI units (BMI \u2013 body mass index \u2013 is a calculation based on weight relative to height, and normal BMI levels are 18.5 to 25).\n\nHow significant a 6% increase for every extra BMI point is will depend on a woman's risk to begin with; it matters far more to someone who has a family history of it, for instance. But being overweight is one of the few ovarian cancer risk factors that women can do something about.\n\nAdult height is also a risk, the WCRF says, because it is a result of the rate of growth in the womb and in childhood, which is also a factor in obesity.\n\nThe charity Target Ovarian Cancer pointed out that the additional risk was not massive, but it highlighted the benefits of healthier lifestyles.\n\n\"This new study supports earlier work that a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of ovarian cancer,\" said Dr Simon Newman, head of research. \"For someone without a family history of ovarian cancer, their lifetime risk of developing the disease is 2%. The findings of this latest study suggest this increases to 2.24% for an obese person, which is still a low risk.\"\n\nGilda Witte, chief executive of the charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said the research finally provided clarity on the link between obesity and ovarian cancer.\n\n\"This robust report enables us to give clear guidance to women, and importantly for parents who can begin to encourage their daughters to adopt a healthy lifestyle as soon as possible so that the next generation has the best chance of reducing their risk,\" she said.", "729": "One smoker is quitting every two hours in the Lothians after a record rush to quit the habit.\n\nToday, the Evening News launches our Smoke Free Lothian campaign to help cut the annual 1800 death toll still further.\n\nRecord numbers of people are stopping smoking with one person quitting every two hours across the Lothians.\n\nThe rising cost of the habit, much better support services and the impact of the smoking ban and other changes in the law are said to be behind the big rise.\n\nBut smoking still kills 1800 people in the Lothians each year and costs NHS Lothian \u00a376.7 million to treat patients who indulge.\n\nThat is why the Evening News is helping launch the Smoke Free Lothian campaign today \u2013 national No Smoking Day \u2013 alongside NHS Lothian and Community Pharmacy Scotland.\n\nNearly a quarter of people still smoke in the region but we hope to drive that down towards zero. Driving smoking levels down by just one per cent in the Lothians would save 81 lives a year.\n\nDr Dermot Gorman, public health consultant for NHS Lothian, said giving up is never easy, but he was confident many will rise to the challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big ask because nicotine is highly addictive but we do have increasingly successful services that we\u2019re very proud of, they are making a difference,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of reasons why people have decided to stop smoking \u2013 it transforms lives and leaves more money in the pocket.\n\n\u201cThe mixture of legislation, pricing and our services has really helped in recent years. A lot of people have also chosen to quit themselves and buy over-the-counter medication. But we still have some distance to go.\u201d\n\nNearly 13,000 people have kicked the habit over the last three years \u2013 equating to two every hour \u2013 helping bring down smoking rate in the Lothians by 0.5 per cent a year.\n\nIn order to be classified as smoke free, smoking rates in the region need to come down to a fifth of the current level which sees about a quarter of adults smoke, and that is the ultimate aim.\n\nAnd with a recent poll finding 70 per cent of smokers want to quit \u2013 combined with a drive to prevent kids from starting up \u2013 there is every hope that we can make a big difference.\n\nBetter medication and rising numbers of support groups have played a huge role in helping in the fight so far.\n\nScottish Government initiatives including banning smoking in public places, raising the age limit, increasing tax on cigarettes to drive the price of the habit up and increasing education amongst youngsters have also helped fuel the success.\n\nAnd Dr Gorman believes that the improved support services are vital to the future, too, as there is increasing evidence that group-based quitting works best.\n\nSo called \u201copen groups\u201d, where people attend sessions at different levels of quitting, are proving especially effective as those who have successfully stopped help reinforce people who are at the difficult early stages.\n\nJust as key in the fight is educating children not to take up the habit, a stance which is shared by the majority of anti-smoking groups.\n\nJohn Watson, from Ash Scotland, said the smoking population has more than halved since the charity started 40 years ago and continues its downward trend.\n\nIn the 1970s, before the extent of health risks was fully known, it was considered \u201cthe normal thing to do\u201d, with 70 per cent of people in Scotland smoking compared with 24 per cent today.\n\nThis reduction has saved one million people in Scotland from greatly increased risks of cancer, heart disease, dementia, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses.\n\nSmoke-free public places and stricter regulations have massively helped but experts believe the best way to combat smoking is to stop youngsters from taking it up, with two-thirds of smokers starting when they were aged under 18.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a generation growing up who have never actually seen tobacco advertising so it doesn\u2019t have the same ubiquitous presence in society that it used to have because tobacco companies were some of the biggest advertisers, dominating sports and projecting an image they wanted to,\u201d said Mr Watson.\n\n\u201cYears ago it used to be that people didn\u2019t really make a conscious decision to smoke, they just went with the flow. I think we\u2019ve made a huge impact in terms of changing the culture so that it\u2019s no longer just something that you do.\n\n\u201cClearly there is still a lot to be done but improvements to education in children, government legislation and changing attitudes towards smoking is all helping the fight.\u201d\n\nScotland was the first country in the UK to introduce a ban on smoking in public places, and has also increased the sales age from 16 to 18, and banned vending machines and the display of smoking products in shops.\n\nIt has led the way on activity to introduce plain packaging, having set out its commitment in last year\u2019s Tobacco Strategy. This month the UK Government is expected to decide whether to introduce the policy.\n\nNow politicians and charities are rallying to back our campaign to continue the fight against smoking.\n\nPublic Health Minister Michael Matheson said: \u201cI fully support this campaign being launched by NHS Lothian, Community Pharmacy Scotland and the Evening News. Smoking is a scourge on Scotland\u2019s health and there\u2019s no better time to reflect on that than national No Smoking Day.\n\n\u201cEvery year, tobacco use contributes to 13,000 deaths and 56,000 hospital admissions. That is why we are committed to achieving our vision of smoke-free Scotland by 2034.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Tobacco Control Strategy recognises that Scotland\u2019s health service should be an exemplar in providing smoke-free environments by April 2015. I welcome NHS Lothian\u2019s early commitment to this.\n\n\u201cThe NHS also has a key role in helping smokers to quit and reducing health inequalities. It is no coincidence that people die younger in those areas with the highest smoking rates.\n\n\u201cThat is why our new HEAT (Health Improvement, Efficiency, Access to Services and Treatment) target is focused solely on delivering longer quits in our most deprived communities.\u201d\n\n\u2018WE HAVE A DUTY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE\u2019\n\nProfessor Alison McCallum is director of public health and health policy at NHS Lothian.\n\nSmoking is the largest single preventable cause of ill-health and premature death in Scotland and we all have a duty to try and tackle it head on.\n\nWe all know the harmful effects of tobacco and the considerable cost of treating smoking-related disease.

We have advisers both in the community and in our main hospitals, with specialist services for pregnant women and young people.\n\nWe offer open access support sessions which are free and take place in a range of venues and locations. Our advisers can also arrange for medication to help you stop smoking from your GP, all for free.\n\nWe also have a community pharmacy scheme which also provides stop smoking support. By using this service you are four times more likely to quit than by doing it on your own.\n\nWe are really pleased that over the last year, we have exceeded the three-year HEAT (Health Improvement, Efficiency, Access to Services and Treatment) target of 11,686 people successfully quitting at one month post quit in Lothian, with 12,842 individuals becoming smoke free across the region.\n\nLooking ahead, we will be working closely with community health partnerships and with local authorities and partners as we know the coming year\u2019s target of 1765 successful quits at 12 weeks post quit for those who are pregnant, have mental health issues and chronic disease, is ambitious.\n\nBut we are confident that we can meet this target by refocusing smoking cessation services across community and acute settings.\n\nWe want to help all those in Lothian who want to become smoke free.\n\nSo please come forward and be a part of the Smoke Free Lothian campaign.\n\nSUPPORT AND ADVICE TO GIVE UP\n\nFree support to stop smoking is available across the Lothians.\n\nYou can get information about your local stop smoking services from Smokeline on 0800 84 84 84, or visit www.canstopsmoking.com where you can also chat online with a trained adviser.\n\nNHS stop smoking services are available throughout the Lothians.

A hint of banana nut bread e-juice lingered in the air one recent afternoon as patrons gathered around a low table to chat and vape, or sidled up to the inviting bar for help from a knowledgeable \"vapologist.\"\n\nPlaces like The Henley are a rarity, even in New York. But \"vaping\" itself has had astonishing growth \ufffd in just eight years or so, the number of enthusiasts around the world has grown from a few thousand to millions. Believed by some to be the invention of a Chinese pharmacist, vaping now has its own YouTube gurus, trade associations, lobbyists, online forums and vapefests for meet-ups centered on what enthusiasts consider a safer alternative to the \"analog,\" their name for tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration plans to regulate e-cigarettes but has not yet issued proposed rules. Right now, the agency simply states on its website that \"e-cigarettes have not been fully studied so consumers currently don't know the potential risks of e-cigarettes,\" including how much nicotine or other chemicals are inhaled, or if e-cigs \"may lead young people to try ... conventional cigarettes.\"\n\nWhether vaping helps regular smokers quit or leads non-smokers to nicotine addiction isn't known. Vaping may be safer \ufffd there are differing opinions \ufffd but it isn't necessarily cheap.\n\nWill Hopkins, a 21-year-old dog walker in black leather jacket and skull ring, visits Henley four or five times a week. He smoked a pack of full-strength Marlboros a day for eight years, until he took up vaping. The same goes for his buddy, 20-year-old photographer Will Gallagher, who has been vaping for two years and is fond of his brass mod, a cylindrical device that's larger than a cigarette and decorated with a tiger and Chinese lettering.\n\n\"I think both of us have poured in probably a little over a thousand\" dollars, Gallagher said of their equipment. \"I like the exclusivity of vaping. I like to keep changing up my stuff.\"\n\nThe Wills are into rebuilding tanks and rewiring coils, scouting new e-liquid flavors and adjusting their devices, which can cost up to $300 at Henley, to allow for more vapor, more flavor. But the co-owners of Henley count older smokers among their clientele as well.\n\nE-cigarettes are usually made of metal parts combined with plastic or glass and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They heat the liquid nicotine solution, creating vapor that quickly dissipates when exhaled. The vapor looks like tobacco smoke and can feel like tobacco smoke when taken into the lungs at varying strengths, from no nicotine up to 24 milligrams or more.\n\nIn 2006, sellers of all things vape worked primarily online or via kiosks in shopping malls. Now there are more than 250 brands and devices that can cost mere dollars for a case of \"cigalikes,\" which resemble the real thing, to a gold-and-diamond unit the size of a fountain pen that was reportedly made for a Russian oil tycoon and cost about $900,000.\n\nWhether vaping is cheaper than a cigarette habit is up to how much is spent on equipment and liquids and how often one vapes. A 15-milliliter bottle of liquid at Henley can go for $12 and may be roughly the equivalent of four packs of cigarettes, depending on the strength of both liquid and leaf cigarette, among other factors like how many puffs a smoker takes in. Rechargeable devices require batteries \ufffd another expense \ufffd and a starter kit for reuse that comes with a device can run around $66.\n\nBy comparison, the cost of a 20-cigarette pack of regular cigarettes can range from about $5 to about $15, depending on state tax and the type of location where they're purchased.\n\nSome cities and states have already moved to ban public use the way they do tobacco, and some states forbid the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. Critics believe e-cigs may serve as a tobacco gateway for uninitiated young people. \"It may be smoking e-cigarettes, but it's still smoking,\" said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who was one of four senators to fire off a scathing letter to NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after a spoof on e-cigs aired during the Golden Globes in January.\n\nProponents argue that vaping isn't only safe but is helping people quit smoking. The Henley has a white \"wall of doom,\" where it lists in big black letters the numerous tars and chemicals found in tobacco cigarettes, but absent in e-cig use if one is careful about the liquids purchased.\n\n\"What's so beautiful about this product is we can take people from a high level of nicotine down to zero, down to nothing, so they're just vaping basically water and flavoring,\" said Henley co-owner Talia Eisenberg.\n\nShe scoffs at the notion that child-friendly flavors of e-liquids \ufffd Watermelon Wave and Frozen Lime Drop, for instance \ufffd were created to lure teens. And she rejects the idea that e-cig companies should be banned from advertising on TV, as tobacco companies were more than 40 years ago.\n\nWhile e-liquids and vaping supplies lack oversight and long-term research, they are readily available to all ages online, and at gas stations, bodegas and many drug stores. But Henley doesn't serve those under 18 \ufffd a voluntary decision. Would it make more sense to help people give up nicotine \ufffd an addictive substance \ufffd altogether?\n\n\"Sure, but how's that workin' for the country so far? How are they doin' with that? We're talking in terms of serious harm reduction,\" said Eisenberg's business partner, Peter Denholtz. His mother died of lung cancer two years ago; he himself smoked cigarettes for 36 years, but has been vaping for four years.\n\nSome vapers, like Hopkins and Gallagher, find fun in tinkering with the paraphernalia. Denholtz likens them to older DIY enthusiasts who once whiled away their time on Heathkits, those all-inclusive boxes of parts that could be turned into TV receivers, amateur radios or stereo speakers.\n\n\"There's a whole subculture coming up. They're very into all of the different devices. They rewire and rebuild and use different materials for drawing up the juice. It's unbelievable what they've turned it into,\" he said.\n\nDenholtz and others said vaping, to many, is merely a less harmful activity than tobacco smoking that duplicates the most pleasurable aspects and offers a communal feel like hookah use and cigar bars.\n\nXavier Armand, 25, has been vaping for a little more than three years and owns an advertising and marketing firm that is helping Henley put together a \"liquid of the month club,\" along the lines of mail-order fruit of the month.\n\n\"I always kind of knew smoking was bad for me. My mom was a smoker, but I was never going to look into the patch or the gum or anything,\" Armand said. \"At the end of the day, the best part about smoking is the smoke part. And that oral fixation is kind of a big thing as well. I consider my agency the 2014 version of 'Mad Men.' We all sit around there and instead of smoking cigarettes everyone is smoking e-cigs.\"\n\nMuch as movie stars made tobacco smoking seem glamorous in the 1930s and '40s, celebrities have helped fuel interest in vaping.\n\nAt the Golden Globes, Leonardo DiCaprio was shown vaping away in the audience. The actor told The Associated Press recently he vapes to \"relieve the stress of life.\"\n\nOther celebrities have signed on as paid e-cig endorsers, including co-host of \"The View,\" Jenny McCarthy, and actor Stephen Dorff, both of whom push Blu, a big player in e-cigs that was recently bought by Big Tobacco's Lorillard.\n\nDorff, who took up smoking 20 years ago, stuck to Blu's talking points in a recent interview. He described how vaping offers him the freedom to smoke where regular cigarettes are frowned upon.\n\nBut wouldn't his loved ones like to see him quit nicotine for good?\n\n\"Ah, probably yeah,\" laughed Dorff, \"but there's a lot of bad things in the world, you know. The one thing that I've always enjoyed is smoking. I consider myself a smoker.\"", "735": "Given just how well established anti-smoking campaigns in Britain now are, many of today\u2019s smokers, and younger smokers in particular, have taken up the habit with at least some awareness of the damaging consequences of smoking on their long-term health. And despite these campaigns, the number of people smoking is still too high \u2013 particularly in Scotland, where, according to the Scottish Health Survey, one in four adults continues to smoke every day compared with around one in five in England and Wales.\n\nIn comparison to some of the more complex messages that public health campaigns need to get across, such as how many minutes a week we should all be active or how many units of alcohol we should be drinking, the message about tobacco harm is simple. So there is clearly more work to be done and the reasons behind smoking uptake still need to be fully understood.\n\nThe big picture\n\nEach year, tobacco use is associated with around a quarter of all deaths in Scotland. It accounts for 56,000 hospital admissions, and costs NHS Scotland \u00a3400m in treating smoking-related illnesses. It\u2019s an issue that bears consequences not only on those who smoke, but for Scottish society and its economy.\n\nSince the Scottish Health Survey began in 1995, smoking among adults has declined by nearly 10%. The number of cigarettes being smoked has fallen too, from an average of 15-a-day to just over 12. Almost a third (29%) of those who smoke every day are between 25 and 44, making them the largest proportion of smokers.\n\nVast inequalities exist though. Those living in the country\u2019s most deprived areas are more than three times as likely as those living in areas of least deprivation to smoke.\n\nIn March 2013, the Scottish government published Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation, an ambitious new tobacco control strategy that aims to create a smoke-free Scotland by 2034. The strategy puts Scotland right up there as a world leader on tobacco control. The standardisation of packaging of tobacco products, prohibition of tobacco vending machines, and a restriction on the display of all tobacco and smoking-related products as laid out in the strategy will also all serve to help undermine the marketing efforts of tobacco companies.\n\nThe first of the strategy\u2019s milestones is to reduce prevalence to 17% by 2016. We therefore have a few more years to wait before we get a sense of just how ambitious the aim for a smoke-free generation is. It should be taken as read that the tobacco industry are watching on with great interest.\n\nE-cigarette bans\n\nThe increased profile and availability of e-cigarettes has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works. Are they a stepping stone to tobacco use or if properly regulated could they act as a useful alternative to cigarettes? The long-term effects of e-cigarettes are not yet known. They may in time prove to be a useful quitting aid but as yet there is little evidence to support this. In the meantime, sales of e-cigarettes have increased by 340% in the past year while in the same period sales of licensed nicotine replacement products has slowed.\n\nThe danger lies in e-cigarettes use, or \u201cvaping\u201d, becoming a way of simply replacing one habit, proven to be damaging to health, with an alternative habit, about which little is currently known. Until we know more about their long-term health effects then perhaps the focus should be on discouraging habitual nicotine use more generally. It\u2019s encouraging to see that Glasgow\u2019s Commonwealth Games is the latest event to have banned the use of e-cigarettes from its venues in the same way tobacco smoking has been banned. This follows on from initiatives by other organisations including ScotRail, Starbucks and Wetherspoons pubs, none of whom allow \u201cvaping\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve also changed the Scottish Health Survey in 2014 to include questions on e-cigarette use for the first time. This means we will soon have robust data on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in Scotland, how it varies across different groups in society and how it relates to other health behaviours.\n\nA recent EU Directive will also clarify the status of the e-cigarette as a product. The framework allows products to \u201copt in\u201d to medicines regulation or, failing that, be subject to a range of new controls which include safety and quality requirements as well as restrictions around advertising. With legislation to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under 18s already passed in England and Wales, it is likely that Scotland will follow soon.\n\nThere are currently also no specific guidelines governing e-cigarette advertising but the Committee of Advertising Practice recently launched a public consultation on the marketing of e-cigarettes after one prime time advert attracted over 1,000 complaints. The consultation ends in April and any new rules arising out of the consultation are expected to be implemented soon after.\n\nGood news\n\nThe good news is that, according to a recent survey by Ash Scotland, Smoking among young teenagers is at its lowest level since 1990, an indication, perhaps, that this generation has taken more notice of \u2013 or been perhaps been more exposed to \u2013 effective anti-smoking campaigning.\n\nWe know from the latest Scottish Health Survey that 73% of smokers would like to stop and 41% have tried to quit on at least three occasions, so most smokers clearly want to change their behaviour. The challenge is to help and support these people give up, protecting others from second-hand exposure and fostering an environment where young people in Scotland do not want to take up smoking. In tandem with this is the challenge for the health community to figure out where e-cigarettes fit in with this in regards nicotine addiction and harm reduction.", "736": "Published by the Pirate FM News Team at 7:01am 12th March 2014.\n\nA report warns one in three Cornish smokers is wracked with guilt they could let down their families by dying early.\n\n\n\nA survey reveals many fear they will miss things like weddings or the birth of grandchildren.\n\n\n\nOn No Smoking Day one Cornish smoker has told Pirate FM \"I wish I never started.\"\n\nJohn Woodward is from Brazacott near Egloskerry and first lit up at sixteen: \"One shouldn't have regrets in life but probably starting to smoke was a regret. Once you get hooked on tobacco you continue.\n\nI've tried patches, I've tried nicotine substitutes but there is nothing as strong as willpower.\n\n\"At the end of the day it's willpower and determination that makes you stop.\"\n\nThe survey of more than 1,000 people across the southwest shows more than 1 in 3 smokers (36%) in Cornwall are worried they will experience regret about smoking when facing early death. A third of smokers (32%) fear they will let down those they hold closest by dying early.\n\n\n\nThe research also reveals high levels of anxiety amongst the families and friends of smokers with nearly half of Cornish families and friends (48%) saying they worry their loved one will regret continuing to smoke when faced with an early death.\n\nNearly 1 in 3 people with a smoking relative or friend (28%) are most worried they wouldn\u2019t live long enough to celebrate the joy of major family events such as weddings and the births of children or grandchildren. An overwhelming 7 out of 10 (77%) of smokers\u2019 families and friends in Cornwall want them to quit.\n\n\n\nIn Cornwall, an estimated 92,910 adults still smoke and, in the coming year, around 1,030 are predicted to die of smoking-related diseases.\n\n\n\nFiona Andrews, Director of Smokefree South West, said: \u201cThis survey confirms that the fear of dying early is very real \u2013 not only amongst smokers but amongst their loved ones too.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe risk is big. Half of all smokers will die early as a result of smoking. It is easy to put things off, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. As part of our \u2018Be There Tomorrow\u2019 campaign, we are urging people in the South West to use No Smoking Day this week to quit the habit before it\u2019s too late. Get in touch with your local NHS Stop Smoking Service for practical support and advice that has already helped hundreds of thousands of people in the South West to break free of tobacco.\u201d\n\n\n\nFelicity Owen, Director of Public Health for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, added: \u201cThese are hard-hitting figures and show how seriously people are taking the consequences of smoking. The good news is that there is plenty of support available locally to help people who want to make that positive decision to quit, for the sake of themselves and their loved ones. Giving up with help is far more effective than trying to do it alone, and the Stop Smoking Team can increase smokers\u2019 chance of being successful.\u201d", "737": "by Ken Quintanilla\n\nGuam - Electronic cigarettes have become increasingly popular throughout the nation and it's no different here on Guam. But because they're highly unregulated, it's fallen into the hands of our island's youth. Legislation aims to prevent just that.\n\nSenator Dennis Rodriguez Jr. says while there's still a lot of unknown information about electronic cigarettes, it's better to air on the side of caution. \"When it comes to the protection of children and minors, this is the way we would like to go and protect them,\" he said.\n\nBill 264 would prohibit the sale or distribution of e-cigarettes to minors. Chuck Tanner from the Guam Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalition dispelled the several myths people may have about e-cigarettes one of which is that it's safer. \"Non-smokers of tobacco products may be at risk to addition for smoking electronic cigarettes in addition, although electronic cigarettes don't generate smoke via burning tobacco it does not mean it's not safer to use to conventional cigarettes,\" he said.\n\nPeter Cruz from the Tobacco Control Team of the Non-Communicable Disease Consortium says its this kind of misguided information that has caused the surge of popularity in e-cigarettes. Cruz stresses the main ingredient of e-cigarettes is still nicotine. \"Currently, the CDC has an estimate of 25 percent of high school students have used electronic cigarette big tobacco companies have found yet another method of delivery specifically aimed for the younger generation of society the absence of regulatory monitoring has put this population at dire risk it's accessibility, simplicity of operation and endless amount of flavors or commonly known as e-juicing has made this product so popular with the youth,\" he said.\n\nThe current usage of e-cigarettes has been reported to be highly prevalent among Guam's middle and high school students. And for Public Health director James Gillan, he believes Bill 264 needs to be stronger. \"This does not go far enough, it's a tobacco product, it's been deemed to be a tobacco product by FDA and I think we ought to tax it as such,\" he said.\n\nGillan has already prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in any Public Health building. And while those who sell e-cigarettes were against the taxing suggestion, Vape Guam owner Evan Diras says even without the regulations, he's treated e-cigarettes like other tobacco products and doesn't sell to minors. \"I can speak for the rest of the other stores that are open, we all agreed that we don't sell to minors before this thing ever came up yes, we see a lot of minors using the e-cigarettes, but I think its beyond our control,\" he said.\n\nGillan meanwhile says the FDA is set to roll out regulations in late spring. A number of states like California, Colarado and Maryland have passed measures banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors whereas Hawaii, Iowa and New York have pending legislation under consideration.", "738": "Watchdog rules that Ten Motives' claim to be 'the healthier smoking alternative' was not substantiated in its advertising\n\nAn advert for an e-cigarette brand has been banned after the advertising watchdog ruled that claims including that it was \"the healthier smoking alternative\" could not be substantiated.\n\nWednesday's ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority comes as it looks to introduce new regulations for e-cigarette marketing to clear up uncertainty in the market.\n\nThe leaflet for Ten Motives' disposable electronic cigarettes claimed they were \"the healthier smoking alternative\" and \"because it contains no tar or cancerous toxins, you can still enjoy smoking without worrying about the effects on your health\".\n\nThe ad was challenged over whether these claims could be substantiated.\n\nIn its defence, Ten Motives argued that e-cigarettes were a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, saying that its product contained none of the 4,000 or so harmful toxins and carcinogens found in conventional tobacoo-based products.\n\nIt pointed out that regulator Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had confirmed that it was acceptable to refer to its products as a healthier alternative.\n\nIt also cited a briefing document from the public health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health) that stated \"people smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar\".\n\nTen Motives also provided links to presentations given at an e-cigarette summit in November 2013 at the Royal Society, which it said had been attended by recognised international scientific authorities on smoking, including the MHRA.\n\nIt highlighted quotes and presentations that it said supported the ad's claims, including a science-based independent presentation, \"Nicotine safety in the context of e-cigarette use and tobacco dependance\".\n\nIn its ruling, the ASA noted the two claims in the ad were understood to mean the Ten Motive's products were less harmful than conventional cigarettes.\n\nBut it ruled that the ad should be banned, as although it acknowledged the quote from Ash, it noted it was not supported by further documentation or substantiation showing the effects of e-cigarettes or the Ten Motives products specifically.\n\nLikewise, it said the summit presentations did not deal specifically with Ten Motives products.\n\nIn its ruling, the ASA concluded the claims \"the healthier smoking alternative\" and \"you can still enjoy smoking without worrying about the effects on your health\" were misleading and the ad should be banned.\n\n\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

This year's No Smoking Day is urging part-time smokers to quit too, writes Abi Jackson\n\nEVERY year since the campaign began in 1983, No Smoking Day has been rallying smokers to stub out for good and charities in Ireland and Britain are hoping to inspire even higher numbers this year.\n\nBut it's not just those with 40-a-day habits being targeted; this year the focus is shifting to include part-time and social smokers. Because while the past few decades have seen a wealth of research highlighting the dangers of being a heavy smoker, the increased risk of certain cancers being most notable, there has been very little emphasis on 'light' smokers.\n\nA recent study, published this year in the Smoking In Britain journal, looking at non-daily smoking and common misconceptions, revealed that awareness of potential health risks of part-time smoking is low. Only a quarter (25 per cent) of the non-daily smokers surveyed said they were worried that cigarettes might be damaging their health, while the significant majority were unconcerned.\n\nMike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), isn't surprised by the findings. \"People often think, including some doctors actually, 'Well, if you only smoke a bit, it's not going to do you too much harm',\" he says. \"Part of that is driven by the lack of evidence; most research is done on people who smoke more. \"We don't say enough about part-time smoking.\"\n\nThere may be less data on the health risks of part-time smoking, but that doesn't mean none exists. A major 2005 study, which followed thousands of men and women from\n\nthe 1970s through to 2002, looking at the consequences of smoking between one and four cigarettes a day, revealed heart-disease deaths were three times higher than in people who didn't smoke at all. These two studies alone are cause for concern for the BHF. \"I think we can say with confidence that, one, there is damage being done [if you're a part-time smoker] and, two, awareness of that is pretty low,\" Dr Knapton says. \"So this is an important message to get out there.\"\n\nThere may be 'guidelines' for sensible consumption levels for alcohol, for instance, but when it comes to smoking, Dr Knapton's view is clear - there is no such thing as a 'safe' lower limit. \"An unequivocal no,\" he says. \"There's no safe limit as far as we're aware.\"\n\nThere are more than one million part-time smokers in Britain and Northern Ireland. The non-daily smoking survey also found that just one in seven (15 per cent) of them feel they're addicted to cigarettes, compared to one in three daily smokers.\n\nNicotine is a highly addictive substance, however, and whether or not somebody experiences powerful physical cravings, smoking can be a very tough habit to break.\n\n\"It becomes a social or psychological habit too - you have a cup of tea and a cigarette, for instance, and that becomes difficult to change over time,\" Dr Knapton says.\n\nReasons for part-time smoking vary. Some say it's a stress reliever, or to help them cope with they're anxious. For many, it's a social thing - lighting up with colleagues during a work break, joining in with other smokers on a night out; having something to hold and 'do' can be a comfort in itself.\n\nDespite the low number of 'light' smokers admitting to health worries, two in five (40 per cent) said they've tried to quit in the past year.\n\nn continues overleaf", "740": "Chancellor urged to raise tobacco taxes \u2013 a call echoed by ex-smokers\n\nHealth campaigners and academic experts are marking this year\u2019s No Smoking Day by calling on the Chancellor to raise the tax on cigarettes by 5% above inflation in next week\u2019s Budget. This coincides with research released today by the British Heart Foundation showing that nearly half (42%) of ex-smokers said that raising the tax on tobacco would help other smokers to quit.\n\nIn a submission endorsed by 80 health and welfare organisations as well as Directors of Public Health, ASH and the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies are calling for the following measures:\n\n\u00d8 Introduce a tobacco tax escalator of 5% above inflation for this and subsequent years.\n\n\u00d8 Reduce the growing price differential between the most expensive and cheapest\n\ncigarettes to discourage down-trading\n\n\u00d8 Increase the tax on hand-rolled tobacco (HRT) by introducing a larger tax escalator of 15% above inflation until tax on HRT is equivalent to that on manufactured cigarettes.\n\n\u00d8 Support the development of regulations to introduce plain, standardised\n\npackaging of tobacco packs.\n\n\u00d8 Update the Government\u2019s anti-smuggling strategy\n\nDeborah Arnott, Chief Executive of health charity ASH said:- \u201cRaising the price of tobacco through taxation is the most effective way of reducing smoking and saving lives. Increasing taxes is a win-win for Government: it raises much needed revenue and encourages smokers to quit a deadly addiction. That is why we are calling on the Chancellor to be bold and raise the tax by 5% above inflation to further motivate smokers to quit.\u201d\n\nProfessor Anna Gilmore, Professor of Public Health at the University of Bath and a UKCTAS Public Health Researcher the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, said:- \u201cTobacco companies constantly complain about tax rises while at the same time quietly increasing prices and amassing huge profits from the sale of a product that kills half their long-term customers. This shows there is scope for raising tobacco tax. Increasing taxes not only helps smokers to quit but also deters children from starting a life-long addiction.\u201d", "741": "An estimated one million people across the UK have swapped smoking for \u2018vaping\u2019. To mark national No Smoking Day, reporter Alexa Copeland swapped her pack of menthols for an e-cigarette to find out how they are helping so many people kick the habit.\n\nI have never wanted to give up smoking to be perfectly honest. Life can be miserable enough without depriving oneself of its simple pleasures and for me, pleasurable moments invariably involve cigarettes. Especially the one that gets you started in the morning. And the one with a relaxing cup of tea or a glass of wine at the end of the day, and the one that stops you cracking when you\u2019re nearing your stress limit. And, well, you get my point.\n\nI know it\u2019s not big, and it\u2019s certainly not clever, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed my cigarettes. And in a perverse way, the more we smokers are made to feel like social lepers through bans and regulation, the more my resolve strengthened to continue the habit. Smoking isn\u2019t illegal, it contributes billions to the treasury and the constant hounding of the sociable souls who indulge feels a bit too much like a Nanny State-sponsored witch-hunt for my liking. And that is something I like to rail against most passionately.\n\nAlas, I was forced to re-evaluate my attitude a couple of weeks ago when I was plagued with a chest infection almost matched in severity by my doctor\u2019s words. She did not explicitly link the infection with smoking, but her stern insinuation that I was setting myself up for a grim future of pain and breathlessness from ineffectual lungs was enough to make me seriously think about what I was doing to myself.\n\nBeing a somewhat reluctant quitter, I didn\u2019t much fancy my chances of giving up easily. Although I don\u2019t smoke heavily \u2013 around seven per day unless alcohol is involved \u2013 my habit stretches back over a decade and is truly ingrained in my daily routine. Nicotine patches and gum may work for some, but I knew I\u2019d miss the physical ritual of smoking, so I joined the tens of thousands of people around the country who are replacing their smoking with \u2018vaping\u2019.\n\nVaping is the term given to the use of electronic cigarettes; also known as vapourisers or e-cigs. These devices come in a range of styles offering different flavours and nicotine doses. E-cigs work by vapourising a liquid solution which contains nicotine, thus allowing users to effectively mimic taking a drag on a cigarette to get their nicotine hit. The \u2018smoke\u2019 exhaled is largely water vapour and e-cigs are marketed as a much safer alternative to conventional cigarettes as they do not contain tar or carcinogens.\n\nOne man keen to extol their virtues is businessman Alan O\u2019Neill who was quick to capitalise on the early popularity of the product. Mr O\u2019Neill bought his own vapouriser online about 18-months-ago and within 30 days his 30-a-day habit was history. He then set about bringing e-cigs to the North-East and now owns E-ciggy shops in Darlington, Stockton, Middlesbrough and Washington. He says business is growing from strength to strength as more and more smokers turn to vaping.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou get customers coming back to tell you how long they\u2019ve gone without a cigarette, while some come back to say thank you for helping them quit and it feels fantastic to get feedback like that. I\u2019ve found that a proportion of users want to quit completely, but a proportion are quite happy to just carry on using the e-cigs as an alternative to smoking. I switched because I wanted to stop the negative health and financial effects of smoking but I still wanted the pleasure of smoking. In that way it was a fantastic solution and I just thought this incredible product should be more widely available.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Mr O\u2019Neill and the estimated one million \u2018vapers\u2019 in Britain, uncertainty surrounds the product\u2019s future, with bodies such as the British Medical Association and World Health Organisation expressing safety concerns. The main issue is that unlike nicotine patches and gum, e-cigs are not regulated in the same way as medicines. This means there are no rules when it comes to the purity of the nicotine and so forth. Last month MEPs voted to restrict the availability of e-cigs in the future and it remains to be seen how many pubs and clubs will allow vaping on their premises if it is deemed to be harmful.\n\nFor me, switching to an e-cigarette has been unbelievably painless. In the three days since I started vaping I have had just two real cigarettes. I would normally have had at least 20 in that time. Maybe it\u2019s the novelty factor, or maybe, despite my protestations to the contrary, it was just the right time for me to give up, but whatever the reason I have no doubt that the e-cigarette has helped enormously. It fits into my routine in the same way that real cigarettes did and I find myself enjoying my \u2018e-cig moments\u2019 almost as much as I savored the real thing.\n\nAnd if the future of vapourising is threatened by government legislation and public bans, well, I still have something to rail against don\u2019t I? And I do believe I shall do that most passionately.", "742": "Smokers are being urged to ditched the cigarettes.\n\nToday (Wednesday, March 12) is No Smoking Day and cigarette fans can take an extra boost for their willpower with the knowledge that they will not be alone in taking up the challenge.\n\nThis year\u2019s No Smoking Day has a \u2018V for Victory\u2019 theme, which aims to inspire hundreds of thousands of smokers to win the fight against cigarettes.\n\nCentral Beds Council\u2019s Stop Smoking service will be on hand to help put smokers on the road to victory, providing information, support and encouragement to put together a personal battle plan so that they are in the best possible position to make a successful attempt to quit.\n\nCouncillor Andrew Turner, deputy executive member for social care, health and housing, said: \u201cStopping smoking is the first step to a longer and healthier life.\n\n\u201cI managed to quit three years ago after smoking for 40 years so if I can do it anyone can.\n\n\u201cI like having the extra pounds in my pocket and don\u2019t run out of puff or cough like I used to \u2013 and my wife tells me that my clothes no longer pong either so she is happier too.\n\n\u201cI urge you to give it a go as well and see what a difference not smoking could mean for you.\u201d\n\nIf you want to join the many smokers in Central Bedfordshire who in turn will be joining many others across the UK, you can quit for good with your free local Stop Smoking Service.\n\nCall 0800 013 0553 and press 1 to get information about your nearest clinic and book an appointment.

They are largely unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They come in flavors ranging from apple pie to white chocolate.\n\nCity Councilman Gary Kendrick, who brought the issue forward in January, reiterated his stance that e-cigarettes and similarly used hookah pens and pipes, with their sweet flavors and easy over-the-counter availability, entice kids and create future cigarette smokers. Hookah use with any tobacco product, weed or plant is already prohibited in enclosed public places and in certain outdoor public areas.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to stop these e-cigs in their track,\" Kendrick said, who added that \"having a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a pool.\"\n\nEl Cajon for years has had some of the most comprehensive smoking restrictions in San Diego County.\n\nSmoking is not allowed in any public place in El Cajon, including common areas in multi-unit residences; on city sidewalks, streets and stores; in common areas of malls; in enclosed and unenclosed areas of hotels, motels and places of business; or in bars, restaurants and public accommodations.

They also warned against the \"newest trend\" of using e-cigarettes as a means of inhaling high levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, from butane hash oil.\n\nCASA representatives also praised the city, which has for years been very active in regulating tobacco sales and restricting smoking in most public places.\n\n\"You're the leaders for public health,\" said Lorenzo Higley of CASA \"(The council has) demonstrated with your leadership that protecting El Cajon citizens is a priority.

They also say the devices are being used to smoke marijuana, hash oil and other illegal drugs.\n\nThat was part of the issue front and center for the county supervisors Tuesday, who voted 3-1 to equate electronic smoking devices with tobacco.\n\nSupervisor Dave Roberts said there are also too many unknowns about potential health problems to allow unrestricted use of e-cigs. He argued electronic cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use because they are primarily used to ingest nicotine.\n\n\u201cThe county should be a model, and I cannot support a product that promotes addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn May, the county will consider another layer to its policy by prohibiting all electronic smoking devices at all county facilities.\n\nSupervisor Bill Horn cast the lone \u201cno\u201d vote, citing e-cigarettes as a tool for people to quit regular cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIt is a knee-jerk reaction to something that is taking place and I don\u2019t think we should be telling adults you can\u2019t use these if you are trying to get off nicotine,\u201d Horn said.\n\nThe board\u2019s vote came after numerous speakers urged action and Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer, said sales of the products have tripled in recent years and that about 7 percent of middle and high school students are illegally using them.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Health and Safety Code makes it illegal to sell or furnish e-cigs to anyone under 18 and allows local jurisdictions to pass and enforce laws governing their distribution.\n\nThe fair board voted 6-0 to ban use of the products during the county fair, which opens June 7 and runs through July 6. The move comes after it banned smoking at the fair last year. The prohibition does not apply to Del Mar Thoroughbred Club races or fairgrounds\u2019 special events.\n\nBoard members said adding e-cigarettes to the policy was partly an issue of enforcement.\n\n\u201cI would feel sorry for the security personnel trying to distinguish cigarettes from e-cigarettes,\u201d said fair board vice president David Watson. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, we\u2019re going to do it 100 percent.\u201d\n\nIn El Cajon, the City Council vote was 4-1 with Mayor Bill Wells opposing.\n\nThe city will now require those-cigarette and related product sellers to get a license, as is the case with tobacco sellers.

Poor Leonardo DiCaprio, who has homes in LA and New York, will now be forced to stub out his smokeless cigarettes on both sides of the country.\n\nBut the craze for e-cigarettes hasn't just been taken up by the stars. New research shows that more than 50,000 Irish smokers are estimated to have made the switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes in a global industry worth in excess of \u20ac1.1 bn.\n\nGalway businessman Declan Connolly set up his electronic cigarette company, ezSmoke (ezsmoke.ie), two years ago after swapping to vaping following 27 years as a smoker.\n\n\"I bought a device online and people started asking me where I'd got it \u2013 that's how the business started,\" he explains.\n\nAlthough the first smokeless non-tobacco cigarette was patented as early as 1963, the modern device, which uses battery-generated cartridges to heat a liquid (usually infused with nicotine) and create a vapour, appeared around 2004 in China.\n\nDeclan Connolly reckons we're now into a third generation of electronic devices.\n\n\"The first generation was the disposable ones in the shops that look like cigarettes, now the more popular devices are those based around a rechargeable battery. But there's a third generation that's sprung up with enthusiasts creating coils and heating elements to make their own devices \u2013there are a lot of hobbyists out there.\"\n\nBut aside from the techies, the biggest fans of e-cigarettes are former smokers. Although the devices aren't sold as quit-smoking aids, Connolly admits his main demographic of buyers are people who have smoked for 10-30 years and want to get away from tobacco.\n\n\"One of the big appeals for these buyers is that when you inhale an e-cigarette you feel a bit of a 'kick' in the back of your throat,\" he explains. \"It also provides the hand-to-mouth ritual, and then there's the fact that most people starting off will try and find a flavour of e-liquid that replicates what they used to smoke.\"\n\nBut the close parallels between vapour cigarettes and the real thing has thrown up some problems with legislation.\n\nIn December, New York City banned e-cigarettes in all places where regular cigarettes are already prohibited.\n\nIn Dublin, DIT's health and safety department banned electronic cigarettes on campus in November. \"Reaction from students has been quite polarised,\" says Al McConnell, editor of The Edition, the college's independent newspaper which broke the story of the ban. \"It's also been difficult to enforce as e-cigarettes' popularity continues to rise. You can see that on campus, they're becoming more popular among students.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I think it's a tricky issue because of the inherent uncertainty around the products. The Students' Union is currently working on its own research into e-cigarettes before it takes any stance and I think the ban, and DIT's smoking policy, will have to be returned to when more is known about them.\"\n\nWhich is, of course, the greatest area of concern \u2013 in a new product, where the effects have not been measured over any lengthy period of time, who knows how safe vaping really is?\n\nThe Irish Cancer Society (ICS) has refused to endorse the product. Health Minister James Reilly has announced that he plans to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under 18s over concerns that puffing on a pseudo-cigarette could prove a gateway to smoking the real thing.\n\nIt's a fear, that ezSmoke's Declan Connolly, who doesn't sell to under 18s, strongly denies. \"I'd like to rubbish that idea that vaping is a gateway to smoking. If someone tried e-cigarettes, they would never become a smoker. Vaping tastes nicer and it's cheaper,\" he says.\n\n\"Health's a major reason why people turn to e-cigarettes over smoking. It's combustion that causes all the trouble in cigarettes but e-cigarettes have vapour, not smoke and there's no tar. Vaping won't re-normalise smoking because it's completely different.\"\n\nTobacco-related disease accounts for some 5,500 deaths in Ireland every year, with tobacco consumption the biggest cause of cancer and chest diseases and a significant factor in cardiovascular disease and exacerbated diabetes.\n\nBut eliminating tobacco doesn't necessarily mean nicotine infused e-cigarettes are healthy because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor that narrows the blood vessels, raises blood pressure and is also highly addictive.\n\n'In the absence of appropriate regulation and evidence, we can't recommend e-cigarettes,\" says Kevin O'Hagan, health promotion manager at the ICS. \"They may not have the many poisonous, cancer-causing chemicals that tobacco smoke has, but it's unclear what the long term health impacts are.\" He adds: \"E-cigarettes are marketed as recreational consumer products. They make no claims for quitting and they're not currently a proven form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT).\n\n\"Until their effectiveness as smoking cessation aids is established and we can be assured that they don't cause any harm to the user or any health risks of second-hand exposure, we're urging people to take caution in using them.\"\n\nUltimately the ICS would like to see e-cigarettes regulated under medicinal products or medical devices legislation, something retailers like Declan Connolly are keen to avoid.\n\n\"I'm all for regulation, there are some poorer quality products out there and people need to know that what they're inhaling is safe and approved,\" he explains.\n\n\"But I would hate e-cigarettes to go down the medicine regulation route because people who vape aren't sick.\"\n\nNor is he happy with the devices being included under the current EU Tobacco Products Directive, which may bring with it limitations on devices size and the amount of nicotine that can be included.\n\n\"I'd like to see e-cigarettes regulated under a separate category, because they're not a tobacco product, but it's a growing industry and pharmaceutical companies are lobbying viciously to get them made a medicine and tobacco companies are also lobbying \u2013 there are interesting times ahead.\"\n\n'All my family have switched to e-cigs'\n\nMum-of-two Myriam Prendergast (49) from Tipperary town was one of a family of smokers before she discovered vaping. Now they've all converted to e-cigarettes, she explains.\n\n\"I bought an electronic cigarette for my mum to try two years ago. She's 70 and had been a smoker all her life but since trying vaping, she's been off them.\n\n\"My dad switched to e-cigarettes too; so did my husband and my daughter \u2013 it was listening to all them sing their praises that persuaded me to give them a go.\n\n\"I haven't smoked a cigarette now in four months and when I went to the doctor to get my carbon monoxide levels checked, they'd gone down drastically.\n\n\"Instead of smoking a cigarette that has 4,000 chemicals in it, I'm inhaling a vapour that has three flavours and nicotine \u2013 and although I started off on 24mg of nicotine I'm now down to 16mg.\n\n\"I like how I still get the sensation of smoking a cigarette. I can have one with my morning coffee or after a meal and I'm not pulling my hair out wanting a smoke.\"\n\nIT consultant Hugh McCormick (53) from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, has saved \u20ac2,500 since switching from smoking to vaping last October.\n\nHe says: \"My main reason for making the switch was down to health concerns.

John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue. However, we are disappointed that his mid-biennium budget proposal falls far short of the strong action needed to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and reduce tobacco's terrible health and financial toll on Ohio.\n\nWe urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit. The tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children. Ohio must take strong action to prevent youth use of all forms of tobacco.\n\nTobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact. The proposal to increase the cigarette tax over a two year period, from $1.25 to $1.85 per pack, would have little to no effect on smoking rates and would be easily undercut by tobacco industry discounting schemes, such as coupons, buy one get one free deals, and temporary price cuts. We are pleased that the proposal equalizes the tax on all other tobacco products, but to impact public health, this tax should also be immediately enacted and not phased-in over a two-year period.\n\nThe Governor has taken a positive step forward by proposing to allocate $26.9 million from the Master Settlement Agreement to the Ohio Department of Health for tobacco prevention and cessation programs over a five year span. However, this amount still falls well short of the\n\n$132 million a year recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs should be restored at least to the level of $50 million a year that Ohio was providing before funding was severely cut in Fiscal 2009.\n\nOhio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut. In recent years, this progress has stalled and today Ohio has the 10th highest smoking rate in the country with 23.3 percent of adults smoking. The high school smoking rate is also higher than the nation as a whole at 21.1 percent. As a result, tobacco takes a huge health and financial toll on Ohio, claiming 17,700 lives each year and costing the state $5.6 billion annually in health care bills. Families and businesses alike pay a heavy price.\n\nGovernor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll. To have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs.", "748": "Big Tobacco should pay for high-risk smokers' CT scans\n\nWe are about to encounter a significant rise in annual healthcare costs, courtesy of Big Tobacco.\n\nRecently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force endorsed lung cancer screening with annual CT scans in high-risk smokers. This means that insurers will soon be required by law to fund these services, which screen for cancers caused by cigarettes, to the tune of $2 billion per year.\n\nThe tobacco industry, while fully aware that their products maim and kill multitudes of Americans daily, will happily shoulder none of the burden. Instead, while tobacco profits continue to soar, these millions of expensive CT scans will be paid for with hard-earned healthcare dollars.\n\nShouldn't Big Tobacco blood money be used to cover these costs?\n\nTobacco companies have historically absolved themselves of responsibility for these multitudes of deaths by arguing that smokers choose to smoke. This absurd position disregards the fact that the industry systematically employs all means at its disposal -- marketing experts, unscrupulous attorneys, \"scientists\" -- to obscure the facts regarding the known dangers of cigarettes so as to minimize tobacco avoidance and quit rates.\n\nTo date, government has turned a blind eye to Big Tobacco, an industry that continues to enjoy a historically lucrative run, despite the fact that they're literally killing us.\n\nIt seems that only the court of public opinion can provide the leverage necessary to extract the enormous debt owed by these nefarious corporations.\n\nPerhaps it's time to write our leaders in Congress to ask that they send this $2 billion annual bill to Big Tobacco. After all, they can afford it.\n\nLarry Leibowitz\n\nhealth director\n\nRedding", "749": "In the 50 years since the Surgeon General first reported on the dangers of smoking tobacco, much has been done to effect change. At the time of the first Surgeon General\u2019s Report, 42 percent of American adults smoked. Today, only 18 percent do.\n\nThat\u2019s according to the 50th Anniversary Surgeon General\u2019s Report released in January.\n\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to list tobacco use as the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. And young people today continue to pick up the habit.\n\nA discussion about new guidelines to help communities control tobacco use and addiction.\n\nLast month Washington University\u2019s Center for Public Health Systems Science (CPHSS) released new tobacco control policy guidelines nationwide targeted at helping states and local communities reduce tobacco use.\n\nThe focus is policy, not education, because that has been determined to have a broader effect, said Douglas Luke, the director of CPHSS and a professor at the Brown School of Social Work.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nThe main recommendations of CPHSS tobacco control guidelines are to raise the price of tobacco products and to implement smoke-free policies.\n\n\u201cFewer people smoke, fewer people start smoking if the price is higher,\u201d Luke said. While people who are addicted may still buy tobacco products even as the price goes up, a higher cost discourages new smokers from picking up the habit, he explained.\n\nThat\u2019s why Missouri\u2019s low tobacco tax rate worries him.\n\n\u201cWe have the lowest tax rate on cigarettes in the entire country. And it just makes it easier for people to start because the cost of starting is much less compared to other places,\u201d Luke said.\n\nDespite the low tax rate, Missouri has about the same percent of smokers as the national average, 19 percent. But St. Louis City has a higher concentration of smokers, sitting at 26 percent, Luke said.\n\nAnd Missouri is doing a bit better on the second half of the policy recommendations. While the state does not have a smoke-free policy, some local communities do.\n\n\u201cAs recent as the early 90s very few people in the United States lived in communities that had smoke-free policies, less than one percent. As of this year, about half the country lives in either in a state or a community that has strong smoke-free policies.\u201d Luke said.\n\nE-Cigarettes\n\nAnother focus of the policy guidelines is youth prevention, because most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18.\n\nThe newest challenge on that front is the e-cigarette, said Luke, with many young people already switching over to the new non-tobacco version of the cigarette, which releases nicotine in vapor form.\n\nAccording to Luke, the concern about the e-cigarette is two-fold. First, they often aren\u2019t subject to regulations. And second, they may prolong the use of nicotine even if the initial health risks are lower.\n\nAdding Years to a Child\u2019s Life\n\nThe thing about tobacco use, said Luke, is that not only is it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, but it is a choice that has a direct impact on how long you live.\n\nIf you can prevent a child from starting smoking, you can add 4 to 8 years to their life, he said.\n\nRelated Information\n\n1-800-QUIT-NOW\n\nFree hotline in Missouri which connects callers with smoking cessation programs.\n\nSt. Louis on the Air provides discussion about issues and concerns facing the St. Louis area.

Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do to improve your health.\n\nNo Smoking Day merged with the BHF three years ago, and it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s biggest annual health awareness campaigns. Last year an estimated one million people attempted to quit on the day. At BHF Scotland we work tirelessly to reduce tobacco-related illness and death, and research from stop smoking services shows that smokers are four times more likely to be effective in quitting if they use specialist stop smoking support and treatment.\n\nThe theme for our campaign this year is \u201cV for Victory\u201d, because we recognise that quitting is a battle against addiction.

And I explained to them that No Smoking Day is not about forcing anyone to quit, but about helping those who have decided they\u2019d like to try.\n\nIt amazes me to think that decades ago smoking in the workplace and, more recently than that, in bars and clubs, was not only acceptable but seen as the norm. In 20 years\u2019 time it would be wonderful to look back and remember, with astonishment, the days when it was normal to see someone buying cigarettes and smoking at all.

Past laws to ban such selling of tobacco cigarettes have been struck down by courts on the grounds that they would have unfairly prohibited a company's trying to sell to adult customers. ...\n\nApart from disallowing ads that begin \"Hey, kids!,\" it has proved tough to come up with ways to restrict marketing that pass legal muster. ...\n\nRaising awareness ... may ultimately be more successful in reining in the popularity of e-devices than attempts to stifle their marketing.\n\n\u2014Hartford Courant", "752": "Electronic cigarettes are now on par with tobacco smokes when it comes to their use in San Diego County.\n\nThe county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to bring all electronic smoking and vapor devices under the same policies governing cigarette smoking cessation and reduction efforts\n\nThe move comes as several cities in the region and the San Diego County Fair Board have enacted or are considering new restrictions on electronic smoking devices in public settings.\n\nSupervisors Ron Roberts (who was absent because of a scheduling conflict) and Dave Roberts had requested a broadening of the county's policies toward smoking to include all the electronic devices that have emerged in recent years.

But he also touched upon other topics, including friction in relations with Washington, corruption, pollution, and the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines aircraft.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economy faced difficulties, Li suggested Beijing would not let growth slip too far. The government has targetted a rise of GDP in 2014 of 7.5 percent after actual growth last year of 7.7 percent.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have the ability, and all the means, to ensure that economic growth will stay within a reasonable range this year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also signalled the government will allow further debt defaults after Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co Ltd failed last Friday to pay an interest payment on its five-year bonds.\n\nThe first default on a domestic bond was hailed by experts as a landmark that will impose more market discipline, a break from the past when bonds enjoyed an implicit guarantee because the government would bail out troubled firms to ensure stability.\n\nGrowth in Chinese corporate debt has been unprecedented. A Thomson Reuters analysis of 945 listed medium and large non-financial firms showed total debt soared by more than 260 percent to 4.74 trillion yuan ($777.3 billion) between December 2008 and September 2013.\n\n\u201cWe are reluctant to see defaults of financial products, but some cases are hard to avoid,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe must enhance oversight and solve problems in a timely way to ensure no systemic and regional risks.\u201d\n\nLi said financial and fiscal reforms are among top priorities this year, reinforcing market expectations that long-awaited changes to liberalise bank deposit rates and efforts rein in local government debt could be in the pipeline.\n\nChinese leaders unveiled plans last year for sweeping reforms aimed at transforming the economy\u2019s reliance on investment and exports, which have fuelled double-digit growth for three decades, to one that leans more on services and consumption. It included allowing market forces to play a bigger part in the economy.\n\nPRIORITY ON JOBS\n\nThe signs of a slowdown in the economy this year have raised worries among some investors that China will miss the 7.5 percent growth target.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is really quite weak,\u201d Wei Yao, China economist for Societe Generale said after Thursday\u2019s data. \u201cQ1 GDP growth is probably already below 7.5 percent. The government will probably do some easing.\u201d\n\nYao said she expected the central bank to reduce bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points. Major banks currently have to put aside a fifth of their cash as reserves and such a measure would represent the central bank\u2019s strongest policy easing since 2012.\n\nSources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters earlier this week that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if economic growth slowed further. But they said policy action may only happen in the second quarter.\n\nLi skillfully dodged a question on how far Beijing would let economic growth slip before it steps in with policy measures to support activity. Still, he hinted at tolerance for below-target growth, as long as enough new jobs are created.\n\n\u201cThe GDP growth target is around 7.5 percent. \u2018Around\u2019 means there is some flexibility and we have some tolerance,\u201d he said, adding that the lower limit on growth must ensure job creation.\n\nFinance Minister Lou Jiwei said last week that China can slightly miss the 7.5 percent growth target as long as enough jobs are created.\n\nHowever, Xu Shaoshi, the head of the pro-growth National Development and Reform Commission, said on Wednesday that the 7.5 percent target would be the lower limit for the government.\n\nBeijing wants to create 10 million new jobs in 2014 and Li has said that the economy must grow 7.2 percent annually to do that. Some 13 million new jobs were created last year when the economy grew 7.7 percent.\n\nPremier Li said the government will take a differentiated approach to cool the property market, rather than using one-size-fits-all policies used by his predecessors that have largely failed to calm real estate inflation.\n\n\u201cWe need to apply differentiated property measures in different cities based on different types of demand and local conditions,\u201d Li said.\n\nBut on government corruption, Li had an unequivocal answer.\n\n\u201cWe will show zero tolerance for corrupt behaviour and corrupt officials.

On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously.\" Li further explained to the press.\n\nThe government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.\n\n\"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle.\" Li said.", "764": "China\u2019s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it\u2019s also had one very nasty side effect \u2013 a massive increase in pollution.\n\nUntil recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.\n\nBut over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country\u2019s economic transformation.\n\nA popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a \u201cwar on pollution\u201d.\n\nThis will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?\n\nA pack-a-day cigarette habit \u2013 even for non-smokers\n\nChina\u2019s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.\n\nCoal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.\n\nNowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China\u2019s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.\n\nThings are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.\n\nThe air is bad, but the water is worse\n\nChina\u2019s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.\n\nAs a result, over half of China\u2019s rivers are classed as \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it \u201cgrim\u201d.\n\nAs with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can\u2019t open their windows because of the smell. They can\u2019t even use the water to irrigate their crops \u2013 it poisons them.\n\nThe Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of \u2018cancer villages\u2019, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.\n\nAlongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood \u2013 which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.\n\nThe other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.\n\nFixing the problem \u2013 and how to profit\n\nSo what will the \u2018war on pollution\u2019 involve?\n\nChina admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.\n\nFirstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as \u2018scrubbers\u2019 for power plants.\n\nIt seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can\u2019t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.\n\nThere are several ways to profit, and we\u2019ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).\n\nBut there\u2019s one quite obvious play that we\u2019ve covered a few times recently \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That\u2019s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.\n\n\u2022 This article is taken from our free daily investment email, Money Morning.

To say this is a real press conference is something of an overstatement \u2014 like all government events, it is stage-managed, with all questions carefully vetted and selected in advance. But it is still a rare opportunity to at least hear directly from the otherwise unapproachable Chinese leadership. And though Li offered few details (as usual) and his language was vague (as usual), he did indicate that the government\u2019s attitude toward the economy is changing in extremely important ways for the nation\u2019s future.\n\nHere we can find good news in the Premier\u2019s bad news. The substance of Li\u2019s comments suggested that China is heading for a rough patch, but he and his policy team are not going to pump it up at all costs. \u201cWe are not pursuing GDP growth alone,\u201d he declared. This is an especially meaningful statement. In the past, China\u2019s government felt compelled to supersize growth rates as soon as the economy showed any signs of faltering, as they did after the 2008 global financial crisis. But that has led to all sorts of problems for the economy \u2014 rising levels of debt, a shaky financial system and unhealthy excess capacity. Economists almost universally agree that Beijing has to start balancing its desire for growth with tough reforms to fix the negative fallout from that growth. In that way, China\u2019s economy would be set upon a more stable future.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Though he confessed that \u201cChina\u2019s economy still faces severe challenges this year,\u201d he went on to admit that \u201cthe space for wielding fiscal and monetary policy has limits, and [macroeconomic] regulation certainly faces many hard choices.\u201d Instead, Li acknowledged that the economy has serious problems that must be addressed \u2014 terrible pollution, too much debt, inefficiency \u2014 and that the government needs to strike a balance between ensuring economic expansion and repairing its weaknesses. \u201cWe need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions,\u201d Li said. \u201cOnly a sharpened ax can cut through firewood.\u201d\n\nHowever, the question he left open is: How sharp is his ax? Li\u2019s prudent comments are exactly what economists and investors want to hear \u2014 that Beijing will start to prioritize reform to set the stage for healthier growth rather than sacrificing everything for growth. Yet how committed are they to that course? Some economists are forecasting growth rates well below the government\u2019s 7.5% target. How far will Li and his team allow growth to slip? Li left open the possibility that the government would jump in. \u201cThe acceptable lowest limit of GDP growth needs to ensure enough employment and that people\u2019s incomes are increasing,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the economy continues to slow over the course of 2014, Beijing may have to make a difficult choice \u2014 growth or reform \u2014 that will likely shape the direction of the economy for years to come. So, as usual, Li told people what they wanted to hear.

particularly Japan - over a series of maritime disputes, Mr Li asserted Beijing's \"unshakeable will\" in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.\n\n\"When neighbours interact with each other, it's only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,\" he said.\n\n\"But as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.\"", "769": "Allaying fears of a crisis in China as the Government\u2019s debt crossed a whopping $3.4 trillion, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang today also vowed to show zero-tolerance to corrupt officials and \u201censure corruption has nowhere to hide\u201d.\n\nChina has attached high attention on Government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the parliament session.\n\nCiting an official audit of Government debts last year, Li said the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning limit.\n\nAfter two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that Governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of \u00a520.7 trillion ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or \u00a51.63 trillion, since the end of 2012.\n\nChina\u2019s mounting Government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and China has started to take steps to address the issue.\n\nLi said while the level is within control, he cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.\n\nIn China, local Governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.\n\nThe fiscal funds they receive from the central Government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local Government financing vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe will keep the front open and block side doors,\u201d Li stressed at the media conference.\n\nLi also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.\n\nRegarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.\n\nHe said the Government would also continue with the nationwide crackdown on corruption.\n\n\u201cChina is a country under rule of law.

It involves militaries and civil authorities of multiple nations including Australia.\n\nMalaysia is in charge. But it's China that seems to be flexing its muscle.\n\nWhen China's president telephoned Malaysia's prime minister to convey a sense of urgency, a Chinese official in Kuala Lumpur was made available to the media to repeat the message.\n\n(China official speaking)\n\n\"China requests a unified channel on the Malaysian side to timely release authoritative information\" said the official.\n\nHe ended his remarks by reprimanding Malaysia.\"The urgent task now is to speed up the search\", he said.\n\nIn Beijing, the chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China had more public advice for Kuala Lumpur.\n\n(Chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China speaking)\n\n\"In my opinion the accident is a very sad thing\", he said, \"and I trust the Malaysian government will give the Chinese side an explanation\".\n\nIt could all be seen in the context of a legitimate expression of China's national interest. But China's a country on the up, ambitious to be a regional superpower.\n\nThe presumed location of the plane wreck lies around disputed territory in the South China Sea that Beijing claims.\n\nIt's probably no coincidence that in this crash, so much manpower and officialdom has been on such public display.\n\nBut the families of missing passengers in Beijing would expect nothing less.\n\nMARL COLVIN: Peter Lloyd.", "771": "Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signalled on Thursday that Beijing was willing to accept some debt defaults in the world's second-largest economy as it struggles to clean up its multi-trillion-dollar \"shadow banking\" sector.\n\nHis comments come after the country's first-ever default on a domestic corporate bond last week and as investors grow worried that other firms could follow suit.\n\nLi said authorities \"pay very high attention\" to financial and debt risks, as he held his once-a-year news conference after the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Communist Party-controlled legislature.\n\nHe could not possibly \"want to see\" defaults on financial products, he said at the Great Hall of the People.\n\n\"But I'm afraid sometimes certain individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable,\" he added.\n\nShanghai-based Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. said Friday it was unable to make bond interest payments of 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million), sending it into a landmark default.\n\nAnd on Tuesday power equipment maker Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co. said its bonds would be suspended from trading after it posted two consecutive years of losses.\n\nHowever, analysts said the Chaori default could benefit the market in the long term by raising awareness of risk and making investors more selective.\n\n\"Allowing Chaori to default on its bond was in fact an obvious sign that the government has started to make some adjustments (in policy),\" said Zhou Hao, Shanghai-based economist for ANZ Bank.\n\n\"Previously, it wanted to avoid defaults, but now it hopes to rely more on market-oriented measures to ease some risk,\" he told AFP.\n\nRatings agency Moody's said: \"We believe the default will spur needed development in the onshore bond market.\"\n\n\"The lack of intervention is consistent with the central Chinese government's adoption of more market-oriented policies, which include increased tolerance for corporate bond defaults, as it reforms the country's financial markets,\" it said.\n\nEarly this year, worries surfaced in China over other financial products issued by trust companies, which have drawn comparisons to American \"junk bonds\" of the 1980s.\n\nIn one case, a $160 million investment product structured by Jilin Province Trust and backed by a coal firm failed to make capital and interest payments.\n\nSeparately, a $500 million investment product structured by China Credit Trust avoided default in January after an unknown party made good on principal payments to hundreds of investors, though they did not received pledged interest.\n\nSuch products are part of a murky \"shadow banking\" system -- a vast network of lending outside formal channels and beyond the reach of regulators.

This is not going to be easy,\" Li acknowledged.\n\n\"We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions. This holds the secret of our success,\" he said, citing a Chinese proverb that \"only a sharpened axe can cut through firewood.\"\n\nAlthough China's 7.5 percent growth target is the same as previous years, its importance is fading as many believe the government will no longer view the figure as the necessary minimum as it usually did in the past.\n\nSenior leaders and officials have on various occasions backed up the macro-economic control strategy featuring the idea of \"a proper range,\" -- a lower limit to ensure steady growth and job creation and an upper limit to avert inflation, which was first proposed by Li in July.\n\nFinance minister Lou Jiwei joined the chorus last Thursday, calling for more comprehensive understanding on the country's growth target instead of merely fixating on the 7.5-percent figure.\n\nGDP growth, inflation and employment are all key factors that should be taken into consideration when assessing economic conditions, Lou told a press conference, adding that a growth of 7.3 percent or 7.2 percent can still be counted within that range.", "773": "BEIJING, March 13 -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said that his government will give a priority to the promotion of social fairness and the improvement of people's livelihood.\n\n\n\n\"We need to meet people's basic living needs, to provide the last resort for people to fall back on in case of special difficulty, and to promote social fairness,\" Li said at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session, calling them three major tasks for the government this year.\n\n\n\n\"Those topics related to people's livelihood presents priority on the government's work agenda,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLi said the government will endeavor to make China's medical insurance and basic old insurance schemes \"truly portable and transferrable\" to further expand their coverage in urban and rural areas.\n\n\n\nThe government is going to explore the possibility of raising the basic pension benefits at a proper time, he said.\n\n\n\nThe premier urged all the government employees to put the special needs of the people, such as those who run into special difficulty because of serious illnesses or sudden disasters, on the top of their mind.\n\n\n\n\"The government needs to take more effective measures to ensure equal opportunities in finding jobs and to level the playing field for people who want to start their own business,\" Li said.\n\n\n\nHe also said that the government needs to pay particular attention to education to ensure fairness at the very starting point.\n\n\n\n\"This year we have set the target of raising the proportion of rural students from poor areas enrolled in key universities and colleges by over 10 percent,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe premier also vowed to further improve the poorly built and low performing schools in China's poor areas.\n\n\n\n\"The government needs to create conditions to ensure that each and every individual has an equal shot at a better life through hard work and that fairness and justice are truly realized even at the most primary level of society,\" he said.", "774": "Beijing: Common interests between China and the United States far outweigh the countries' differences, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday, sounding a cordial note following a minor spat over President Barack Obama's recent meeting with the Dalai Lama.\n\nLi told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further \"unleash the potential\" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.\n\nHe cited a Chinese saying that \"wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences.\"\n\n\"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits,\" Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.\n\nLi did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist.

The scene was the annual press conference with China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People. Actually, the words \u201cpress conference\u201d make the session that closes the National People\u2019s Congress sound like a spontaneous event. Rest assured that the Q&A with the Chinese Premier is a meticulously scripted affair.\n\nThe journalists chosen to ask questions on the morning of March 13 were contacted beforehand. There\u2019s negotiation \u2014 at least from some foreign reporters \u2014 about exactly how the queries will be phrased. But there are to be no surprises at the triumphal end of China\u2019s annual legislative session. This pre-screening ensures that the Premier somehow has all the right facts and figures available to respond in great detail. There are even ringers brought in who are instructed to raise their hands with great enthusiasm. As Li slogged through his answers, journalists took bets on how long it would take for the news-making moment to arrive.\n\nLi uttered disquisitions on the mystery surrounding Malaysia Airline Flight 370, which disappeared without a trace on March 8 with 153 Chinese passengers on board (Li: \u201cfamilies and friends [of passengers] are burning with anxiety\u201d and \u201cas long as there is a glimmer of hope,\u201d China will not halt its search for the missing airliner) and the greatest challenge for China last year (Li: \u201cincreased downward pressure on China\u2019s economic growth\u201d). He vowed that \u201cwe need to loosen the straightjacket on businesses\u201d and mentioned the hot term \u201crule of law\u201d a couple times. Li acknowledged the severity of China\u2019s air pollution problem, guaranteeing \u201ca war on our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life\u201d and noting that the first thing many Chinese do upon waking is to check pollution-index aps on their cellphones.\n\nBut the question in question never came. For months now, a dragnet has appeared to tighten around Zhou Yongkang, who oversaw China\u2019s massive surveillance state until his retirement in late 2012. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li, China has launched an anti-corruption crackdown that has netted hundreds of wayward officials. President Xi has promised to nab both lowly \u201cflies\u201d and high-ranking \u201ctigers.\u201d If Zhou, he of the Mafioso slicked-back hair and steely gaze, is indeed probed, he would be the mightiest tiger to be felled in decades. After all, he was a member of China\u2019s elite ruling circle: the then nine (now seven) men of the party\u2019s Standing Committee who determine the course of the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nOver the past year, a slew of officials high and low who worked under Zhou in three main spheres \u2014 the state-owned oil industry, the populous province of Sichuan and the Public Security Ministry \u2014 have been detained. His son and top aides have been implicated in nefarious financial dealings. Zhou himself may be under house arrest. All of which led some China-watchers to expect that Premier Li would use a pre-approved question at his press conference to at least indirectly refer to the state\u2019s possible case against Zhou.\n\nLi did not. In an annual press conference remarkably devoid of actual news, the Premier did take on a question about corruption; it was the third one asked of him and was lobbed Li\u2019s way by a reporter from the online arm of People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece. Li\u2019s voice took on a stern tone as he swore \u201czero tolerance\u201d for corrupt cadres. He vowed that no matter \u201chow senior his position is [corrupt officials] will be severely dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d Li promised that \u201ceveryone is equal before the law.\u201d But, despite the People\u2019s Daily reporter asking specifically whether there was anything systemic that could be changed, Li declined to tout an easy tool to combat corruption among party ranks: asset disclosure. Granted, releasing such financial information is a rather touchy subject in a political culture where profiting from power is almost expected.\n\nMore importantly, no names \u2014 certainly not Zhou\u2019s \u2014 were named. Two years ago, at the final press conference by outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao, he launched a not-so-oblique attack on Bo Xilai, the former party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing and an aspirant to the Standing Committee. One day after Wen\u2019s press conference, the Bo purge began. It was a dramatic downfall that involved a poisoned British businessman, a murderous wife and a cache of absconded public funds. Bo\u2019s case turned into China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. (Zhou was considered to have been Bo\u2019s political patron.)\n\nAs the minutes ticked by in Li\u2019s presser, expectations rose. After all, former Premier Wen had dispatched his tirade aimed at Bo toward the end of his press conference. Before answering his penultimate question, Li noted that it was time for lunch. Journalists must be hungry. A question followed on China\u2019s trading relations with Europe \u2014 specifically to do with high-speed rails, nuclear power and solar panels. Then came the last question, the subject of which I\u2019ve frankly forgotten. Suffice it to say it was not about Mr. Zhou. Reporters were dismissed for lunch.\n\nOn Weibo, China\u2019s lively although occasionally censored microblogging service, people digested the press conference. One popular strain of commentary wondered why no mention had been made of Zhou. Wrote one Weibo user: \u201cI\u2019m very puzzled, why did the journalists, especially the foreign journalists, not cherish their opportunity to ask questions? Don\u2019t they know Master Kang is the most delicious one?\u201d (Zhou\u2019s name is blocked on Weibo searches so Chinese online use creative nicknames like Master Kang to evade the state censors.) Apparently the Weibo commenters were not aware of the scripted ritual. In fact, in a meeting with a senior Chinese official some weeks back, some of us in the foreign press community had already been warned that a question on Zhou was verboten.\n\nMeanwhile, the day before Li\u2019s press conference began, a bloodied man was found dead in the stairwell of a securities\u2019 firm off Beijing\u2019s Financial Street, one of the Chinese capital\u2019s business areas. Police said the man had ended his own life with a knife. His will was discovered. The dead man, according to Chinese media reports, is related to a former secretary to a senior leader currently under investigation. The Chinese press did not name the disgraced politician but he appears to be none other than Zhou Yongkang.\n\n\u2014with reporting by Gu Yongqiang/Beijing\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "776": "Data on retail sales and industrial production in China came in below forecast Thursday, MarketWatch reported, citing numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics, adding to mounting concerns that the world\u2019s second-largest economy might be facing an overall slowdown.\n\nGrowth in industrial production in China slowed to 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014, compared to a 9.7 percent expansion in December, and growth in retail sales narrowed to 11.8 percent from 13.1 percent in December, MarketWatch reported.

From high-tech products to cutting-edge scientific research and development, China's drive to shift its role from \"the factory floor of the world\" to an inventor and innovator has become a hot topic at home and abroad. Xinhua reporters carried out a series of interviews around the world to sketch out how the foreigners think of the the China-developed products and the related developments. DIALOGUE 1 Xinhua: Do you have anything developed and produced in China? How do you feel about them? \"I don't know it was made by China,\" said a Californian commuter Passti, referring to the BYD E-bus she is on. \"It's very comfortable, very clean and quiet, I love it ... It would be perfect if it has more space.\" The bus driver Derrick Smith also expressed his fondness for the bus. \"I actually like driving BYD's electric buses over any gas-fueled or CNG-fueled buses. They ride a lot smoother, cleaner; they feel a lot lighter, and the driver area is more comfortable,\" he said. Beside electronic busses, China-designed cellphones have also edged into the Western society. \"Of course I use the ZTE phones. I am proud to use it,\" said Nicklas Sivander, sales director of ZTE's Sweden office. \"It has all the features I need ... I also control my whole home music system with this smartphone. So it's my everyday tool.\" DIALOGUE 2 Xinhua: What are the competitive edges and weaknesses of Chinese manufactured products compared with their international competitors? \"The (Chinese) technology is very good,\" said Brenden Riley, sales chief of BYD's North American office. \"My only concern with Chinese new tech is that I don't find the design so pretty yet, but that will come with time.\" Chinese-made products \"need to be cooler, prettier,\" Riley noted. \"The life cycle of high-tech products is short, so the international competition requires a different way, more localized ... I think it's coming but just not there yet.\" However, to Sivander, the tempting quality and price of Chinese mobiles made them successful in local market. \"We have all the features that any advanced smartphone has on the market right now,\" he said, \"The good thing with this phone is we can offer it with attractive price here in north Europe, which means that we are competing with the major player but giving more value for money.\" \"What we need to improve our performance here is to work on our brand, to inform the consumers that ZTE exists and has designed proper products,\" Sivander suggested. DIALOGUE 3 Xinhua: How is Chinese scientific groups' papers publication doing, in terms of originality, forwardness and growing rate? According to data provided by Natasha D. Pinol, senior communications officer of science, almost 70 published original research papers have listed authors from China in 2010. But to 2013, the number has rocketed to 104. Dr. Nick Campbell, executive editor of Nature, also said increasing research papers from China have been published in his journals in recent years. \"From 2008 to 2012 we saw the contribution from Chinese authors to papers in Nature rapidly increase to 2.5 percent in 2012 compared to 1.5 percent in 2008,\" he said. \"Over the same period China' share of papers in all Nature journals were more than doubled, from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent.\" The editor told Xinhua that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has replaced the University of Tokyo in January 2013 as the largest institutional contributor to Nature in the Asia-Pacific. \"All indications at this stage are that this pattern of growth has continued,\" said Campbell. \"Our criteria for selection focus on original findings of outstanding significance that are of interest to an interdisciplinary readership... in broad terms, an improvement in the number of Chinese researchers that are meeting these exacting standards in their papers.\" DIALOGUE 4 Xinhua: China has made considerate investment in scientific R&D. Can you tell us how is China's research output compared with that of the West? What should be underlined in China's reform of its scientific and research system in your opinion? \"Government support for science clearly helps to speed scientific advancement,\" said Pinol. \"Adequate federal support for research and development is essential to innovation. China's leaders clearly recognize the connection between increased government support for science and the discoveries that drive economic prosperity.\" As for Campbell, he said research-output efficiency is not a trivial thing to measure. \"We would never suggest that you should use publications in Nature journals,\" he said. \"Nonetheless we can at least look at how countries do relative to their total number of researchers. These figures show that China's contribution to these journals is lower than smaller Asia-Pacific countries such as Australia and Singapore, and the largest global contributors to Nature journals, the USA and UK.\" However, the executive editor argued that there is no perfect way of organizing a research funding system. \"Many nations are struggling to strike an appropriate balance bet,\" he said. \"Like all nations, China needs to continue to focus on improvements that reward high quality research outcomes and help leverage that research to ultimately make a substantive positive impact on broader society.\"", "789": "NEW YORK (MarketWatch) \u2014 U.S. stock futures got a boost on Thursday from a duo of reports, which showed a surprise drop in weekly jobless claims and a rise in retail sales in February.\n\nShares of Plug Power Inc. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. both jumped in premarket on earnings reports.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 index US:SPH4 rose 4.2 points to 1,871.90, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJH4 added 31 points to 16,370.

No one is commenting, but I hear the license fee is in the $4 million-$5 million range per episode (closer to $4 million), a high number for a comedy series. This marks Big Bang\u2018s second consecutive three-season pickup, a commitment reserved only for the biggest shows on television. While it is the biggest deal by far, Big Bang is not the only WBTV comedy in renewal talks with CBS. I hear the network and the studio also are in discussions on the other three Chuck Lorre series, with a 13-episode final season of Two And A Half Men eyed along with renewals for next season of Mike & Molly and freshman Mom.\n\nRelated: Warner Bros TV Readies Offers To \u2018Big Bang\u2019 Cast, In Talks With CBS For New 3-Year Deal\n\nWith the Big Bang license deal secured, WBTV and CBS will turn their attention to the cast. There had been some overtures but no real negotiations so far with original cast members Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar, whose contracts are up at the end of this season. (Big Bang\u2019s other regulars, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, closed new deals last fall.) Put on hold while license fee negotiations were going on, talks with Galecki, Parsons and Cuoco are expected to kick into gear soon. Currently at about $350,000 per episode, the three leads are projected to get to the Friends cast mark of $1 million an episode.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is head and shoulders above any non-sports series on broadcast TV and still posts year-to-year gains seven seasons into its run. Season to date, the comedy is averaging 19.79 million viewers in most current ratings ( up 4% from last season), and 6.1/19 in adults 18-49. The relatively quick and painless renewal after a couple of months of talks extends CBS and WBTV\u2019s good track record of largely smooth negotiations on high-profile, complex renewals like previous Two And A Half Men and Big Bang deals. \u201cComedy is a big part of our schedule, and The Big Bang Theory is the biggest comedy force on television,\u201d said CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler. \u201cThis multi-year deal further strengthens our network\u2019s position for future seasons and marks another chapter in the great partnership CBS enjoys with Warner Bros Television for delivering audiences the best in comedy. We\u2019re proud to work with and showcase the incredible talents of Chuck Lorre, Steve Molaro and this amazing cast every week.\u201d Lorre and Bill Prady created the series, which they executive produce with showrunner Molaro. Big Bang, which also is the highest-rated series in syndication, propelling TBS to No. 1 in adults 18-49, has garnered three Emmy Award nominations for best series and has won three Emmys for star Parsons.\n\nGiven Two And A Half Men\u2018s longevity and its importance, a final-season order reflects the desire by both sides to give the comedy a proper send-off. The series, now in in its 11th season, still delivers healthy ratings and has perked up in its new Thursday 9 PM slot. Last week, it drew a 2.5 in 18-49 and 10 million viewers, the show\u2019s largest audience and highest 18-49 rating since the season premiere. Mike & Molly and Mom are part of CBS\u2019 Monday lineup, which has been on the soft side this year. Still, they have stayed mostly at and above a 2 demo rating in Live+Same Day, most recently logging a 2.2 (Mike & Molly) and 2.0 (Mom). Plus, both have a bona fide star as a lead, Melissa McCarthy and Anna Faris, respectively.\n\nThe blockbuster status of Big Bang is expected to have a halo effect on the other Lorre series\u2019 renewals between CBS and WBTV, where the prolific writer-producer is based. It does make sense for a studio to leverage a hot property in negotiations with a network. Last May, Sony TV was able to secure a four-series pickup deal with NBC on the strength of new drama The Blacklist, which helped get series orders for two other Sony pilots, Welcome To The Family and Night Shift, as well as a renewal for Community.", "803": "Fans of The Big Bang Theory rejoice!

Verification for celebrities on social networks is nothing new, as Twitter has been plopping green checkmarks on the accounts of high-profile people who verify their identity for quite some time.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Tinder is a dating and networking app that allows users to swipe through potential matches, swiping right if they're interested in getting to know the person better, or swiping left to move onto the next one. The app pulls information and images from Facebook and uses them to conjure up suggested matches, basing who you see on things like your proximity to one another or mutual friends the two of you share. The app has blown up in a pretty big way too, boasting up to 10 million matches per day.\n\nIt's a neat idea, if we're being honest, but celebrities who use the app - such as Ashton Kutcher and Lindsay Lohan - find that they don't get very many matches because users who encounter them during their swiping frenzies assume the profiles are fake. According to Rad, celebrities will soon be able to enter Tinder in a different way, but he didn't get too specific about the verification process. Then again, we suppose a very small percentage of us need to know the ins and outs of the process, so in this case, it's at least somewhat acceptable that Rad is holding back most of the details.\n\nOnce the verification process is in place, doesn't that mean the celebrities who use Tinder will suddenly be flooded with an endless amount of new matches and chat requests? Not necessarily, as Tinder requires both users to swipe to the right before one can contact the other.

Rad says celebrities (who, remember, need love too) oftentimes get rejected by others on the app because people think the person on the other side is using a fake account. Also, since Tinder is accessed through Facebook profiles and stars sometimes use pseudonyms for those accounts, this verification process will have them side-step that issue.

Those shirtless pictures need to be put to better use.There's probably not many people out there on Tinder who have abs up to his standards.She's a hot model mom of four. There's no time for regular dating, so this would be a quick and easy way to meet men.

Tinder CEO Sean Rad explained to The Hollywood Reporter that when famous people are on Tinder, prospective hook-ups take one look at their photos and assume the profiles are fake (obviously). Also, since a Facebook account is a requirement for joining the app, the new verification program will allow said high-profile Tinder users to modify their Facebook names, since many celebs with Facebook profiles use fake names for the sake of privacy.\n\nSo what does this mean for us?

Yeezy actually joined Ross on The Arsenio Hall Show last week to perform \u201cSanctified.\u201d All told, this has been a decent year for Rozay so far, considering in 2013 he was shot at, sued for a bunch of things, dissed by a South African billionaire, and dropped by one of his biggest commercial backers after tripping over his flapping gums.\n\n2 to 5: Another artist who seems to have his very own gravitational pull debuts at No. 2. It\u2019s Pharrell, of course, whose G I R L (112K) is exactly as infectious as you would\u2019ve thought, and at least twice as daring. What do you get for the man who has it all, aside from a new hat? Well, a No. 1 album would\u2019ve been nice, or an Oscar, but the Neptunes dude will have to settle for perpetual bridesmaid status. We hope he\u2019s \u201cHappy\u201d there. Speaking of the Academy Awards, Disney\u2019s Frozen soundtrack stays strong at No. 3 with 100K sold. That gives the November release 994K this year alone. Next week, it will undoubtedly become the first album to sell a million in 2014. No. 4 goes to Glee star Lea Michele with Louder (60K), and No. 5 to country\u2019s Eli Young Band with 10,000 Towns (36K).\n\nThe Rest: We\u2019re tickled pink to see Beck\u2019s Morning Phase stay in the top 10 on its second week. That stark and lovely set dipped 62 percent in sales but still moved 33K \u2014 enough for No. 6. Lorde-mania continues, as the New Zealander who\u2019s been covered by everyone from CHVRCHES to Nirvana\u2019s Krist Novoselic sells another 31K packets of Pure Heroine to land at No. 7. SPIN favorite ScHoolboy Q dips from No. 1 down to No. 8, with Oxymoron moving 30K. SPIN cover star Eric Church and The Outsiders slips two rungs to No. 9 (30K-ish). And after an eight-year absence, R&B\u2019s Ashanti hits No. 10 with BraveHeart, released on the New York singer-songwriter\u2019s very own label, Written Entertainment. No William Wallace cameos, but a familiar face does appear: Ross himself, on \u201cI Got It.\u201d\n\nHot 100: Well, duh, it\u2019s \u201cHappy.\u201d Pharrell may not have nabbed the No. 1 album position, but his Despicable Me 2 song maintains its vise grip on the top spot in the Hot 100 songs chart. That\u2019s three weeks running now, as Idina Menzel\u2019s Frozen jam \u201cLet It Go\u201d scores a No. 9 slot. Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cDark Horse\u201d holds at No. 2, and Jason Derulo\u2019s \u201cTalk Dirty\u201d is pushed out of No. 3 by John Legend\u2019s far less lascivious \u201cAll of Me.\u201d", "842": "SHARE\n\nRick Ross\n\nMastermind\n\nMaybach Music Group/Def Jam Recordings\n\nRick Ross has called his long-delayed sixth studio album \"Mastermind,\" but the only person who would ever consider the rapper a mastermind is Ross himself. His presence on his own material and as a guest artist instantly gives a track a gangsta grit, but his recent rhymes and vocal delivery have been dull, as if Ross had written the verses 30 seconds before stepping into the studio. There was very little thought put into the controversial lyrics (\"Trayvon Martin, I'm never missing my target\") on the \"Mastermind\" track \"Black and White.\" Ross later tried to clarify that he didn't want the world to forget his name.\n\n\"Mastermind\" itself isn't likely to make that happen. Despite the guest appearances of far better rappers such as Kanye West and Jay Z, \"Mastermind\" is a forgettable ode to thug life and the Benjamins: \"Drug Dealers Dream\" begins with an automated voice revealing the $92 million plus in Ross' bank account. Even a scary and interesting real-life event \u2014 Ross was the target of a drive-by shooting last year \u2014 is boiled down to boring, bad-ass posturing on \"Nobody.\"\n\n\u2014 Piet Levy, plevy@journalsentinel.com\n\nSara Evans\n\nSlow Me Down\n\nRCA Nashville\n\nWhen Sara Evans returned to the studio to make 2011's chart-topping \"Stronger,\" the country singer was coming off a six-year recording break filled with trials and tribulations in her personal life. That album was a triumphant return for a powerful country voice.\n\n\"Slow Me Down,\" Evans' seventh studio disc, is a mostly joyful affair that finds the singer even more confident as she explores the many sides of love.\n\nOn other tracks, such as the powerful faith anthem, \"Revival,\" and the catchy \"Sweet Spot,\" Evans is downright giddy. But she saves the best for \"Better Off.\" Tapping Vince Gill for harmony vocals on a traditional country tune, Evans' weaves a warm tale about moving on from heartache. She's been there and has come out singing better than ever on the other side.\n\nListen to the album on Spotify.\n\n\u2014 Erik Ernst, Special to the Journal Sentinel\n\nAmerican Authors\n\nOh, What a Life\n\nMercury Records\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to accuse indie-rock band American Authors of plagiarism on its full-length debut, \"Oh, What a Life,\" but the New York band has clearly studied up on recent successful bands. \"Home\" features some smooth, fun.-style group vocals (initially inspired by Queen). \"Best Day of My Life\" lifts the sweet, soda-commercial-ready sentiment of Imagine Dragons' \"On Top of the World,\" with a cheery mandolin riff reminiscent of another Imagine Dragons track, \"It's Time.\" And the bouncing garage-rock guitar and Zac Barnett's distorted indie rock croon on \"Hit It,\" a playful look back at a missed romantic rendezvous, is swiped from the Strokes.\n\nBut sometimes you're just not in the mood for a provocative, original novel; you just want a beach read that offers a fresh take on familiar formulas. That's what American Authors does here, rather well. \"Oh, What a Life\" is the alt-rock equivalent of an addictive page turner.\n\nAmerican Authors performs April 8 at Turner Hall Ballroom, 1040 N. 4th St.\n\n\u2014 Piet Levy\n\nDon Williams\n\nReflections\n\nSugarhill Records\n\nAs much fun as it can be to watch an artist stretch in new directions, there's also something rewarding in experiencing the comfortable consistency of Don Williams.\n\nOn \"Reflections,\" Williams adds his voice \u2014 still smooth and strong, warm and gentle at 74 \u2014 to 10 tracks from some of his favorite songwriters.\n\nThe result is a deceptively simple collection of traditional country sounds, a refreshing oasis within the genre's modern bombast. \"I Won't Give Up on You\" is a delicate ode to undying love.\n\nMickey Raphael's harmonica lilts across Townes Van Zandt's \"I'll Be Here in the Morning\" and a rich take on Merle Haggard's \"Sing Me Back Home.\"\n\nAcross it all, Williams brings the same heart, emotion and easygoing warmth that have been hallmarks of his four-decade career.\n\nDon Williams performs April 2 at the Riverside Theater, 116 W. Wisconsin Ave.\n\nListen to the album on Spotify.\n\n\u2014 Erik Ernst\n\nElbow\n\nThe Take Off and Landing of Everything\n\nConcord/Fiction\n\nThe DVD of \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" might restore the original four-hour Scorsese cut that was whittled to three hours for theatrical release. Film fanatics are welcome to debate whether this is too much of a good thing or too much of a bad thing \u2014 but not whether it's too much for one sitting.\n\nQuality and quantity are relevant considerations during a session with Elbow's sixth album, which takes 58 minutes to get through 10 songs. The Manchester group eases into melodies and walks through them like Coldplay without the ultra-modern brightness and nimble pacing; it doesn't meander, but it doesn't hurry either.\n\nPeriodically, Elbow encounters and incorporates vivid color \u2014 the detonation of horns in \"Fly Boy Blue/Lunette,\" the street-view wonder in \"New York Morning\" \u2014 to liven up its blue, red and gray washes. However, the pastels persist and turn this LP into songs to be heard discretely rather than as a whole.\n\nListen to the album on Spotify.\n\n\u2014 Jon M. Gilbertson, Special to the Journal Sentinel\n\nThe Men\n\nTomorrow's Hits\n\nSacred Bones\n\nNew York punk band the Men continues to mature on \"Tomorrow's Hits,\" its fifth album in as many years. Opener \"Dark Waltz,\" with its barroom harmonica riff, dances to a country-rock beat, as frontman Nick Chiericozzi sings nostalgically about a boy getting his first guitar. \"Get What You Give\" goes for Petty and Springsteen-style heartland rock, and \"Another Night\" and \"Pearly Gates\" recall Rolling Stones' soul jams, complete with a stacked, swinging horn section that gleefully flies off the rails. Those songs in particular possess an anything-goes punk mentality, which shows that while the Men's ambitions have clearly grown, the band itself hasn't grown up too quickly.\n\nThe Men performs April 13 at Cactus Club, 2496 S. Wentworth Ave.\n\n\u2014 Piet Levy\n\nWake Owl\n\nThe Private World of Paradise\n\nVagrant Records\n\n\"I find myself so free,\" Wake Owl singer-songwriter Colyn Cameron sings on \"Madness of Others,\" off the folk band's debut album, \"The Private World of Paradise.\" It's a nice sentiment, set to a shuffling drum and warm, dreamy acoustic guitar. But within seconds of that phrase passing through Cameron's lips, a foreboding string section follows. That's not the sound of freedom, it's the sound of crippling dread.\n\nThat's what makes Wake Owl's debut so interesting. Musically, it's frequently very relaxed, '50s and early '60s pop reimagined for 21st-century hipsters. But through lyrics and unexpected musical passages, there's still a sense of emotional uncertainty floating through the album that keeps you wide awake and immersed.\n\nWake Owl performs April 18 at Turner Hall Ballroom.\n\n\u2014 Piet Levy\n\nJoan as Police Woman\n\nThe Classic\n\n([PIAS] America)\n\nThe neo-soul subgenre hasn't yet reached its cultural saturation point, which doesn't mean it hasn't spilled into other subgenres, such as the retro-soul material Sharon Jones does with such aplomb. Joan Wasser, the leading lady of Joan as Police Woman, follows another rivulet via \"The Classic.\"\n\nIt might be called postmodern soul: Wasser has worked within indie groups and as a hired player for Sheryl Crow and Rufus Wainwright, so she understands both the art and the mechanics of pop and here balances formalism and fun as cleverly as she ever has.\n\nSplicing street-corner doo-wop and street-corner hip-hop on the title track, subtly bestowing alleyway hipness on a torch song with \"New Year's Day\" or playing the slow funk almost totally straight on \"Stay,\" Wasser creates music that, depending on the listener's mood, repays close study or sexes up the air it fills.\n\nListen to the album on Spotify.\n\n\u2014 Jon M.

It's not a new experience for the bawse, who now has five no. 1 albums to his name. His newest release was on par with his previous releases in terms of first-week sales, moving 179,000 copies. Hip-hop debuts have dominated the charts the last two weeks, as ScHoolboy Q topped the chart last week.\n\nPharrell Williams' G I R L was the second new release to reach the charts this week, as it sold 112,000 copies. It's the biggest solo debut by far for the performer, but it's not surprising considering his singles success. His track \"Happy\" has spent three weeks atop both the Hot 100 and Digital Downloads chart with \"Happy.\"\n\nThe big debuts meant that the Frozen Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was outside of the top two for the first time in ten weeks.

You have a Notorious B.I.G. album ready to set the music world on fire, right? False! Ricky Rozay\u2019s \u201cMastermind\u201d is far from a \u201cReady to Die,\u201d faintly reminiscent of a time in rap when Coogi sweaters ruled and car phones made you that guy.\n\nLet us not get caught up with Biggie comparisons, though. Instead, let\u2019s hold the Teflon Don\u2019s latest LP up against his own body of work. 2012\u2019s \u201cGod Forgives, I Don\u2019t\u201d showed us a side of Rick Ross that promised a departure from the surface-level gangster conveyed in Rozay\u2019s first four albums and a progression into the actual psychology of the crime kingpin Ross paints himself as. However, while more introspective rhymes could have established Rozay as a lyricist capable of giving you something to digest, \u201cMastermind\u201d lurches back to his Big Meech-Larry Hoover persona, imploring you to roll the windows down and obnoxiously bump the tales of this studio gangsta.\n\nWith that said, \u201cMastermind\u201d is going to tickle the fancy of his entire following, who seem to have an insatiable desire for gaudy, Capone-esque entertainment. Mentions of his cutting-edge designer threads (Balmain) and uber-exclusive car game (Rolls Royce Wraith) have metamorphosed simultaneously with his net worth and legacy, while the assortment of referenced armory would impress the most conservative NRA member. It\u2019s a wonder that the album case isn\u2019t lined in gold.\n\nThe slew of features don\u2019t ease any of the album\u2019s bougie, gun-touting nature either. Kanye, Jay-Z, and Diddy all appear as concentrated versions of their most egotistical selves. Yeezy questions his savior for God\u2019s sake! The thing about it is, hopping on a song with Rick Ross demands high levels of Black grandiosity to match his illusoriness. If the Dade County Don\u2019s sixth LP had to have a thesis statement chosen to pinpoint its message, the \u201cDevil is a Lie\u201d hook would do so perfectly.\n\nReligion emerges as the biggest boss\u2019s newest mantra on the album. A multitude of mediocre ecclesiastical allusions imply he\u2019s been spending more than a few hours watching religious specials on the History Channel. \u201cFiends linin\u2019 up like we having communion. This my daily bread and you niggas consumers,\u201d a religious Rozay posits on \u201cWalkin\u2019 on Air,\u201d preceding a meaningless list of bible books and holy figures. Throughout the album, the holy references do nothing but rhyme and deceive the average listener into thinking the last four bars of a verse weren\u2019t wasted.\n\nOn top of missing the ministerial mark, Rozay fails to build on that Jay Z-like swagger he stumbled upon in GFID, meaning finding that perfect balance between crack music and songs in the key of life. The move away from the live instrumentation that made a performance with 1500 or Nothin\u2019 masterful further ruined Ross\u2019s chance to become one who spits the \u201creal,\u201d instead of a theatrical figure with superficial significance. Attempts to comprise a thematic project failed as skits and song titles do the album\u2019s title no justice. By reverting to his old style though, his \u201cMastermind\u201d shows by resorting back to the ignorance we love to love. Perhaps, Diddy pointed him in the right direction in that respect. And though that Biggie sample of \u201cYour Nobody\u201d was \u201cDead Wrong,\u201d the album is full of the hip-hop essence that established Bad Boy records almost 20 years ago.\n\nONLY RECOMMENDED IF: You are excited for an aural recital of a contemporary urban gangster Broadway play.", "850": "Rick Ross may have just dropped his new album Mastermind, and in preparation for landing at the No. 1 album spot in the US, he dropped a new music video for \"War Ready\" over the weekend with the help of Jeezy.\n\n\"War Ready\" take a pretty straightforward approach to the music video, with Rick Ross, Jeezy and Tracy T glaring at the camera like its their mortal enemy.

Young needed US$800,000 (RM2.56mil) to fund his April 15 project; at the time of this writing, Pono Music\u2019s Kickstarter had amassed nearly US$1.5mil (RM4.8mil). It still has 34 days to go.\n\n\u201cPono is about the music, it\u2019s about the people who make the music, and the way it sounds to us when we\u2019re in the studio making it,\u201d Young said in a 12-minute promo video. \u201cIt\u2019s about you hearing what we hear.\u201d\n\nThe Pono Music players\n\nIn the clip, Young refers to his new technology as a \u201cmusic ecosystem\u201d, and the Rockin\u2019 In The Free World singer utilises an underwater-to-surface ocean graphic to explain the differences between his player and the competition.\n\nMost people listen to MP3s, which compresses files to the point of what the rocker calls \u201cunderwater listening\u201d. Listening to CDs does not give as deep an underwater sound, Young says, but is still \u201cnot quite in air\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you make it to 192, you actually break through the surface and you\u2019re breathing air,\u201d Young says of his format. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a visceral release and you feel good, your body feels good.\u201d\n\nYoung was not the only music legend touting the sound quality in the promo. Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Kid Rock, Dave Grohl, T-Bone Burnett, Rick Rubin, Eddie Vedder, and many more also weighed in. The list \u2013 and clip \u2013 goes on for a while. \u2014 Reuters", "854": "\u2018I don\u2019t want to take music backward\u2019: Neil Young on the launch of PonoMusic [SXSW]\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take music back to the old days, I want to take it forward \u2014 to the future,\u201d says singer-songwriter Neil Young, dressed in his black hat and black leather jacket, pacing up and down the stage of the Austin Convention Centre\u2019s Hall D. On the day that the Interactive portion wrapped up and the Music part began, Young came to SXSW to launch a new music service, one he believes will benefit listeners to hear music the way artists and producers intend it to be heard.\n\n\u201cThis is the 21st Century. Why be stuck with inferior quality?\u201d he asked \u2013 and it\u2019s this rhetorical question that forms the reason behind Young\u2019s new high-definition portable music player and download service. It\u2019s called PonoMusic, and it\u2019s currently being sold on Kickstarter, as a way not only to gain funding for the idea, but to build a community of like-minded music-lovers; people who want more from their music experience; people who are tired of listening to music through little white buds.\n\nPono Music is a service that works together with a device that looks almost like a 3D iPod. It fits in your pocket, and rather than provide a listener with MP3 versions of songs, stores them as 192 kbs audio format. This, believes Young, is the key to the quality of the recording. The PonoPlayer is being sold online for $339. Within four hours of the Kickstarter campaign launching, it had already raised $800 000.\n\nWithout notes, and evidently passionate about the project, Young explained where the idea, which has taken two and half years to implement, came from. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of listening loud \u2014 I love to listen loud\u2026 I like to take whatever it is to the limit.\u201d He says the introduction of the MP3 meant this was no longer possible, and it had a negative impact on the music industry.\n\n\u201cEverything started to die. It was because of the MP3 and the cheapening of the quality to where it was practically unrecognisable,\u201d he said, adding that the idea of \u2018filler\u2019 tracks on albums became an excuse for people to be only interested in single tracks. \u201cThe album had no value \u2013 only the individual tracks had value. As a guy who\u2019d been making records for many years at that point, I was pissed off. I love every note on every song on every record: they\u2019re a family of songs that tell a story of how I was feeling.\u201d\n\nHe maintains the sound of MP3 was \u2018s***\u2019: \u201cWe were selling shit, but people were still buying it because they like music [but] they were buying Xeroxes of the Mona Lisa.\u201d The way Young sees it, music adapted to the constraints of MP3 and instead of being soulful, it became beat heavy. \u201cIt became smart, it became tricky. But for me, it was like \u2018woah, I don\u2019t want to do that!\u2019\u2026 I started thinking it might be a good idea to do something about it.\u201d\n\nYoung hopes music lovers all over the world will buy into and support his new service, which allows users to incorporate music they\u2019ve already collected in other formats onto the player. He\u2019s already got a slew of well-known artists, from Bruce Springsteen to Dave Grohl to Elton John and Norah Jones singing praises about the quality of sound offered on the service. But he says that even if PonoMusic doesn\u2019t take off, and make the kind of successful impact he\u2019s hoping for, at least the boat will have been rocked enough for others to take note, and push for something more from the music-listening \u2013 and appreciating \u2013 experience.", "855": "Name of rocker's company 'Pono\" means righteous and that's how he wants music to sound.\n\nNeil Young and Mike Snider (Photo: Elliot Roberts)\n\nAUSTIN -- That didn't take long. Neil Young's PonoMusic project blew past its goal, netting more than $2 million in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe famed singer-songwriter launched PonoMusic, his long-awaited high-resolution music initiative, Tuesday on Kickstarter and surpassed its initial goal of $800,000 before Young even took the stage at South By Southwest to make his official pitch. It's already one of the most successful Kickstarter projects ever.\n\nHe and Pono CEO John Hamm plan to use the crowd-funding site to build consumer support for the PonoMusic ecosystem, which will offer studio master-quality music in an online store. The first product is a $399 PonoPlayer that can store up to 2,000 digital albums.\n\nThe players and software can handle most digital files, but it's when high-res files are used that the true sound evolution comes through.\n\nI got to test-drive a player earlier today and listened to the PonoMusic version -- and iTunes version -- of two songs I'm very familiar with -- Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits and Take Five by Dave Brubeck.\n\nThe difference when you listen to PonoMusic's higher resolution version is startling. A rich clarity brings the music to life.\n\nI'm no stranger to high-res music. I own Super Audio CDs and DVD Audio discs and an Oppo disc player that handles high-res downloads on a USB.\n\nBetter quality music shouldn't be such a hard sell. Back when the MP3 came along, its small compressed size was a worthwhile compromise for the ability to download and store lots of songs.\n\nNow that many of us have smart phones with 64 Gigabytes of storage on board those tiny, compressed files don't need to be the norm. But we have kept that format, or something close to it, while buying high-definition TVs that deliver ever-increasing video quality.\n\nI'm hoping that Young's right in his bet on Kickstarter driving a viral effect among listeners. There's already \"an artists' revolution\" underway, he says. Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Elton John, Patti Smith, Mumford & Sons and Eddie Vedder are just a few of the artists standing behind Young.\n\nIn a sense, Young may already have won. Just advancing the discussion about music quality is a triumph. \"If some big huge company comes along and kicks our a*s with millions and millions of dollars that is great for music,\" he said when I interviewed him on stage at SXSW Tuesday. \"That is what matters.\"\n\nAnd that is why I joined him and made my own pledge for a player on Kickstarter.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1iCt9sV", "856": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 Neil Young loves quality sound and he\u2019s willing to pay for it.

It was an auspicious start for a somewhat quixotic effort the singer has mostly funded himself so far. After initially targeting audiophiles who remember warm sound, Young hopes to eventually draw younger listeners as he tries to right what he considers wrong decisions made over the years when production moved from analog to digital.\n\n\u201cLife has been good to me, but this has drained me right to the nub,\u201d Young said with a smile. \u201cSo it\u2019s really good to see this happen because now all my guys are going to get paid. That\u2019s my happiest moment. Now we can keep going.\u201d\n\nThe 68-year-old rock \u2018n\u2019 roll pioneer gave a keynote address Tuesday during South By Southwest. Then he and PonoMusic CEO John Hamm met with reporters Wednesday, explaining why quality sound is important in the age of convenience and the MP3.\n\nThey\u2019ve created a standalone multi-format player for the service, which won\u2019t work on cellphones, and have made high-end digital masters of more than 2,000 albums available for purchase in an online store. The player, triangularly shaped like a Toblerone bar, will retail for $399.\n\nHamm said the service is aimed at people who remember what quality sound was like before compression and other changes meant for ease of use erased the depth listeners could hear on vinyl records. Hamm noted the popularity of turntables among hip 20-somethings and thinks they may too one day migrate to the Pono player.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really happy with this movement,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking how many people have been waiting for better music.\u201d\n\nYoung, who says he will release two albums this year and tour both as a solo act and with Crazy Horse, has been working on the service for years. He has previewed it for friends every chance he gets at events like the Grammy Awards. He\u2019s gotten not only celebrity endorsements, but now the support of the public.\n\n\u201cThe digital age was fraught with errors, errors of judgment,\u201d Young said. \u201cWhat can people hear?

It's called PonoMusic (the players are called PonoPlayers), and it costs $399 and contains 128GB of memory. Watch the Kickstarter video, below, featuring testimonials from Arcade Fire, Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, Beastie Boys' Mike D., Jack White, My Morning Jacket, Dave Grohl, Elvis Costello, and many more. As of this posting, the campaign had raised $340,000 of its $800,000 goal. (It runs through April 15.)\n\nDiscounted players are available for those who pledge $300 (the $200 offers are already gone) as well as other prizes. A $5,000 pledge will earn you an individual VIP dinner and listening party with Young in California; it's available for 30 people. Other prizes include Artist Signature Series PonoPlayers, featuring a laser engraved signature with the designated artists' favorite two albums. Young, Arcade Fire, Beck, Patti Smith, Willie Nelson, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, and more have Aritist Signature Series PonoPlayers available for a pledge of $400.\n\nIn the Kickstarter video, Young compares the experience of listening to MP3s to listening to music underwater. He makes the claim that the PonoPlayer allows for \"visceral\" listening, like breathing air. The Kickstarter page clarifies that Pono is not just a new audio file format. \"It is a grassroots movement to keep the heart of music beating,\" the Kickstarter reads. \"PonoMusic aims to preserve the feeling, spirit, and emotion that the artists put in their original studio recordings.\" Young refers to it as \"an artist-driven movement\" to save sound.\n\nThe triangular device connects to the PonoMusic App, for Mac or Windows, which offers access to the PonoMusic store, where you can buy and download music, much like iTunes. There are two output jacks, one designed for specifically for headphones and one designed for home audio systems or cars.\n\nIn his book Waging Heavy Peace, Young talked about the early days of Pono (when he called it \"PureTone\"), saying, \"An MP3 has about five percent of the data that can be found in a PureTone master file.\" More recently, he wrote, \"Hearing Pono for the first time is like that first blast of daylight when you leave a movie theatre on a sun-filled day.\"", "858": "Neil Young's been plenty busy recently. During his press circuit surrounding the Kickstarter launch of Pono, he talked to Billboard about a few forthcoming projects, including his forthcoming Third Man Records LP A Letter Home.\n\nThe album, \"likely\" due in the spring, will include two songs that feature Jack White. It features covers of songs by some of Young's favorite writers. Neil said of the album:\n\n\"It's not ready for prime time yet. It's not really a release yet, but it's a very unique record. It's like a time capsule. It doesn't sound like anything you've heard that was made recently. And some great songs, some beautiful music.\" \"They're songs that I love, songs that changed my life, songs that made it so that I understood what someone else was saying to me, songs by greater writers.\"\n\nHe also shared the name of his forthcoming memoir: Special Deluxe. He says it's a book that focuses on his love of cars:\n\n\"So it's a history through automobiles, and it's a history of automobiles and it's a history of the environmental impact of automobiles. And it's a projection into the future of automobiles. It has its own agenda that develops over the book.\n\nHe's been working on new music, and says one day, he'd like to do an album with a full orchestra, live, recorded mono with one mic:", "859": "Neil Young's online fundraising campaign for his new Pono music service and player reached its target amount in less than 10 hours.\n\nYoung launched an appeal on Kickstarter, the online crowdfunding platform, on Tuesday with the aim of raising $US800,000 ($A893,305.79) by April 15. He included testimonial messages from stars including Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty in an effort to convince fans to donate.\n\nThe target amount was reached less than 10 hours after the campaign went live, and Young and the PonoMusic team are now free to keep any surplus donations.\n\nAs of Wednesday, supporters of the new device had donated more than $US1.5 million.\n\nRewards for the most generous donors include a VIP dinner with Young and the chance to attend a listening party with the musician, as well as special editions of the PonoPlayer signed by its various celebrity supporters.\n\nYoung promises the Pono download service and personal music player will recreate the purest sound of music, presenting songs as they are first heard during the recording process.", "860": "PonoMusic\n\nWell, that didn't take long. Less than 24 hours after legendary rocker Neil Young launched a Kickstarter page for his long-talked-about Pono music service, the campaign surpassed its goal of $800,000.\n\nAs of this writing, the PonoMusic Kickstarter campaign has more than $2 million in pledges from more than 6,200 backers.\n\nOne of the reasons this Kickstarter campaign blew through the roof is that music fans and sound aficionados are eagerly looking to get their hands on the Pono music player, or PonoPlayer. The player has been in development for years and will use the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) audio format, along with other high-resolution music formats.\n\n\"I've been hearing Neil talk about this for years and wasn't convinced that it would ever really come to fruition, so it's great to see this,\" Kickstarter backer Matt Metzger wrote.\n\nAlong with the PonoPlayer, Young is also launching PonoMusic, which is an online store for high-resolution music.\n\n\"PonoMusic is an end-to-end ecosystem for music lovers to get access to and enjoy their favorite music exactly as the artist created it, at the recording resolution they chose in the studio,\" the Kickstarter description reads.\n\nYoung has talked about revolutionizing MP3 sound quality for years. In 2012, he announced the PonoPlayer and showed off a prototype of the device on the Late Show with David Letterman. While the PonoPlayer's release has been delayed over the years, Young said last fall that it would finally debut in 2014.\n\nThe PonoPlayer is slated to ship to Kickstarter backers in October; the US release is also expected that month and is said to retail for $399.", "861": "Most of the music you listen to is terrible, and not in the sense that it\u2019s devoid of artistry. It\u2019s terrible in that technically speaking, it\u2019s compressed in a \u201clossy\u201d format, although scientifically, you are completely unable to hear the difference. If you\u2019re one of those people who claim to be able to hear the difference, though, Neil Young finally has the MP3 player of your dreams up and running on Kickstarter.\n\n\n\nOK, so it doesn\u2019t actually play MP3s. The Pono is actually designed to play back FLAC files at 192 kHz. And yes, you have to buy them from the \u201cPono Music Store.\u201d\n\nTo give you an idea of how excessive that is, the general rule of thumb is with audio sampling is that you should sample at twice the range you actually produce. Human hearing tops out at about 20 kHz, and that\u2019s with people who don\u2019t have hearing problems. The idea is that this reproduces, exactly, how the music is played, even though most of it is stuff you can\u2019t hear and which, in fact, most audio equipment you can buy can\u2019t even reproduce. At those frequencies it generally stops being \u201caudio equipment\u201d and turns into \u201cscientific equipment.\u201d\n\nDid we mention that FLAC files, by their very nature, are fairly large compared to MP3s, meaning less music will fit onto this, something notably? Oh, and it costs $400. Just in case you thought there wasn\u2019t anything about this that wasn\u2019t tilting at windmills.\n\nTo be fair, Young knows his market. This comes with a stereo analog output so audiophiles can hook it up to their system and listen to digital music that way. $400 is nothing to the kind of person who spends $5000 on an amplifier.\n\nSo, basically, a cranky old Baby Boomer, years too late, gets to make his response to the iPod, just as the iPod is dying out. See, Kickstarter does make dreams come true.", "862": "Neil Young wants to start a revolution against the MP3, against the CD, poorly made vinyl and poor audio quality in general. He wants people to hear the music the way it was made.\n\nSo at SXSW yesterday (and on Kickstarter, which I'll get to in a moment), Young introduced Pono. In Hawaiian, the word means righteous or goodness. For the world of sound it's an audio player that Young says he's been working on for 2 1/2 years, one that's capable of playing music at the same quality at which it was recorded. (You can listen to his speech via the audio player on this page.)\n\nRight now, most portable players are capable of playing music at about the quality of a CD. In his talk at SXSW, Young pointed out again and again that when music is originally captured in studios, the quality of that recording can be better than a CD. Pono is built around the idea that whatever sound the musician records will be played back on the device without any manipulation. It's not format specific \u2014 MP3s will play on the Pono devices Young's team is selling, just as the superhigh-quality digital files he speaks so lovingly about.\n\nBelow, you can read some of the highlights of Young's speech, but the whole thing is worth listening to. At the end of the address, he played a video full of testimonials about Pono's sound by musicians including David Crosby, Sting, Jack White, Beck, Eddie Vedder, Arcade Fire, Gillian Welch, Norah Jones and dozens more. You can see that video here, too \u2014 it's the same one that's on Pono's Kickstarter page. That Kickstarter drive had an $800,000 goal when it launched last night. At last check, it already had more than $1.5 million pledged.\n\n\n\nNeil Young on Pono\n\nWhat he sees as the limits of digital music: \"I'm a fan of listening loud. I love to listen loud. That's what it's all about, really, for me. I love to hear rock 'n' roll really loud, and I love to hear even acoustic music really loud. Loud for whatever it is it's being played on. I like to take whatever it is to the limit, and then listen to it right there. When I started doing that with these machines, it started to hurt, and I couldn't do it for very long, so the part of the record-making experience that I used to enjoy became painful. That was a sign to me that something was wrong. I complained a little, and I might have bitched and moaned a little about that, too. Then time went by, and I got some better machines, but they weren't really that much better \u2014 it didn't change it. But I noticed when I listened to CDs in my car, the same thing happened \u2014 it hurt my ears a little bit. And then the MP3 came along, and that's when the recording industry really went into duress.\"\n\nWhy he thinks high-quality reproductions are important: \"Whatever you believe about where things come from, the human body is unbelievable. It's so sensitive. And when you give it something, it loves it. You give it good food, it grows. It's nourished. And when you give it good input, it loves it. When it sees great art, it feels good. We all are like that. So with our music, we were deprived. And we started getting very little, a minuscule 1/20th of what we [are] capable of getting, what we used to listen to. So then one or two listenings, you'd heard it. Your body was not getting anything new after that. You've already figured it out. That's it. OK, I recognize it. And music even changed a little bit. ... Music adapted. It became beat-heavy and it became right for what the media was that was selling it. It became smart, it became clever, tricky.\"\n\nOne reason he was frustrated by the rise of the MP3: \"I love making records. That's what I do. I love every song on the record, I love every note on every song on every record. They meant something to me. They're a family of songs that were telling a story of how I was feeling. They weren't just filler. I'm not the only one who feels this way.\"\n\nHow Pono was conceived: \"You're all listening to a lot of MP3s. They're very convenient. So what we decided to do was come out with a new system that was not a format, had no rules, respected the arc, respected what the artist was trying to do and did everything that it could to give you what the artist gave, so that you get to feel not just what the artist intended you to feel, but actually what the artist did. And that is what Pono is. Pono plays back whatever the artist decided to do or the artist's producer decided to do.\"\n\nHow he hopes the audiophile world responds to Pono: \"All those big things that you had to give away or put in the garage, they can come back now. All those stereo stores that had to close because there's no reason for big speakers anymore because people listen to little things that look like lozenges? Because those are the new sound? How cool they could be? You can put it right on the kitchen table next to the toaster and it sounds exactly like an MP3. Now maybe those stores will start to open up again.\"\n\n", "863": "\u201cRescuing an art form is not something that\u2019s of a high priority for the investment community,\u201d Neil Young said to a crowd of music aficionados packed into his SXSW interview late Tuesday afternoon. The group wasn\u2019t there to learn about his career, but to hear about his crusade to save music.\n\nOn Tuesday, Young and the folks behind Pono, a new music system aimed at enhancing the sound quality of digital recordings, launched a Kickstarter campaign to secure final funding for the revolutionary product.\n\nYoung spoke of the impetus for creating the system, a need that stemmed from the decreasing quality of digitally formatted recordings. The problem, which started in the \u201880s with the CD, hit its lowest point, in his opinion, with the introduction of the MP3.\n\n\u201c[Consumers] were buying wallpaper, they were buying background sounds, they were buying Xeroxes of the Mona Lisa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the recording industry really went into duress,\u201d he said. These digital formats compressed \u2014 and essentially discarded \u2014 the breadth of studio recordings. \u201cThis vibrant, creative, kind of whole culture started to go away, and it was because of the MP3 and the cheapening of the quality [of music].\u201d\n\nNo longer could you turn to your favorite album, play it in analog and hear the layers of the recordings in their true forms. \u201cWe were selling shit,\u201d Young said. \u201c[Consumers] were buying wallpaper, they were buying background sounds, they were buying Xeroxes of the Mona Lisa.\u201d\n\nBut, as Young pointed out, you wouldn\u2019t be listening to an album anyway, because in the digital heyday, albums had no value \u2014 only individual tracks were worth purchasing. \u201cI love every note on every song on every record,\u201d Young lamented. \u201cThey meant something to me. They\u2019re a family of songs that are telling a story of how I was feeling.\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing decades of the degradation of music, Young stepped in with a product that could revolutionize how we experience the art form. \u201cWhat we decided to do was come out with a new system,\u201d he said. Pono, a handheld digital device that looks like a triangular iPod, plays back \u201cwhatever the artist decided to do\u201d at the time of the recording.\n\nSo, music that was recorded years ago at a higher resolution (Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect\u201d for instance), can now be played back with its original magnitude and depth, not at the dumbed-down digital level we\u2019re used to experiencing. It\u2019ll bring you the reality of what the musician did in the studio, Young said.\n\nThe system includes the player, as well as an iTunes-esque store where you can buy music, but the two are not mutually exclusive. Digital recordings already in your library can be imported and played back on the Pono at their original recording level. Pono can also plug into your stereo system, said Young, and \u201cmake it sound like God.\u201d\n\nIf the Kickstarter reaction is any indication, Young and his team are fighting the good fight.

Legendary musician Neil Young is wanting to change that, and his obvious target is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) with its iPod and iTunes dominance.\n\nNeil Young has raised more than $1 million in his Kickstarter campaign for Pono Music. He was seeking $800,000 and has received $1.76 million \u2013 with 33 days to go \u2013 as of Wednesday afternoon. Pono means \u201cRighteous\u201d in Hawaiian.\n\nKickstarter\u2019s Pono Music site simply says,\n\n\u201cWhat righteous means to our founder Neil Young is honoring the artist\u2019s intention, and the soul of music. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been on a quest, for a few years now, to revive the magic that has been squeezed out of digital music. In the process of making music more convenient \u2013 easier to download, and more portable \u2013 we have sacrificed the emotional impact that only higher quality music can deliver. However, the world has changed in the last 10 years \u2013 technology has solved some of the underlying problems that forced that tradeoff. You no longer have to choose between quality and convenience when listening to music \u2013 you can have both.\u201d\n\nNeil Young has been featuring his new player around the SXSW event, where Apple has been present as well. What the Pono Music company is aiming to do is to use the master recordings from musicians. Effectively, it is high-resolution music and the number of songs that can be held varies as follows:\n\nCD lossless quality recordings (44.1 kHz/16 bit): About 5000 tracks.\n\nHigh-resolution recordings (48 kHz/24 bit): About 3200 tracks.\n\nHigher-resolution recordings (96 kHz/24 bit): About 1600 tracks.\n\nUltra-high resolution recordings (192 kHz/24 bit): About 800 tracks.\n\nHigh-resolution digital albums for download at Ponomusic.com are expected to cost between $14.99 and $24.99, but the company says that there may be exceptions.\n\nReports have been out this week that Apple wants to sign up more and more exclusive deals with artists. iTunes gets close to 80% of all digital music sales now, so even with a market that has started to decline there are huge opportunities for niche players.\n\nCan Pono unseat iTunes? Our guess is that mainstream music listeners will go for the choice of the masses, particularly when it boils down to price. That doesn\u2019t mean that an established musician cannot carve out a niche for higher-end listeners who are willing to pay up for quality.", "866": "The annual spring bacchanal that is South By Southwest is underway down in Austin, playing host to hundreds of bands and creative types, including a boatload of Nashville artists and your intrepid Scene correspondents \u2014 more from them soon. Aside from some new Coldplay songs and Chance The Rapper getting shut down by the fuzz, the hottest news item so far is Neil Young's impassioned pitch for the new high-resolution music player and download/library service Pono. As Young explained, Pono's goal is to reinvigorate the market for high-quality audio by offering an equally convenient and better-sounding alternative to the MP3 and MP3 players \u2014 namely, a store that sells 24-bit digital downloads (among other formats) and a triangular player with 128 GB of flash memory and high-end audio components, retailing at $399.\n\nYoung presented his case on Tuesday afternoon, coinciding with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to fund the project. The goal of said campaign was to raise $800,000 by April 15; when I checked a few minutes ago, the pledge tally approached $1.7 million.\n\nClearly, there's an interest in improving access to high-resolution audio that extends further than the celebrity endorsers who appear in the Kickstarter video (including Third Man Records' Jack White, who recently worked with Young on his forthcoming A Letter Home, though reportedly in the role of low-tech ambassador, rather than duet partner). Audio fidelity was a prime concern for Band of Horses on their recent Acoustic At The Ryman album. There's plenty of room for debate, even in the analog realm: On my recent visit to Welcome to 1979, I learned that they got into the vinyl cutting business because of poor-sounding vinyl masters.\n\nAnyway, this is far from the first time someone's come up with a media delivery system that surpassed the quality available on the most popular formats. Do you remember CODE, the 24-bit-audio-on-DVD system devised by honorary Nashvillian T Bone Burnett? Or, does anyone (besides me) have a DVD-Audio or SACD player? In the video realm, maybe you remember HD-DVD, or (you don't have to date yourself) Betamax. These things don't always work out according to plan, and there are a few holes in the Pono concept. For one, it's still a portable device that most folks will probably listen to on earbuds. Also, people still pirate MP3s, even with their competitive pricing, and Pono's projected pricing is in the CD retail range, $14.99 to $24.99. And what about the power drain caused by working with high-res files? Said the Scene's Adam Gold: \"Long may it run; its battery, at least.\" Handling that partly explains the device's Toblerone shape.\n\nSo, my fellow audio enthusiasts, are Young and company on the right track with Pono? Is high-res digital audio a losing battle, being fought mostly with cool points? Is all-analog the best way to go? The Pono-curious (New Ponographers?) will have to wait until October to give their feedback on the device and service, but you can sound off in the comments section right now.", "867": "The PonoMusic player (photo credit: Ponomusic.com)\n\nNeil Young has launched a brand-new music product that may revolutionize the way we listen to digital music.

Long Live Indie.", "868": "Singer/songwriter/guitarist Neil Young\u2019s dream of a higher quality consumer music service appears to be slowly getting closer, as evidenced by the latest announcements at the annual South by Southwest conference and its accompanying Kickstarter campaign. Pono Music, in which Young is heavily invested, is a high-quality audio ecosystem consisting of a download service supplying digital audio files transferred from the original high-resolution audio masters, and a dedicated player with the ability to play back those files with equal resolution. Along with Apple \u2019s best kept secret in their Mastered for iTunes program, Pono is an attempt to raise the bar in audio quality, a bar that has been continually lowered since just before the turn of the century thanks to the public\u2019s acceptance of the quality impaired MP3 format, the beginnings of which can be traced by as far as the introduction of the CD.\n\nThrough the years, Young has always been a notorious stickler for audio quality, being one of the first artists to build his own personal studio based around hand-picked vintage audio gear, then later investing in Pacific Microsonics, which developed the HDCD audio technology that was acquired by Microsoft in 2000. He\u2019s also been a big proponent of hi-res audio formats like DVD-Audio and most recently Blu-Ray.\n\nWhen I first heard of Pono three years ago I was initially skeptical. Large digital files like the ones required for the hi-res audio backbone of Pono weren\u2019t easy to deliver, and the public seemed just fine with the lower quality offered by MP3 and streaming services. Even last year, when Pono\u2019s introduction was teased, success still seemed somewhat far-fetched with the wholesale movement towards the convenience of streaming music, one that continues in earnest at the moment.\n\nToday is a different day, however, and now I look at the Pono player/service in a somewhat different light. First of all let\u2019s look at what Young and his cohorts have done right.\n\nThey made their license deals with the major labels way in advance of the service introduction, unlike many other streaming and download services. This probably wasn\u2019t too difficult in that the Pono downloads will go for a premium, and normal music downloads have already peaked, so the labels looked at this as somewhat of a replacement and weren't so much in a position to push a deal in their favor.\n\nSecond of all, the timing is right. Vinyl record sales are on an upsurge and the majority of buyers are in the 18 to 25 year old range. They\u2019re being exposed to high-quality music production for the first time via vinyl, and will be prime candidates for a more portable version of the experience. Pono is the perfect fit.\n\nPono only needs a small segment of the market. Whenever a new format is introduced, its creators and investors many times foolishly eye the entire market for adoption. The fact of the matter is that according to an article written in Billboard Magazine by music industry mover and shaker Tommy Silverman in 2007, only 10 to 15% is required to make a new format succeed and become another significant revenue stream for the industry. Just on a general feel for the business, I\u2019d say that 10% may be the upper limit of potential market penetration, but that\u2019s still enough for Pono, the record labels, the artists and songwriters all to feel good about it.\n\nPono Music\u2019s Kickstarter campaign is actually brilliant. It\u2019s not so much about raising cash for operations or marketing as it is about pre-orders and social buzz. When I last checked, there were well over 2,000 playback units that had been ordered that resulted in raising over $900,000, outdistancing its goal of $800k with 34 days left to go in the campaign. This was keyed by offering a number of \u201cArtist Signature\u201d versions signed by artists like Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, Patti Smith, Pearl Jam and Crosby, Stills & Nash, among others. Like I said, brilliant.\n\nAnother thing that Pono did right was ceding the audio electronics design to the highly-regarded Ayre Acoustics. This ensures that the audio output of the playback devices matches the resolution required to maximize the experience presented by the high-resolution audio files.\n\nBut speaking of audio quality, here\u2019s what the company missed. It doesn\u2019t supply a set of comparable quality headphones or earbuds with the device. Although the company claims that you can hear the difference on anything you might have lying around, why take the chance? If I were Pono I\u2019d be doing a deal to include a high-quality collapsible pair of headphones from a company like AKG, Sennheiser or Audio-Technica for inclusion with the purchase, or at least have it as a readily available accessory.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen in the past what such a seemingly small addition like an earpiece can do to the acceptance of a device. If you go back to the 1960s when the first portable transistor radios were introduced, what really put that device over the top was the fact that you could listen to it anywhere and in any situation (many of us kids of time can remember pretending to be asleep in your bed while listening discretely to the radio hidden under the pillow and the earbud in your pillow ear). The same thing happened with the iPod and iPhone, as the earpiece was made to sound better out of the box, and it was so distinctive that everyone knew what brand you were listening to.\n\nBeing an audio and tech guy myself, I applaud Neil Young and the Pono team for their efforts. It\u2019s indeed a noble cause to keep high-quality audio alive. There\u2019s no doubt that when people are exposed to it, they can be quickly converted with the right demonstration. I do hope that the company keeps its expectations in the proper perspective, and remembers how valuable a simple earpiece can be.", "869": "Saying that he wants to \"bring back real music,\" rocker Neil Young unveiled the PonoPlayer yesterday. Young put his high-end digital music player on Kickstarter with a relatively lofty goal of $800,000. One day later, his new device has doubled that goal, rocketing past $1.6 million.\n\nThe device is aptly described on Pono's page as a \"Toblerone shape,\" looking about as long as an adult hand and reportedly weighing 4.5 ounces. It's packed with 64GB of on-board memory, along with a 64GB SD card. A small touchscreen, three physical buttons, and two 3.5 mm audio-out jacks round out the rest of the device. With no on-board speakers, video capability, or even pocket friendliness, this $300 device plants its feet firmly in its mission: to deliver higher-bitrate audio to the masses.\n\nThe campaign includes an 11-minute video of Young-era musicians like Patti Smith, Tom Petty, and David Crosby asserting how much \"better\" music can sound on a PonoPlayer. But the technical detail is mostly lacking from those musicians, as they merely assert that the device better replicates the sound heard in a music studio. In the clip, Young himself eventually talks about how much better music can sound at higher bitrates\u2014not just CD quality, but 192kHz/24-bit. The FAQ section includes technical explanations about \"zero-feedback circuitry\" and hints about the device's digital filter and DAC chip.\n\nWhat won't be music to Young's ears is the growing crowd of audiophiles who aren't convinced that higher bitrates alone do the trick. In particular, the xiph.org community, longtime backers of the FLAC file format, released an anti-Young salvo decrying the use of 192kHz audio as foolish at best and harmful to the source audio at worst. And while Pono asserts that music will sound better on any headphones or earbuds, the biggest benefits of PonoPlayer's high-res files will be lost on anyone whose cans don't have a nice handle on highs and lows alike.\n\nEither way, $1.6 million has fallen into the laps of Young and co. (It's worth noting that $150,000 of that came from 30 backers who bought into a private dinner with Young himself.) The total number thus far might get music executives salivating, but their real excitement probably comes from the dream of a successful Pono online music store, where full album sales of higher-bitrate albums, according to a video on the Kickstarter page, start as high as $18. Time will tell whether the PonoPlayer and its online store will attain their launch estimate of October of this year.", "870": "Just one day after its launch, Neil Young's Pono digital music player has soared past its $800,000 US crowdfunding goal and well on its way to production.\n\nA longtime critic of the highly compressed and less dynamic audio quality of most digital music, Young has been working with audio engineers for several years on a high-fidelity alternative that is as portable and convenient as an iPod or other .mp3 player.\n\nOn Tuesday, the San Francisco-based PonoMusic Team launched its $800,000 US fundraising campaign on the popular website Kickstarter.\n\nBy noon ET on Wednesday, pledges surpassed $1.5 million US.\n\n\"Pono is about the music, it's about the people who make the music and the way it sounds to us when we're in the studio making it. It's about you hearing what we hear,\" according to Neil Young. (Canadian Press)\n\nMeanwhile the 68-year-old music legend pitched Pono \u2014 derived from a Hawaiian term denoting \"righteous,\" according to Young \u2014 in Austin, Texas, at the South by Southwest Festival Tuesday evening. He discussed the prism-shaped music player and its eventual music sales website before a packed audience at the Austin Convention Centre.\n\n\"Pono is about the music, it's about the people who make the music and the way it sounds to us when we're in the studio making it,\" Young says in a video on the Kickstarter site.\n\n\"It's about you hearing what we hear, and that hasn't happened in a long time.\"\n\nThe fledgling player \u2014 slated for an October 2014 release at an expected retail price of $399 US \u2014 uses the FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) audio format and can play other high-resolution music formats.\n\nThe device features a touchscreen, basic button navigation and two outputs: one for headphones/personal listening and another for plugging into a home or car audio system.\n\nThe eventual online store Ponomusic.com will charge between $14.99 to $24.99 US per album. Prices for individual songs weren't disclosed.\n\nYoung has already garnered a bevy of famous converts for Pono's apparently warm, vinyl-quality sound. Appearing in a video to praise the sound and/or the player are such luminaries as Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Jack White, Norah Jones, Charlie Musselwhite, Arcade Fire, Patti Smith and super producers Rick Rubin and T-Bone Burnett.\n\n\"Just so I can sleep at night \u2026 I want to bring back real music,\" Young says.\n\n\"I want everybody to hear music that way. That's why we're on Kickstarter, and we can share it with everyone.\"", "871": "Neil Young thinks that the music most of us listen to is junk, even his own.\n\nNo, it's not your secret Miley Cyrus playlist, it's the low quality of today's compressed audio formats that makes the musician cringe. \"Pono\" is Hawaiian for righteous and Young's goal with the ambitious project is to honor the artist's intention, and the soul of music.\n\nYoung's PonoMusic project launched on KickStarter yesterday and rocketed past its $800,000 goal in less than 24 hours. Backers are able to order the innovative player in either yellow (gold?) or black for $300, or chrome for $400, and the first run is expected to ship in October 2014.\n\nPonoMusic consists of two components: The PonoPlayer hardware which is shaped like a Toblerone chocolate bar and includes 64GB of internal memory and a microSD slot, and a companion music store that will sell high-resolution music that can be downloaded to the player.\n\nThe PonoMusic Store will offer tracks in FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) audio format although the PonoPlayer will play most popular high-resolution music formats from other sources and supports the following formats:\n\nCD lossless quality recordings: 1411 kbps (44.1 kHz/16 bit) FLAC files\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-resolution recordings: 2304 kbps (48 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher-resolution recordings: 4608 kbps (96 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra-high resolution recordings: 9216 kbps (192 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files\n\nYoung first introduced PonoMusic to the public in 2002 on Late Night with David Letterman (video), complaining that today's compressed CD and MP3 formats are \"dummied down.\" At the time, Young mentioned that he was working on a content deal with Sony Music and that he had Warner Brothers on board.\n\nYoung told Wired in September 2013 that he had the support of three major labels for the music service. But, sister site CNET speculates that customers will also be able to use other services like HDTracks. Other stores that sell lossless music include LiveDownloads.com and eClassical.com.\n\nApple is likely paying close attention to PonoMusic, but should it acquire the music startup?\n\nOne line of thinking is that Apple could eventually acquire, miniaturize and incorporate Pono technology into its own devices, but it would be a difficult task. The PonoPlayer is the size and shape that it is because it allowed engineers to use larger audio components and to separate them far enough apart to prevent electrical interference between the various subsystems. The shape also allowed engineers to use a more efficient cylindrical battery according to the Kickstarter project.\n\nAnother possibility is that Apple could market a dedicated Pono-like player to audiophiles as \"iPod Pro\" or \"iPod studio,\" perhaps under a licensing deal with Young. At a minimum, Apple should sell music in lossless formats, instead of just the lossy AAC format it offers today.\n\nApple's not ignoring lossless audio entirely though. It introduced the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) in 2004 and open-sourced it 2011. ALAC is similar to other lossless codecs (like FLAC and Shorten) and, although all current iPhones and iPads can play ALAC\u2013encoded files, they're not sold via iTunes and are thus limited to audiophiles encoding their own music.\n\nWhat do you think about PonoMusic and lossless audio in general?", "872": "Neil Young has been recording his music in the high-resolution music format that the PonoMusic store will sell for quite some time, according to what he told SXSW attendees last night. Many other artists and labels, however, have not been doing this, which will render Pono\u2019s catalog of high-resolution music fairly anemic relative to other digital music stores and services.\n\nSo, how does Pono expect to compete with Amazon and iTunes, not to mention the increasingly popular on-demand subscriptions services that offer tens of millions of songs for $10 per month? Who in their right mind would switch to Pono \u2014 especially when it costs $15-$25 per album and requires a special $400 player?\n\nNobody. And Pono itself has no delusions about that.\n\nInstead, Pono seems to view itself as a sort of portable record player. The same people who listen to and discover music on the streaming services and then buy high-resolution vinyl records of their favorites, Pono hopes, will buy PonoMusic files in order to be able to carry high-resolution versions of that music around with them, implied the company\u2019s CEO at yesterday\u2019s \u201cIs 2014 the Return of the Home Stereo?\u201d panel (more on that here).\n\n\u201cOur context really is that it\u201ds \u2018different horses for different courses,\u2019 and it\u2019s the context of how you listen to music that matters,\u201d said Pono CEO Jon Hamm. \u201cI\u2019m a Spotify user. I have a Sonos system. And I also obviously love Pono. It just really depends on what music you want, for when you\u2019re listening.\u201d\n\nAs such, Pono does not plan to be part of the music discovery process, and does not expect to be anyone\u2019s only music service. Instead, Hamm sees it as another option people might choose if any of their very favorite albums happen to be available there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let these guys take care of discovery and those kinds of things,\u201d said Hamm, gesturing towards Spotify director of platform marketing Tim Grimsditch, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our role in the industry. What our research says is that people love the music they love more than you would believe. Everyone probably has their desert island albums or songs even, that if forced to take a hundred songs, or ten albums with you for the rest of your life, you\u2019d know how to put that list together\u2026 I met a guy the other day who has seven copies of Cat Stevens\u2019 \u2018Tea For The Tillerman\u2019\u2026 We\u2019re going to try to fill out catalogs of artists that really have incredible catalog following \u2014 The Rolling Stones, Neil Young \u2014 you know the names, people with more than 15 or 20 significant albums.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether Pono will actually make music sound better. The company exceeded its $800K Kickstarter goal on the first day, indicating that at least some music fans have been willing to accept Pono\u2019s premise. According to both Hamm and Pono founder Neil Young, one must hear the device in order to appreciate it; once the first units are slated to ship in October, music fans will have a chance to hear it for themselves, and decide.\n\nPhoto: Eliot Van Buskirk", "873": "Neil Young wants to change your digital music listening experience, and now he has the money to do it.\n\nThe rock legend and founder of Pono Music (\u201cPono\u201d is Hawaiian for righteous) shattered his new music player\u2019s Kickstarter crowdfunding goal in all of one day.

Young is a notorious, even cantankerous audiophile: he didn't begin releasing his \"Archives\" series until he could do so on Blu-Ray, which allows for 24-bit audio, a higher resolution than the 16 bits a CD has -- quality reduced further in MP3s, which trim file data to produce the small files we download and stream. That's why YouTube videos generally sound bad, not that anyone can tell anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung's goal, and that of the musicians he'd aligned with, such as producer T Bone Burnett, who gave hi-fi digital audio his own attempt with his stalled CODE format a few years back, is to bring listeners the same sonic richness that artists hear in the studio. There are many factors that stand in the way of that beyond just file size: an appropriate mix and master of the music, engineering processes which often squeeze air and dynamics out of recordings in order to hit higher volumes, an issue known as the \"loudness war\" ; a format which retains the character of the master, arguably best achieved so far by vinyl; and a system, like a receiver and speaker set-up or high-quality headphones, which flatters the musical data. An iPod and its accompanying free earbuds and a 128kpbs MP3, for instance, represent multiple barriers to a recording sounding, well, musical.\n\nPono appears like an attempt to answer the portability problem, as well as removing some of the complications of audiophile equipment like preamps. The Pono system, as far as I can tell, works like this: a Pono web store will sell high-resolution files (so you'll have to buy everything again -- again) in the FLAC format, a \"lossless\" format capable of better-than-CD 24-bit sound that's long been used by concert bootlegs and audio obsessives. The Pono player, essentially a triangular iPod, will have a 64 to 128-gigabyte capacity in order to carry all these massive files, as well as a key advantage over Apple's portable players: iPods and iPhones can't play FLACs, though they can play the rival Apple Lossless format.\n\nPono's Kickstarter page says quality will vary depending on the masters available: some Pono files will cap at CD-quality audio because higher resolution files don't exist, though I imagine music previously upgraded for Super Audio CDs and other HD formats will make a quick transition. As always, you'll need great speakers or headphones to make the most of the additional file data, but Pono, with its promise of \"the best sounding audio components,\" seems to offer a miniaturized version of the multi-component systems that have previously characterized audiophile listening.\n\nI have yet to hear a Pono player in action, and real-world use, outside of the realm of ideally staged demonstrations, will be the defining test of its value. At $400 for the device and more for individual albums, the product seems destined for a niche audience -- a music industry move toward high fidelity and away from the convenient, cheap-sounding files that have long dominated digital music has to be a good thing, but then again, $400 sure buys a ton of records.\n\nAre you interested in hearing what Pono can do?\n\n-- David Greenwald", "876": "Neil Young's online fundraising campaign for his new Pono music service and player reached its target amount in less than 10 hours.\n\nYoung launched the Kickstarter.com appeal on Tuesday (11Mar14) with the aim of raising $800,000 (\u00a3500,000) by 15 April (14), and he included testimonial messages from stars including Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty in an effort to convince fans to donate.\n\nLess than 10 hours after the campaign went live the target amount had already been reached, and the Like A Hurricane hitmaker and the PonoMusic team are now free to keep any surplus donations.\n\nAs of Wednesday (12Mar14), supporters of the new device had donated more than $1.5 million (\u00a3928,719).\n\nRewards for the most generous donors include a Vip dinner with Young and the chance to attend a listening party with the musician, as well as special editions of the PonoPlayer signed by its various celebrity supporters.\n\nYoung promises the Pono download service and personal music player will recreate the purest sound of music, presenting songs as they are first heard during the recording process.", "877": "Hey, perfect timing.

According to the massive response of investors who poured nearly $1.5 million in funding into the new music player Pono since its Kickstarter campaign went live yesterday, some have a bit more faith in Neil Young's tech dreams than one would expect. Young officially introduced the Pono music player at SXSW yesterday, where he explained how the product would right the wrongs inflicted by the MP3 on the music industry.\"All of [that] started to die -- it was the most amazing thing -- this vibrant creative culture started to go away. And it was because of the MP3 and the cheapening of the quality to the point where it was practically unrecognizable,\" Young stated at the presentation ( via ). \"We were selling shit.

The money will be used to finalise the design and put it into production.\n\nThe $800,000 fundraising goal was smashed within a day as pledges of $1.4m poured in, with another 34 days yet to run on the campaign.\n\nEach PonoPlayer will download content from the PonoMusic.com Store via a PonoMusic App for Windows or Mac. Although the devices are expected to ship this summer, there is no launch date yet for the online store, but albums are expected to cost between $14.99 and $24.99.\n\nThe PonoMusic files - which are based on the FLAC format - can be recorded at data rates of up to 9216kbps, directly from the original studio tapes for each album. This stores up to 30 times more data than a typical MP3 file and is said to give far higher quality playback by artists such as Sting, Tom Petty, Jack White, Arcade Fire and Flea from the Red Hot Hilli Peppers, who all appear in a promotional video on the Kickstarter page.\n\nEach player will have 64GB of built-in memory and a removable 64GB microSD card and come with two outputs: the first is a normal headphone plug and the second is an analogue output designed for connecting to HiFi equipment.\n\nThere are just three physical buttons on the device and the bulk of the controls will be accessed via the touchscreen. The battery is expected to provide around eight hours of playback.\n\n\u201cPono is about the music, it\u2019s about the people who make the music, and the way it sounds to us when we\u2019re in the studio making it,\u201d Young explains in the Pono trailer. \u201cIt\u2019s about you hearing what we hear, and that hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\u201d\n\nPeople can back the project from as little as $5, for which they will be thanked by name on the project's website.", "880": "Less than 24 hours after launching on Kickstarter, Neil Young's hi-resolution audio player Pono blew past its initial funding goal of $800,000. At this writing, Pono is up to $1.3 million dollars in funding from nearly 4,000 music fans.\n\nBackers are able to support the project with anywhere from $5 to $5,000 or more, but to get your hands on an early PonoPlayer device you have to spend a minimum of $300.\n\nThe goal of Pono is to let you hear music as close to the original recorded resolution as possible, according to PonoMusic, the company behind the device. Pono will use FLAC as its standard file format, and the PonoMusic store will sell music files ranging from CD quality of 44.1kHz/16-bit to so-called high-resolution 192kHz/24-bit recordings.\n\nAlthough FLAC will be its commercial focus, the PonoPlayer will be able to spit out pretty much any format you throw at it including ALAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, and non-DRM'd AAC.\n\nNeil Young showing off the PonoPlayer to David Letterman in 2013.\n\nPono is promising some of the best digital playback you've ever heard. That's a pretty big claim to make, especially since there are some serious criticisms about the value of high-resolution audio to the listener.\n\nNevertheless, it sounds like a lot of care and attention went into the components that make up the PonoPlayer, which may really be the Pono's secret sauce.\n\nPonoMusic says the player's digital filter is designed to eliminate any digital pre-ringing that you can sometimes hear on low-quality MP3s. The player's digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip is said to be \"widely recognized in the audio and engineering community\" as one of the top DACs available today. The DAC is believed to be the ESS ES9018.\n\nPonoMusic partnered with Ayre Acoustics to create the device.\n\nWhen it becomes available for purchase, the Pono will be a triangular-shaped music device weighing about 0.28 pounds. It will have 64GB of internal storage and a microSD slot supporting up to another 64GB, for up to 128GB of total available storage (about 5,000 tracks at CD quality).\n\nThe PonoPlayer will have physical volume and power controls, and a touch display for scrolling through music.\n\nThe device will sell for $400 at retail and come with a 1-year warranty. Anyone interested in the Pono can fund the project until April 15.", "881": "Neil Young \u2013 yes, that Neil Young \u2013 has a $400 portable music player he would like to sell you. Called the PonoPlayer, it\u2019s essentially an MP3 player for the audiophile. But it doesn\u2019t use MP3 files at all. Instead, the PonoPlayer supports FLAC audio files that contain significantly more data than their MP3 counterparts, resulting in a dramatically higher quality sound than a traditional MP3 player.\n\nThe device debuted on Kickstarter yesterday and in less than 24 hours, surpassed its funding goal of $800,000. As of publication, 3,900 people had pledged money towards the device with only 400 not pre-ordering a device.\n\nClearly there is a pent-up demand for a high-fidelity iPod.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to offer the highest quality digital music available from all the major labels and build the world\u2019s best sounding, easy-to-use portable music player,\u201d PonoMusic CEO John Hamm said in a statement.\n\nMusic is served through the PonoPlayer\u2019s music store. The files are all lossless audio, therefore the file sizes are larger than the average iTunes download. The PonoPlayer sports 128GB of storage, which is good for about 100 albums.\n\nThe company brags that the odd shape \u2014 it looks like a Toblerone bar \u2014 allowed the engineers to opt for larger and higher quality components including a larger battery, bigger capacities and space them far enough apart to minimize interference. At this point in portable electronics, consumers have countless ways to consume music. Form factor is no longer the most important aspect.\n\nThe smartphone has largely consumed the MP3 player. Apple sold less than half as many iPods during the 2013 holiday quarter than in 2012 (6 million vs. 12.7 million units). Part of this could be the dramatic adoption of streaming music services, which require a data connection. The PonoPlayer is for a uniquely different listener, though.\n\nThe PonoPlayer will never outsell the iPod. It\u2019s not going to spawn an explosive rebirth of dedicated portable music players. But like the revival of the vinyl record, the PonoPlayer serves a growing niche of music listeners that want to hear and feel the nuances not available through MP3 musics.", "882": "AUSTIN, TEX.\u2014Neil Young might have come to South by Southwest flogging a product like everyone else, but at least he flogged it passionately. The 68-year-old expat-Canadian rock legend spoke before a packed event hall at the Austin Convention Centre on the cusp between the SXSW Interactive conference and the SXSW music festival on Tuesday evening ostensibly to plug the high-fidelity Pono music device he\u2019s been threatening us with for nearly three years now. It\u2019s now aimed for an October release with an expected retail of $399.\n\nCanadian rock titan Neil Young touts his upcoming iPod rival, Pono, with a heartfelt plea for music as its creators want it heard. ( Dustin Finkelstein / Getty Images for SXSW ) The Pono music player.\n\nReally, though, his speech was a heartfelt plea for a return to proper audio fidelity in an age where music has been squashed dynamically, chopped into bite-sized form and cheapened as a recorded commodity by the dominant MP3 format. I haven\u2019t heard a Pono player for myself yet. All we got a glimpse of Tuesday were some projected stock pictures of the gadget and a couple more that Young briefly waved from his pockets onstage \u2014 for the record, the Pono looks rather like a second-generation iPod Nano thickened out into a stand-up, triangular shape. However, if the thing does what Young says it does, it could be the portable digital player that audiophiles have been yearning for years.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nHe certainly managed to rally a list of rock royals that included Bruce Springsteen, Jack White, Dave Grohl, the Arcade Fire, Duane Eddy and many others to provide awed video testimony of the system\u2019s power in a reel that ran midway through his session. The proof will come, as they say, in the pudding, and if you\u2019d like to get your fingers in that pudding, there\u2019s a Kickstarter campaign that, by Wednesday morning, had already surpassed its $800,000 goal \u2014 in under 24 hours \u2014 by more than $500,000. For now, though, Young\u2019s quest to bring vinyl-quality sound to a generation of music consumers accustomed to listening to thin MP3 files through laptop speakers and earbuds \u201cthat look like lozenges,\u201d as he put it on Tuesday, seems heartfelt, even if he\u2019s got a tough battle ahead of him in unseating the iPod as the dominant portable music machine.\n\nTake our poll\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a success or it isn\u2019t a success, music wins,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s available. It\u2019s freedom of choice.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Pono delivers what it promises \u2014 which is to play back audio files at the studio-quality resolution the artist originally intended, up to an including a whopping 9,216 kilobits per second versus the iTunes/industry standard of 256 kbps \u2014 one could at least feel the ache in Young\u2019s voice when he talked about how kids being raised in the digital age aren\u2019t properly \u201cnourished\u201d by three-dimensional, immersive sound.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\u201cThey can identify the name of the song and they can learn the melody from listening to it, but inside their souls they\u2019re just not getting what we got because there\u2019s just nothing there for them. The human body is so sensitive . . . when it sees great art, it feels good. (So) with our music, we were deprived and we started getting very little, a minuscule 1/20th of what we listened to.\u201d In a roundabout way, Young conceded that the Pono and its accompanying, iTunes-esque delivery service might be strictly for the serious audiophile. But he touched a definite nerve with the SXSW crowd when he lamented that the rise of the MP3 and the one-off digital single had done irreparable damage to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2019s veneration of the album as a sacred form. \u201cI was pissed off about that because I loved making records,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a family of songs that were telling a story of how I was feeling. They weren\u2019t just \u2018filler.\u2019 \u201d With Pono, he promised, \u201cyou get to feel not just what the artist intended you to feel\u201d and \u2014 if the original recordings warrant it \u2014 it\u2019ll make your car or your headphones or your expensive home stereo \u201csound like God.\u201d\n\nRead more about:", "883": "We acknowledge that we had our doubts regarding the future of the Pono format when Neil Young unveiled the first PonoPlayer. We had no doubt that the music format would sound superior to existing digital formats, but we suggested on Monday that few people would be willing to shell out $399 for a new device (when they already have an iPod, regardless of quality), plus be willing to buy entire albums versus track-by-track as iTunes allows.\n\nYoung began taking preorders via Kickstarter on Tuesday, and it seems that there's certainly enough interested parties to at least get the company off the ground. The rate at which the devices sold suggest there's more than enough interest. Young and PonoMusic set a deadline at April 15 to raise the goal amount of $800,000, but they managed to get it all within 24 hours of its unveiling at SXSW.\n\nThe basic model was offered at a slight discount, but Young had a number of draws to attract customers, as if the promise of a superior audio experience wasn't enough. A number of the devices featured digital signatures from embers of Arcade Fire, The Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam. Young's signature was etched on 500 limited edition versions of the machine, which went for at least $400. Young got a number of his pals from the music industry to take part in a promotional video for the service: David Crosby, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Sting and Eddie Vedder saluted Pono's sound quality.\n\nNo word on how soon you'll be able to see PonoPlayers in regular retail locations. We're cynical, so we'll opine that the first round of Kickstarter buyers probably doesn't suggest there's a huge market for the device, but it seems there's at least enough to keep it in business until the rest of the world quits buying nice headphones and starts buying nice audio players.", "884": "Well, that was fast.\n\nAt 11:00 p.m. EST Tuesday night, less than 10 hours after launching a Kickstarter page to raise money for his new digital music service PonoMusic and its accompanying player, Neil Young surpassed his goal of $800,000 (R8.7m). Young and the PonoMusic team had set an expiration date of Tuesday, April 15th to raise the necessary funds.\n\nPer Kickstarter rules, project organizers keep any funds raised past the required amount. As Kickstarter notes on their FAQ, \"Most of the time what seems like 'extra' money isn't extra at all. Ten times the funding often means 10 times the backers. More rewards have to be produced and distributed, and creators need that funding to do it (and sometimes some of their own money too).\n\n\"Sometimes when a project is overfunded it lets the creator put that money back into the project to create something better for the backers and themselves. More songs on an album, additional game elements, better materials, etc. In other cases, overfunding leads to better margins and the creator may even profit from the project. This often also means that the creator can continue the project beyond Kickstarter and backers are part of that story.\"\n\nYoung offered multiple rewards for financial contributions, including a \"VIP Dinner & Listening Party\" with the singer and limited edition Pono players signed by Arcade Fire, Pearl Jam, Beck, Foo Fighters and others. All 500 Limited Edition players with Young's signature laser-engraved on the device were sold for a minimum of R4,400 each.\n\nThe singer reached out to many of his musician peers for a testimonial video that accompanied the Kickstarter page. Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, David Crosby, James Taylor, Tom Petty, Sting and a slew of other musical icons provided glowing recommendations for the service.\n\nThe player, which has a suggested retail price of R4,400, will contain 128 gigabytes of memory, which can store between 1,000 and 2,000 high-resolution songs, depending on the resolution and length of the recording. The device will also accept memory cards, which can hold more music and playlists.", "885": "When Neil Young tells you that there\u2019s something out of whack with the way you\u2019re listening to music, then you can\u2019t help but listen, which is what those of us who had assembled in the main hall of the Austin Convention Center were doing on Tuesday afternoon as the legendary rocker paced the stage, eerily resembling Steve Jobs during one of the Apple guru\u2019s famed keynotes.\n\n\u201cThere was really something wrong,\u201d Young said, recounting the period in the \u201980s when the industry crossed over from analog to digital. \u201cAnd it was that we were selling s\u2014t. And people were still buying it because they liked music \u2013 but they were buying wallpaper, they were buying background sounds, they were buying Xeroxes of the Mona Lisa.\u201d\n\nTherein lies the sales pitch for Young\u2019s new music service, Pono: For years now, thanks to the advent first of digital recording, then MP3s, then \u2014 heaven forbid \u2014 streaming, we music fans have been missing out on 95 percent of the information contained in an analog recording. Choosing the convenience of digital over the quality of analog, consumers have been systematically and, to hear Neil tell it, somewhat conspiratorially denied access to the soul of music. Not only has this destroyed the experience of listening to music, it\u2019s wrought havoc on the entire industry.\n\n\u201cThis vibrant, creative culture started to go away,\u201d Young explained, describing an entire class of musicians, studio employees, clerical workers, even deliverymen whose careers were impacted. \u201cAnd it was because of the MP3, and the cheapening of the quality to a point where it was practically unrecognizable.\u201d\n\nAnd so, enter Pono, which is both an iTunes-like music store that sells hi-res audio files as well as a Toblerone-shaped compatible device designed to play them. Neil\u2019s appearance at SXSW Tuesday afternoon was to celebrate the arrival of the service/device/concept on Kickstarter that same day, and before the day\u2019s end, Pono already surpassed its fundraising goal of $800,000. Donors who contributed $300 or more can expect to receive their brand new, music-industry-saving Pono device in\u2026October, at which point one presumes Pono will do a launch event, which this oddly wasn\u2019t. What it was instead was n awkwardly choreographed product announcement (for a product that\u2019s been announced/gestating for years), which would explain Young\u2019s Jobs-ian pacing, not to mention CEO John Hamm\u2019s lack of preparation when the final Q&A participant of the night asked what Pono\u2019s cut of its MP3 sales would be, referring to the 30 percent surcharge Apple slaps its suppliers with.\n\n\u201cIt surprises most people that everyone who buys music from the record labels pays exactly the same amount,\u201d Hamm responded, raising way more questions than he answered and probably drawing the ire of the same majors Pono\u2019s boasting about having deals with (the majors do not like their business being aired in public).\n\nHamm tried to call a time out at that point \u2013 \u201cWe can end it,\u201d he said, gesturing to the moderator \u2013 and in the confusion he got one, the lights going up before anyone had a chance to clarify what he meant. It was a strange note to end on.\n\nBut hey, like I said: When Neil Young tells you there\u2019s something wrong with the way you listen to music, you listen. He\u2019s undoubtedly correct that audio quality has taken a nosedive with the advent of MP3s, that something is missing and it needs to be replaced. Whether or not Pono is the service to replace it remains to be seen. After all, Apple already offers \u201cMastered for iTunes\u201d versions of many new recordings, and pretty much every streaming service is working on high-bit rate streaming, a problem that seems perfectly tractable as bandwidth and storage continues to improve. Neil, for his part, claims to not be especially concerned with whether or not Pono succeeds at all (which might explain why it \u201cstruck out with the investor capitalists\u201d), as long as it changes the conversation.\n\n\u201cIf we fail, and we come out and we try to do this,\u201d he explained toward the end of his address, \u201cwe\u2019ve made enough noise so people know something\u2019s wrong. If some big huge company comes along and kicks our ass with millions and millions of dollars, that\u2019s great for music.\u201d", "886": "If anyone had any doubts that Neil Young could raise $800,000 through Kickstarter to fund his PonoPlayer project that were disowned of the notion within 24 hours. Already over 3,700 people have backed the project to the tune of over $1.2 million. Consider PonoMusic bankrolled.\n\n\u201cPono is Hawaiian for righteous,\u201d the Kickstarter campaign proclaims. \u201cWhat righteous means to our founder Neil Young is honoring the artist\u2019s intention, and the soul of music. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been on a quest, for a few years now, to revive the magic that has been squeezed out of digital music. In the process of making music more convenient \u2013 easier to download, and more portable \u2013 we have sacrificed the emotional impact that only higher quality music can deliver. However, the world has changed in the last 10 years \u2013 technology has solved some of the underlying problems that forced that tradeoff. You no longer have to choose between quality and convenience when listening to music \u2013 you can have both. This is the fundamental idea behind PonoMusic.\u201d\n\nWhile Neil Young is the face of Pono, John Hamm is serving as CEO. Hamm is the business guy, previously having been at Soda Rock Partners and Accept Corporation.\n\n(So you don\u2019t embarrass yourself in conversations\u2026 Pono is what they will call the system \u2013 short of shorthand for everything involving the company. PonoMusic is the music store and website, while PonoPlayer is the device. Also, that first \u201cO\u201d in Pono is long.)\n\nWhile the PonoMusic project was not front page news, it did get enormous coverage. The project hit a nerve as music lovers are getting rather tired of the big tech companies dominating the music business \u2013 especially since they appear to have so little interest in improving their offerings, or cleaning up their online retail stores. Apple got a bye when Steve Jobs was alive because everyone knew what a music lover he was. But Apple offers its digital music in low bit rate files that might have been fine for first generation iPods, but really are not meant for home listening on better stereo systems. They bumped up the bit rate a few years ago, but not anywhere near what PonoMusic wants to deliver.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, mp3 files have a bit rate of 192kbps or 256kbps,\u201d the Pono Kickstarter page states. \u201cThese are highly compressed files and are much smaller in size than higher resolution music files. The good news is that you can keep a lot of mp3 files in a small amount of storage on a portable player or mobile device. The bad news is that they\u2019ve lost a lot of the musical information that often reveals the most pleasant and satisfying aspects of the music. It is mostly that sense of realism, dynamic range, and detail that higher resolution recordings typically capture in a way that restores the emotion in the song.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the low end of higher resolution music (CD lossless, 44.1kHz/16 bit), PonoMusic files have about 6 times more musical information than a typical mp3. With ultra-high resolution recordings (192kHz/24 bit), the difference between a PonoMusic digital file and an mp3 is about 30 times more data from which your player reconstructs the song.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the Pono system is the PonoPlayer, the device needed to play the music. For me, it is the weak link \u2013 do consumers really want another device when they already have both their phones, which as as a player, and their home stereo systems. The real problem is that the PonoPlayer has a mini jack for sound output, which high-end sound equipment use better connections. Assuming you can play the Pono music files on your computer without the dedicated player, we may see many consumers bypassing the player altogether and simply streaming the music to their home systems.\n\nPono Music will use FLAC files, which many music lovers are familiar with as the file format is used by HDTracks.com and other music retailers, and is often the file format of choice for music pirates, as well.", "887": "Neil Young\u2019s investor pitch SXSW presentation came to an embarrassing halt when CEO John Hamm failed to answer a simple question \u2026 \u201cwhat\u2019s your cut?\u201d.\n\nWhat was thought to be a Pono launch was actually a Pono pitch with Young revealing that the much publicised player would not be available until October. The purpose of the SXSW presentation was to solicit crowdfunding.\n\nThat they did well. At the time of the start of the presentation Pono had raised $500,000, half of the expected $1m raise. Later in the evening, $800,000 had been pledged through Crowdfunding via Kickstarter.\n\nHowever, the killer question revolved around what the Pono store would charge artists to sell their music. Young, an artist who sold the labels on the basis that he was \u201cone of them\u201d was supportive when his CEO fumbled. Hamm struggled to answer the question. \u201cIt surprises most people that everyone who buys music from the record labels pays exactly the same amount,\u201d was the answer.\n\nEven Neil Young was taken aback. \u201cThat\u2019s a delicate question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Young said.

We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does exactly that,\" Young said in the release, which was posted on Neil Young News. \"We couldn't be more excited about bringing PonoMusic to the market.\"\n\nThe service will entail both an online music store and the PonoPlayer, which comes in a long, triangular \"Toblerone\" shape as opposed to the usual flat look of most digital music players. The unorthodox design, according to the Pono Kickstarter page, enables the company \"to use larger audio components and to separate them far enough apart to prevent electrical interference between the various subsystems. It also allowed us to use a large cylindrical battery that's much more efficient than a flat battery.\"\n\nMade for audiophiles frustrated with the limited sound quality found on most digital music players, Pono offers potential users what they call the \"highest resolution digital music available,\" with a music resolution rate that ranges from CD lossless, 44.1kHz/16 bit at the low end to 192kHz/24 bit high-resolution. That adds up to sound that at worst has \"six times more musical information than a typical mp3\u2033 to as much as \"30 times more data.\" But the player won't be cheap.", "889": "Neil Young\u2019s Pono passes Kickstarter target on day one\n\nBy Andy Malt | Published on Wednesday 12 March 2014\n\nWell, here\u2019s a thing I\u2019m not sure anyone saw coming. People are paying money to own Neil Young\u2019s silly Pono thing.\n\nIn fact, the Kickstarter campaign to launch the new digital music device passed its $800,000 target within hours of going online, and comfortably sailed passed the $1 million mark too. Those supporting the campaign can opt to buy a variety of Neil Young related nonsense, and pre-order the Pono player itself at a $100 discount on what the device will cost once it goes properly on sale.\n\nThe Pono player, which will cost $400, but is available to Kickstarter campaign participants for $300, mimics the iPod circa 2001, in that it will do nothing but play audio files. They\u2019re FLAC files though, not MP3s, which a series of artists in an introductory video are all keen to tell you are way better.\n\nAnd they are. Though your iPhone can also play these files, and has the added bonus of both being designed to fit in your pocket and to connect to the internet so that you can spend money on silly things that you don\u2019t need.\n\nCheck out all the info, and lay down the cash for a Pono listening party with Neil Young himself, here, and watch the cult induction video here:", "890": "Big name stars help promote new device\n\nNeil Young has called on some of his high profile mates to help with the promo drive for new MP3 platform Pono - but tech experts aren't convinced on the new device.\n\nThe newly designed MP3 player and platform designed by Young enables users to compile high quality MP3's on a new device. The Pono can hold up to 200 high quality albums and is aimed at the more discerning music listener who expects a higher bitrate from their music collection. It is funded through Kickstarter and is currently taking pre-orders through the site.\n\nIn order to help get the word about the new player out, Young has brought in a bunch of his famous friends to provide testimonials. Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Tom Petty, James Taylor, Sting and many more have stated that the quality of sound the player emits is equivalent to what can be heard in the studio.\n\nCheck out a review of the new Pono device below\n\n\"It\u2019s about the people who make the music and the way it sounds to us when we\u2019re in the studio making it,\" says Young. \"It\u2019s about you hearing what we hear. And that hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\"\n\n\"I want to bring back real music,\" he continues. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re on Kickstarter. So that everyone who loves music can share in the release of Pono and the launch of the real music experience in the 21st century.\"\n\nHowever the Pono has met with some resistance in the Tech industry due to its lofty claims, with some sites claiming that a high resolution isn't the answer to audio fidelity. The solution is to advocate for a return to CD-quality audio, not for the absurdly high-rate audio proposed by Young and others,\" writes Gizmodo.\n\nBelow: 13 ways to change how you experience music in 2014", "891": "PonoMusic\u2019s PonoPlayer is a Neil Young-backed music player that has smashed through its $800,000 Kickstarter funding goal in less than a day \u2013 it\u2019s currently at over $1 million in pledges from over 3,300 backers, with 34 days to go until the campaign ends \u2013 and seems to be the next iPod killer. According to the team behind it, PonoMusic aims to deliver a better listening experience than regular MP3 players, but the device will also be quite expensive.\n\n\u201cPonoMusic is an end-to-end ecosystem for music lovers to get access to and enjoy their favorite music exactly as the artist created it, at the recording resolution they chose in the studio,\u201d the company wrote on Kickstarter. \u201cWe offer PonoMusic customers the highest resolution digital music available. PonoMusic is more than just a high-resolution music store and player; it is a grassroots movement to keep the heart of music beating.\u201d\n\nThe Toblerone-shaped PonoPlayer will get music from a PonoMusic.com store that can be synced with the device by connecting it to a computer. After that, the MP3 player can be used with regular headphones, but it also has a special jack for connecting it to a home or car audio system.\n\nThe PonoPlayer\u2019s best feature is music tracks quality, at least according to the team. A PonoMusic file will have \u201cabout 6 more musical information than a typical MP3 file,\u201d according to the company. \u201cWith ultra-high resolution recordings (192kHz/24 bit), the difference between a PonoMusic digital file and an mp3 is about 30 times more data from which your player reconstructs the \u2018song.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe PonoPlayer will sell for $399 when it launches, with the cheapest Kickstarter price being $200 \u2013 however, the Early Bird deal is long gone, and currently there are several full-price options for backers interested in purchasing it. The PonoPlayer will ship at some point in October.\n\nThe following video offers more details about the PonoPlayer and its music playing abilities.", "892": "Neil Young has revealed that his iPod rivalling PonoPlayer is set to hit Kickstarter in March and will eventually go on sale with a price tag of $399.\n\nAnnounced back in September 2012, the PonoPlayer is for those who like their audio with a slathering of high fidelity.\n\nComing with 128GB storage, the media player is touting itself as the best MP3 player around, offering sumptuous sounds through its digital filters.\n\nThe key to making the music better is apparently leaving the echo in songs. The iPod and the like are said to strip out this natural sound from music and the PonoPlayer leaves it in.\n\nThis is according to Neil Young, who apparently knows a bit about music so we aren't going to argue with him.\n\nWhat if Bono made Pono?\n\nYoung is set to show off the PonoPlayer at this year's SXSW, alongside a music download store called PonoMusic.\n\n\"It's about the music, real music,\" says Young in a press release.\n\n\"We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does that. We couldn't be more excited about bringing PonoMusic to the market,\"\n\nThat quote isn't exactly up there with the lyrics to Old Man but it will be interesting to see another device rockin' in the free world of MP3 devices.\n\nBut will people buy an iPod competitor, when even the iPod is struggling in an iPhone world?

But now, there are finally some real details: from March 15th, you'll be able to pre-order one on Kickstarter for $400 (\u00a3240).\n\nThe big, bright triangular digital music player provides \"studio master-quality digital music at the highest audio fidelity possible\" according to PonoMusic, which gives listeners the ability to \"experience music the way the artists intended.\" It remains to be seen exactly how accurate that is\u2014and whether there's consumer demand for it\u2014but it's kind of neat that the Canadian rocker is pushing the idea so hard.\n\nThe music player has 128GB of memory and can \"store from about 100 to 500 high-resolution digital-music albums,\" though you'll be able to expand that with a memory card. It also has both a touchscreen LCD and some physical buttons, too.\n\nIt's designed to work with an associated PonoMusic.com service, which will provide users with \"the finest quality, highest-resolution digital music from both major labels and prominent independent labels.\" It's not been confirmed yet who exactly that will include, though hopefully there's a decent stash available to listen to by the time the device is launched. One nice piece of news is that the device will, apparently, not feature any DRM restrictions.\n\nWhether a standalone portable digital music player is what the world really needs in 2014 is up for debate.

She told talk show host Jay Leno: 'I can honestly say it was the greatest challenge of my life.'\n\nThe Queen of Miami: Kim certainly lapped up the attention as she posed on her balcony\n\n\n\nAnd Kim has also hit back at suggestions she had used 'butt implants' to enhance her shapely rear.\n\n\n\nShe recently went on a lengthy Twitter rant and seethed: 'I'm seeing all these nonsense tabloids claiming I have butt implants-injections.\n\n\n\n'Get a life!

And isn\u2019t it just our fabulous luck \u2014 one of our favorite performers, Majesty Rose, sang one of our favorite jams, \u201cLet It Go,\u201d by the Wicked-ly talented Adele Dazeem! Sorry \u2014 we mean Idina Menzel. (Has that gotten old yet? Just kidding \u2014 we know that it could never get old.) Anyway, read on for our full recap and to find out how Majesty fared!\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 Recap: Sam Woolf, Jessica Meuse, CJ Harris & Dexter Roberts Perform\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=\u201d25665520\u2033]\n\n1. Sam Woolf, \u201cCome Together,\u201d by The Beatles, from Across The Universe\n\nPre-performance, some behind the scenes footage showed the Idol hopefuls doing their best Sam Woolf impressions. Mostly, they involve being super quiet and adored by girls. We also saw some clips of the ladies going bananas over our #1 Idol boyfriend \u2014 he has got to be getting so much play right now. Anyway, right, his singing: it was not great. The judges agreed that it was refreshing to see this side of him, but that his performance was \u201caverage,\u201d as Harry Connick Jr. put it.\n\n2. Jessica Meuse, \u201cThe Sound Of Silence,\u201d by Simon & Garfunkel, from The Graduate\n\nThis was probably our favorite performance from Jessica. However, right before her performance, she told Ryan Seacrest that she has had \u201cThe Sound Of Silence\u201d on her setlist for tons of the shows that she plays in smoky bars in Slapout, Alabama, etc. etc.. Maybe she could have taken a bigger risk? Also, mid-performance, she biffed her guitar-playing so bad that you could see Harry wince. During judging, however, he put it on the band. Sounded like Jessica to us, but we\u2019re not the experts \u2014 and Harry\u2019s not shy. They agreed that this song was definitely in her wheelhouse but that she still needs to step it up.\n\n3. CJ Johnson, \u201cCan\u2019t You See,\u201d by The Marshall Tucker Band, from Blow\n\nCJ did a fantastic job on this song. Harry told him that he pulled his way to the front of the competition, and Jennifer Lopez agreed with the sentiment, calling him a \u201cfrontrunner!\u201d\n\n4. Dexter Roberts, \u201cSweet Home Alabama,\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd, from Forrest Gump\n\nFirst of all, Caleb Johnson does the best impressions and is generally hilarious. In his behind-the-scenes impression of Dexter, he said that he literally can\u2019t take his hat off because he\u2019s missing the top part of his skull. Perfect. To prove Caleb wrong, we suppose, Dexter came out hatless and singing \u201cSweet Home Alabama,\u201d because obviously. He did a great job \u2014 the audience, judges, and even contestants were jamming along.\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 Recap: Ben Briley, Majesty Rose, Caleb Johnson & MK Nobilette Perform\n\n5. Ben Briley, \u201cBennie And The Jets,\u201d by Elton John, from 27 Dresses\n\nFirstly, all props to Ben Briley for choosing a song from this cinematic masterpiece starring Katherine Heigl. Second, my gosh, easily the best performance of the night so far. His cover was original, his vocals were on point, and he owned the stage \u2014 which we haven\u2019t really seen from him so far. Jennifer made a good point, though, that it didn\u2019t really seem true to who he was as a singer, as he\u2019s been super country so far. Maybe that\u2019s why we like him so much now? We\u2019re sorry \u2014 we just don\u2019t love country!\n\n\n\n6. Majesty Rose, \u201cLet It Go,\u201d by Idina Menzel, from Frozen\n\nOh my gosh, you guys. A performance of \u201cLet It Go.\u201d The stakes literally could not be higher. In an incredibly disappointing turn of events, because we love this song and we love Majesty, she\u2026 could have done better. Harry, the toughest of critics, told her that her performance was strong but that he\u2019s starting to lose sight of her style as a performer. Jennifer told her, however, that her being all over the map is more of a positive; that she can be a singer, actress, theatre performer, anything! But \u2014 she definitely missed a few of those notes, right? Are we crazy? Please let us know!\n\n\n\n7. Caleb Johnson, \u201cSkyfall,\u201d by Adele, from Skyfall\n\nJessica\u2019s impression of Caleb: \u201cI\u2019m like if Jack Black and Meatloaf had a baby.\u201d That is so spot-on, wow. Nicely done, Jessica. Anyway, the judges have been telling Caleb for a little while now that he needs to branch out from his retro choices, and singing \u201cSkyfall\u201d was the perfect way for him to showcase his amazing vocal talents while captivating his audience.\n\n8. MK Nobilette, \u201cMake You Feel My Love,\u201d by Bob Dylan, from Hope Floats\n\nThis was a great showing from MK. Last week, the judges told her that she had problems connecting with the audience, and she totally listened and brought it this week. Keith Urban told her that she lost herself in the song; in doing so, the audience was right there with her and totally connected to the performance.\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 Recap: Alex Preston, Jena Irene & Majesty Rose Perform\n\n9. Alex Preston, \u201cFalling Slowly,\u201d by Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova, from Once\n\nYou know we\u2019re into Alex Preston singing a beautiful love song. Sure, we\u2019re biased \u2014 but the judges agreed that his performance was really special. What else can we say? We take it back \u2014 sorry, Ben, but Alex is definitely the MVP of the night for us!\n\n10. Jena Irene, \u201cDecode,\u201d by Paramore, from Twilight\n\nThe Top 11 is super talented right now, but we just have to say it: as interesting as all of the other performers are, Jena is by far the most consistent, most talented vocalist of the bunch. If she gets voted off any time soon, it will be a crime. She got a standing ovation from the judges table! Well, except for Harry. Keith was spot-on when he told her that when she\u2019s on the piano, there is a \u201cferocity\u201d to her performance. Hey, and Jennifer agrees with us \u2014 \u201cAmerica, get on board!\u201d Also \u2014 sorry to my BF Alex because we\u2019ve changed our minds again \u2014 Jena for the win! Best of the night, for sure.\n\n11. Malaya Watson, \u201cI Am Changing,\u201d by Jennifer Hudson, from Dreamgirls\n\nThe contestants\u2019 impressions of Malaya are strongly influenced by a) jumping around a whole lot, and b) using a tuba as a prop. Um, they\u2019re pretty great. What\u2019s even better is Randy Jackson holding the tuba and standing next to Ryan when he introduced Malaya. So that\u2019s where Randy has been all night! Holding a tuba. Well, OK! Anyway, holy crap, Malaya was a powerhouse singing this song! Another standing ovation! Can\u2019t Malaya, Alex and Jena share the title of American Idol? Honestly!\n\n\n\nJust a quick thought before we wrap this up: I, personally, think that it\u2019s very unwise to display the live voting results during the show. Not only is it a self-esteem crusher \u2014 especially mid-show when some have not even had the chance to perform \u2014 but it must be skewing the voting. If you see that one of your faves is in the top, you may be disinclined to put all your votes on them, feeling confident about their place in the voting food chain. Therefore, you may decide to place your votes on your second favorite, leaving your first favorite to fall \u2014 and possibly to the bottom! Are you feeling me on this? Anyway, trust me \u2014 this whole thing is a bad idea.\n\nAnyway, what did you think, HollywoodLifers? This was definitely a fantastic bunch of performances, but whose was your favorite? Be sure to VOTE and comment below!\n\n\u2014 Amanda Michelle Steiner\n\nMore \u2018American Idol\u2019:", "911": "Eleven finalists are still standing on American Idol, at least for the time being. This week, the contestants perform songs of the cinema, with Thursday\u2019s results show revealing the identities of the Top 1o. The incentive to make it this far means securing a spot on the summer American Idol tour. And of course, everyone still wants to win the ultimate prize. So, them\u2019s the stakes!\n\nLast week, we bid a fond farewell to Emily Piriz. This week, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who will be going home, as the competition is fierce between those who have proven themselves good enough to remain in the competition.\n\nThe judges take to the stage and Jennifer Lopez is electrifying in her bright pink top and capri pants. Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. certainly make up in energy what they lack in brightly-colored outfits. The first performer of the evening is tween heartthrob, Sam Woolf.\n\nThis week\u2019s \u201chumorous\u201d gag involves contestants doing an impersonation of each other. It\u2019s pretty lame. Seventeen-year-old Sam sings The Beatles\u2018 \u201cCome Together.\u201d (That was in a movie? Oh, right \u2014 Across the Universe.) He works the crowd and appears very confident. Keith thinks it\u2019s a good improvement overall. Jennifer wants him to own it and throw out a little more \u201cpersonality in the vocal,\u201d but calls it \u201ca nice start to the show.\u201d Harry thinks Sam\u2019s on his way, but needs to keep working hard, saying, \u201cPretty good job.\u201d\n\nNext is Jessica Meuse, singing \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel from The Graduate. Jennifer is the first to comment, saying it\u2019s \u201cthe perfect song for you.\u201d But she feels that she \u201cnever got her groove on all together.\u201d Harry gives her props for staying focused, even though the band was off. He calls it, \u201ca nice job.\u201d Keith compliments her look and I agree. He gives her some tips on how to handle the mic, since she\u2019s no longer in a tiny, smoky bar.\n\nRyan chats with Jennifer and she is beyond adorable, trying to Instagram a photo. Now, it\u2019s C.J. Harris on the stage. His choice for a movie song is \u201cCant You See\u201d by The Marshall Tucker Band from Blow. Harry believes it was the perfect song selection and performance, saying the performance was \u201cvery, very strong.\u201d Keith concurs: \u201cYou completely nailed that right there.\u201d Jennifer rounds out the very positive review from the entire panel.\n\nCountry boy Dexter Roberts is rocking some Bob\u2019s Big Boy hair. Randy Jackson returns to the stage for Dexter\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s singing \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynrd (from Forrest Gump \u2014 though shouldn\u2019t these at least be songs that originated from soundtracks or something?) Confident with his new hairdo, Dexter definitely picked the most appropriate song. Keith immediately compliments his haircut and how Dexter\u2019s loosened up. JLo loved it, but needed more personality and Harry agrees. Still, he calls the performance \u201csolid.\u201d\n\nBen Briley has finally combed his hair off his face, I\u2019m happy to see, and he\u2019s wearing a forest green and charcoal suit. Doesn\u2019t he look grown? He sings Elton John\u2018s \u201cBenny and the Jets\u201d from Twenty Seven Dresses. (Okay, sure.) For the performance, Ben sits at the piano. He gets bonus points from me for never having seen the movie. Jennifer says she\u2019s confused by Ben\u2019s genre mixing and although she thought he performed well, she wasn\u2019t sold on the song choice. Harry wasn\u2019t convinced either. Keith worries if Ben\u2019s authenticity is getting lost in translation.\n\nTo add to the voting excitement and to simultaneously terrify the contestants, host Ryan Seacrest shows off some real-time results that have C.J. ranked as the overall favorite. It\u2019s now Majesty Rose\u2019s turn and she performs \u201cLet It Go\u201d by from Frozen. Majesty Rose is confident and hits the perfect tone and looks picture perfect in her flower-print dress and Peter Pan collar. Harry calls her \u201ca mystery,\u201d but says that she came out strong. Keith thinks the song was slightly too big for her. JLo thinks she can do anything.\n\nMeanwhile, these fake auditions are constant reminders that these contestants are singers and definitely not actors.\n\nRock and roller Caleb Johnson is ready to do his thing with his interpretation of Adele\u2018s Oscar winning \u201cSkyfall\u201d from the James Bond film of the same name. His hair is definitely extra fluffy. A nod to the song\u2019s original vocalist, perhaps? The song was a great choice and definitely my favorite performance of the evening so far. Well done, Caleb! Keith says it was \u201cnot predictable\u201d and \u201can amazing choice.\u201d JLo is so excited, she gets momentarily tongue-tied. Harry echoes their sentiment, stating, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very hard to beat.\u201d\n\nMy girl MK Nobillette kills it with a soulful version of \u201cMake You Feel My Love\u201d from Hope Floats, starring none other than Mr. Harry Connick. Jennifer makes her gorgeous, trademark \u201cI\u2019m About to Cry\u201d face. And just like that, MK is back in the game. Jennifer says, \u201cI really loved that,\u201d comparing her to k.d. lang. Harry loves the simplicity of her performance. Keith loves when she loses herself in the moment. Crazy Emmanuel shouts his praise from the audience. Ha!\n\nAlex Preston sings \u201cFalling Slowly,\u201d another Oscar winner for Best Original Song, by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova from the movie Once. Harry is very complimentary saying, \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d Keith compliments Alex on his\u201draw fragility.\u201d Jennifer says simply, \u201cBeautiful.\u201d\n\nNext to the stage is Jena Irene, who performs Paramore\u2018s \u201cDecode\u201d from Twilight. She sits at the piano with strobe lights and smoke machine. Jennifer\u2019s super into it. Keith compliments her \u201cferocity.\u201d JLo says, \u201cAmerica, please get on board with this!\u201d Harry thinks she did a great job with her interpretation of the song.\n\nLast for the night is Malaya Watson, who sings \u201cI Am Changing\u201d from Dreamgirls. Oh, man, she is just fantastic. With those braces, no less. Jennifer stands up in her seat to applaud Malaya. She yells, \u201cGood girl, Malaya!\u201d Harry compliments her big voice and tells her \u201cgreat job.\u201d Keith thinks she does a great job picking her songs and dubs her, \u201cmagnificent.\u201d\n\nNow, get thee to a votery, because it\u2019s time to let American Idol know how you feel. And Thursday night, let\u2019s gather to see who made the cut.\n\nGet an eyeful of even more pop music coverage, from artist interviews to exclusive performances, on Idolator\u2019s YouTube channel.", "912": "American Idol 11 Finalists Perform Season 13 Episode 18 Editor\u2019s Rating 3 stars * * * * * \u00ab Previous Next \u00bb Photo: Michael Becker / FOX\n\nYou guys, tonight renewed my faith in American Idol season 13.

It\u2019s that tonight\u2019s theme is Movie Songs, and not one of the top 11 chose Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing.\u201d No, I\u2019m serious. Leaving that song out feels like a violation of Singing Show Rules, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re all revolutionaries.\n\nOh, also Harry Connick, Jr. just will not stop with the Randy Jackson shade, and it\u2019s too delicious for words. Ryan asks him what he\u2019s looking for from the top 11, and he says he just made up a catchphrase of his very own: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be in it to win it.\u201d It\u2019s not even done in an affectionate way, either. It\u2019s like: \u201cHey, fuck Randy Jackson, am I right?\u201d You are right, Harry. Let\u2019s be best friends.\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s get into the performances.\n\nSam Woolf: \u201cCome Together\u201d by the Beatles\n\nThis song was in Across the Universe, of course, but I prefer to think about the Aerosmith version from Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Have you seen Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band? Starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton? With George Burns singing \u201cFixing A Hole\u201d to a group of confused children, and Steve Martin mugging his way through \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer?\u201d If not, it\u2019s on Netflix Instant, and if you want to see the most effective anti-cocaine advertisement the world has ever produced, you really should check it out. Anyway, tonight Sam does the dullest version of this song I have ever heard, by a wide margin. Not much movement, no vocal variety, he\u2019s just sittin\u2019 on a stack of amps, tellin\u2019 the girls about toejam football. It\u2019s like a folk-mass version of \u201cCome Together.\u201d Keith says he\u2019s glad we saw this side of him, but this side is exactly like the other side. Jen says she wanted personality. Harry calls it an \u201caverage performance\u201d but says he\u2019s on his way, which is as close to a total pan as he\u2019s going to get tonight. The suits at Fox have gotten to him.\n\nJessica Meuse: \u201cThe Sounds of Silence\u201d by Simon & Garfunkel\n\nJessica says she has sung this song in bars a million times, which makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t result in a confident performance. It is merely decent. No emotional connection, no audience connection, a ton of vibrato. Classic Jessica. Harry notices that the band was off during a portion of the song, and he\u2019s right. The band seems to be off a lot. What\u2019s the deal with the band this season? Is Randy back there telling jokes? (Here\u2019s a terrific joke Randy would tell the band: \u201cI\u2019m in this band! That\u2019s my guitar! WHAT! CRAZY.\u201d) Jen says she thinks Jessica can win this whole thing, and based on what I\u2019ve seen so far, she\u2019s not wrong. How depressing a thought is that?\n\nC.J. Harris: \u201cCan\u2019t You See?\u201d by the Marshall Tucker Band\n\nOkay, here we go. From the first note, you can tell this is going to be great. Granted, this is a song C.J. knows well, but what\u2019s the problem with that? His performance is lived-in and emotional and warm. Not even the band can fuck it up. Best performance of the season so far, says me! We finally have a front-runner! The season can begin! Harry agrees; he says C.J. sang his way back into the forefront of the competition. Praise Jesus.\n\nSo, okay, let\u2019s talk about Randy Jackson for a minute. Exactly what kind of deal did Idol offer Randy Jackson this season? Exactly what\u2019s wrong with Randy Jackson that he would accept this deal? Because here\u2019s what they\u2019ve had him do so far this year: Meet the finalists, make quiet, vague observations in the corner of the screen about how they\u2019ll have to sing well if they hope to continue, and tonight just pop up silently twice while Harry Connick Jr. openly mocks him. Is his salary that high, or is his self-esteem that low?\n\nDexter Roberts: \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nThis song was apparently in Forrest Gump. What a boon Forrest Gump has been for unimaginative singing-show contestants on Movie Night! (A more adventurous singer might choose something fun from the American Hustle soundtrack, but tonight is not the night.) Ryan reminds us that it was also in Sweet Home Alabama, and then adds, \u201cJosh Lucas!\u201d If you\u2019re wondering who still remembers Josh Lucas, the answer is Ryan Seacrest. Anyway, this is a fun version of the song, but not revelatory in any way. It\u2019ll get the country people awful excited, though. The judges kinda feel the same way as I do. Faint praise all around. It\u2019s all he needs, really.\n\nBen Briley: \u201cBennie & The Jets\u201d by Elton John\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Ben Briley? How do you hold a perfect 50/50 mix of Ryan Gosling and Danny Cooksey in your hand? A few weeks ago, he was my pick to win the whole thing, but he hasn\u2019t been able to form a consistent identity. Tonight, for example, he\u2019s in a suit and his hair is slicked back, and while the effect is definitely yowza, it almost comes too soon. One almost wants the Reveal of the New Look to come a tiny bit later. In Top 11 week, it just reads as identity confusion. So does his performance; it\u2019s far from the last few weeks\u2019 country outings, but not in any discernible direction. It\u2019s a departure for sure, but where is he going? Harry calls it \u201clacksadaisical.\u201d Hey, America: though it means \u201cexcessively relaxed,\u201d the word is \u201clackadaisical.\u201d If we\u2019re going to be such graceless dicks about having to press one for English, let\u2019s take a moment and learn the language, can we, please? Harry succinctly adds that he still hasn\u2019t heard the real Ben, and it\u2019s such a good call, I\u2019m going to let the whole thing slide.\n\nMajesty Rose: \u201cLet It Go\u201d by Idina Menzel\n\nBoy, that Adele Dazeem thing proved that we can\u2019t have nice things anymore, didn\u2019t it? It went from exciting blooper to Twitter clich\u00e9 to Slate quiz to Facebook feed bugaboo in less than 12 hours. Let\u2019s burn the internet down, you wanna? Anyway, Majesty says this song was written just for her, but if that\u2019s the case, then why can\u2019t we hear her in the opening lines at all? Seems like if it were written for her, it should be in her range, but maybe she\u2019s just not all that picky. I had Majesty pegged for the Top 2 weeks ago, but she\u2019s been stumbling for the last couple of weeks. She makes up for it tonight by prancing. Prancing and stumbling. This is a huge song right now, so I feel like she might end up in the bottom three, but end up safe. Harry says if she\u2019s going to try a million new things, she needs to be better at all of them. Harry is learning how to speak painful truths without making the audience call for his head.\n\nCaleb Johnson: \u201cSkyfall\u201d by Adele\n\nI am straight-up, get-out-of-my-seat stunned that Caleb didn\u2019t choose \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d It\u2019s such a shocker that I almost forget how boring \u201cSkyfall\u201d is until about halfway through his performance. He is in fine voice, as ever, but this song is Snooze City. The judges go nuts, just because it wasn\u2019t a predictable rock song. Harry says the competition started tonight, and I don\u2019t disagree, and I hope for this show\u2019s sake that we\u2019re right. Me and Harry. We\u2019re such a good team, except he doesn\u2019t know it or care.\n\nMK Nobillette: \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201d by Bob Dylan\n\nOh, this song. This aching, gorgeous song. I love it, and it is the perfect song for MK, in that it comes across best when it is sung the least. It\u2019s one of the rare songs that can easily be oversung, and \u2026 let\u2019s just say MK is in no danger of over-performing any time soon. Tonight, she actually gives a really beautiful performance, even if her affect is still tentative. Jennifer compares her to k.d. lang (almost apologetically), Harry says it was solid but didn\u2019t need the runs (and he\u2019s right), and Keith says there were glimpses of the star she could be (and seriously, if all else fails, she will be Northampton, Mass.\u2019s most popular coffeehouse entertainer). Ryan ruins it all by sneaking up behind her and saying \u201cSomeone wants to be here. Someone wants to prove herself.\u201d Like she\u2019s a puppy.\n\nOh, also, throughout this whole show, there\u2019s a running gag where the top 11 audition for the parts of each other. So you get to see how they really feel about each other after having spent so much time together. They have insights like: Sam wears hats and Majesty likes flowers and some of Jessica\u2019s hair is pink. Deep stuff. If you\u2019re going to have people impersonate each other, you might want to make sure they have personalities.\n\nAlex Preston: \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova\n\nThough they mostly state the obvious in these comedy segments, everyone kind of goes nuts in the Alex Preston segments. He\u2019s a cipher, our Alex, but at least he\u2019s putting something consistently interesting out there. You kind of already know what this performance sounds like, and you\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s nice and intimate. Harry says he loves the lack of fireworks, Keith loves the authenticity, Jennifer thinks it\u2019s perfect.\n\nJena Irene: \u201cDecode\u201d by Paramore\n\nRyan is apparently a big Twilight fan, and he mentions the scene where Edward stops the van with his bare hand so it doesn\u2019t crush Kristen Stewart, which, like, even I know that scene. Ryan doesn\u2019t have anyone making fun of his feyness this season, so he\u2019s taking the task on himself, and it\u2019s beginning to bum me out. Anyway. Jena\u2019s performance is very shouty, and even though it\u2019s from Twilight and the judges love it, I think she might be in the bottom three again.\n\nMalaya Watson: \u201cI Am Changing\u201d by Jennifer Holliday\n\nSo, before the commercial break, Ryan tells us Malaya has chosen a song from Dreamgirls, and I just go ahead and type \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going.\u201d And then she says it\u2019s not that song, and I type \u201cListen.\u201d And then she starts this song, which is not only kind of a deep cut, but a super-smart song choice for her. It\u2019s as dynamic a song as the other two, but it\u2019s even better because she actually is changing! I kinda fall back in love with her tonight, folks. The judges love it, too.\n\nSo there it is, people. I think Majesty, Jena, and Sam are in trouble tomorrow. And whoever gets voted off, I think they\u2019ll have Randy Jackson dress like a clown and sweep them off the stage.", "913": "The American Idol 2014 Top 11 took to the stage Wednesday night to perform songs from the cinema and there were some standout performances.

He showed true confidence and personality. Sam proved that he was not ready to leave and the audience agreed. Unlike the judges, I enjoyed the humility that Sam has as he performs and do not think he needs to feel like he is a \"star\" to be one.\n\nJessica Meuse was next to perform with her rendition of \"Sound of Silence.\" This was a perfect song choice for her tone, but the timing seemed a bit off towards the end of her performance. I believe this timing was the fault of the band tonight, so I commend Jessica for pushing through. I loved seeing Jessica in her element tonight with regards to the song, but I agree with Jennifer Lopez that Jessica needs to show that she is ready to win American Idol. I also agreed with Keith Urban's comment that the contestants need to adapt to their environments and explore the opportunities that different crowds will provide.\n\nNext to perform was CJ Harris who performed the song \"Can't You See.\" CJ started his performance with great passion, tone, and control. This was an excellent song choice for CJ. He brought out his personality without having to move all over the stage. I absolutely loved CJ's performance tonight and have no doubt that he will make it into the Top 10 this season.\n\nDexter Roberts next performed with the song \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" I think this was a great choice for Dexter. Dexter stayed true to his roots and showed what kind of artist he will be with this song. I do think Dexter could have added a bit more personality to the song and moved around the stage more, but this was a good performance.\n\nThe show continued with a unique song choice from Ben Briley. Ben performed \"Bennie and the Jets\" on tonight's episode. I loved the piano playing, but was expecting more with the vocals. Ben could have really worked the crowd with this song, but instead I feel that he played it a little safe. I think Ben took a risk with the high notes in the end of the song, but I do not think it paid off.\n\nUp next was Majesty Rose who sang \"Let It Go\" from the movie \"Frozen.\" I thought parts of her performance were strong, while other parts lacked. Some of Majesty's high notes needed more control and I hope that she can improve on this aspect if she is put through to the next round.\n\nCaleb Johnson was up next with the song \"Skyfall.\" This was an interesting choice for Caleb. I was so happy to see him slow it down tonight and really show off his vocal abilities. Even without the dramatic stage productions that he has had in the past, Caleb proved that he will be going somewhere big. I thought this was a great moment for Caleb Johnson.\n\nMK Nobilette performed \"To Make You Feel My Love\" from Harry Connick Jr.'s own movie \"Hope Floats.\" I have performed this song and can say that it is indeed difficult to pull off the emotion while keeping control. I believe MK did a great job tonight and truly connected with her audience with this performance. As the judges said, MK can pull off so much powerful meaning with such simplicity.\n\nAlex Preston performed the song \"Falling Slowly.\" I absolutely loved this performance. I could feel emotion with every line that he sang. The realness that he brought to the lyrics easily brought the audience to tears. Although it is still early in the season... I must say my pick for Season 13's American Idol is Alex Preston.\n\nJena Irene next performed with her rendition of the song \"Decode\" as heard on \"Twilight.\" I did enjoy the power behind Jena's voice, but I did not think it was great. I did not agree with Jennifer Lopez that this was the best performance of the night. Coming back from the bottom three, I thought Jena needed to blow America away and I just don't know if she did tonight.\n\nLast to perform tonight was Malaya Watson singing \"I Am Changing\" from the movie \"Dreamgirls.\" This performance was perfection. Malaya showed immense passion and control throughout this song. Her stage presence was wonderful as always. This was easily the best performance of the night and was a great way to end the episode. I truly enjoyed this performance. I believe all of the contestants brought their strengths to the stage tonight and I am interested to see who will be moving on to the Top 10.\n\nI would have to say that my bottom three contestants based on tonight are Jena Irene, Ben Briley and Dexter Roberts.\n\nAlthough these artists performed well, the competition is tough, and I do not think they were at the same level as some of the others. But, as always, it is up to America.\n\nJohn Gonzalez is a statewide entertainment writer for MLive.com. Email him at gonzo@mlive.com or follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+.", "916": "On Wednesday night, the remaining 11 American Idol contestants took on the theme, \"Songs of the Cinema,\" which apparently inspired Jennifer Lopez to come out dressed like the Pink Panther.\n\nWith so many contestants failing to connect to the audience last week, was there any hope that the movie-inspired music would give them a little boost of the emotion and drama that was sorely lacking last week? The odds didn't seem that good until C.J. Harris performed and kicked off a Season 13 comeback! Can you call it a comeback, when it's really the first time all the American Idol contestants did well?\n\nSam Woolf: Sam opted to sing, \"Come Together,\" by The Beatles. Sam tried to add a little edge to his persona after all his fellow contestants teased him about living in a retirement community with his Granddad as a wingman. The satin blazer and black jeans added a touch of coolness to Sam's performance but the arrangement of the song was a touch painful. The judges liked that Sam is loosening up but Jennifer Lopez was looking for a big rock star not \"baby rock star.\" B-\n\nJessica Meuse: If any Idol needed to make a comeback after last week, it was Jessica. She hoped to strike last week's bland, wooden performance from the viewers' memories with a rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's, \"Sound of Silence,\" which she called a deep and introspective song. Jennifer had hoped that Jessica would have wowed the audience more, especially since she's been touting her extensive experience performing. Harry Connick Jr. noted that the band made a mistake but he appreciated that Jessica stayed focused. Chances are, the viewers won't appreciate that focus as much as they would have appreciated just a touch of levity to her performance and her persona. C+\n\nC.J. Harris: Our boy from Alabama (or one of them) opted to sing, \"Can't You See,\" from the movie \"Blow.\" Within the first few notes his girlfriend was in tears and Jennifer was flinging her pink self around like a maniac. It was much stronger than his last few performances and the judges loved it. Harry said that C.J. sang himself back into the forefront of the competition. A-\n\nDexter Roberts: Dexter decided to shock all of America by choosing a song that no one would have ever expected. Just kidding. Dexter selected, \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" because when the judges hinted that he was predictable and unoriginal this was obviously the best course of action. The judges liked his performance but reiterated that Dexter needs to differentiate himself, otherwise he's just doing covers. Some would argue that mumbling through the song is Dexter's own unique touch. B\n\nBen Briley: Ben grew up with Elton John; well, not really with Elton himself but with Elton's music, so \"Bennie and The Jets,\" was the natural choice for him. What wasn't as natural was seeing Ben cleaned up and \"playing\" the piano. Jennifer was trying to get her head around Ben's transition from country to Elton in one week. Harry said the performance seemed kind of pointless and all the judges were sharing in the confusion. C+\n\nMajesty Rose: Majesty decided to, \"Let It Go,\" by performing the Oscar-winning song of the same name, from \"Frozen.\" What is she letting go? Well, the chance of someone perceiving her as an adult, for one. The bobby socks didn't help matters and her vocals didn't do her any favors either. Harry, apparently weakened by the exhausting work of judging, seemed to experience a break with reality when he said the performance was strong. The other judges were less convinced but no one seemed to share my experience of rolling around on the floor, begging for the sound to stop. D\n\nCaleb Johnson: Caleb elected to sing, \"Skyfall,\" from the movie of the same name and it was a refreshing break from his usual schtick. Keith Urban agreed and was impressed by Caleb's versatility and Harry said it was fantastic and that the competition didn't really start until last night. A-\n\nMK Nobilette: After a rather dismal performance last week, MK tried to make us feel her love this week with, \"To Make You Feel My Love,\" from Harry's movie, \"Hope Floats.\" If there was an award for most improved, MK took the cake Wednesday night. She was almost riveting and the judges agreed with Jennifer comparing her to K.D. Lang. A-\n\nAlex Preston: Alex sang, \"Falling Slowly,\" from the movie, \"Once.\" (On a side note, does anyone else think that Alex sounds a little like Adam Sandler when he sings?) He chose a great song and performed it beautifully. Harry said he was very proud of Alex and Keith called him \"raw and fragile\" and loves his artistry. A\n\nJena Irene: Choosing the Paramore song \"Decode\" from Ryan Seacrest's favorite movie, \"Twilight,\" Jena kept the excitement of the show going strong. Her performance at the piano was powerful and dynamic and brought Keith and Jen to their feet. She also looked incredible! A-\n\nMalaya Watson: Dreamgirls had a big impact on Malaya so she closed out the show with, \"I Am Changing.\" Although the performance felt a little \"pageanty,\" (this is Malaya, after all) she had a really strong vocal and handled the big song remarkably well. The judges loved her and predicted that with time Malaya would only get better. B+\n\nPredictions:\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

But when some shine it makes the gaps in talent all the more obvious. This week my senses are telling me that these three will find themselves in the bottom:\n\nMajesty Rose Jessica Meuse Ben Briley\n\nWhat did you think about the performances this week? Is anyone ready to agree with Harry's far-fetched argument that this is the best talent of any season? Sound off in the comments below!", "917": "It\u2019s movie night on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which means a bunch of songs loosely connected to the big screen. And thankfully, some much-needed breakouts.\n\nThere\u2019s also, always Harry Connick, Jr. This year\u2019s most engaging judge hijacks Randy Jackson\u2019s woefully lame catchphrase \u2014 IN IT TO WIN IT! \u2014 to hilarious effect. Oh, Harry. What would we do without you? (And, no, Randy. This doesn\u2019t mean you can start using it again.)\n\nLights, camera, action!\n\n)\n\nSam Woolf: \u201cCome Together.\u201d ALRIGHT. I think it\u2019s time to face facts. Sam just isn\u2019t very good. And he may never be. He\u2019s doing nothing with this song. At all. It\u2019s limp and lifeless and feels twice as long. There are no dynamics in his voice. No fire. No color.\n\nKeith Urban wants him to \u201cget looser.\u201d Jennifer Lopez calls him \u201cbaby rock star.\u201d Harry Connick, Jr. thinks he\u2019s \u201con the way.\u201d (Shouldn\u2019t he be there by now?)\n\nJessica Meuse: \u201cThe Sound of Silence.\u201d Jessica has said for the past two weeks, at least, that the song she\u2019s performing has been a part of her setlist for a long time. Maybe that\u2019s the problem. She needs to push herself past what\u2019s comfortable if she wants to start making an impact. The song is too slow. The arrangement goes nowhere. The band is off. Jessica is a nonentity at this point, and she shouldn\u2019t be. She\u2019s talented but needs a stronger hand directing her and pushing her. I also am not sure about the makeover. They\u2019re actually making her look less edgy.\n\nJLo says she \u201cnever got the groove all together.\u201d Harry says \u201cthe band was off.\u201d Keith wants her to \u201cuse the dynamics\u201d of a new setting.\n\n)\n\nC.J. Harris: \u201dCan\u2019t You See.\u201d This is easily C.J.\u2019s best performance in weeks. The song fits his voice perfectly. It also amps up his energy, grit and soul. He finally seems to have woken up after some off performances. Everything clicks into place.\n\nHarry says he\u2019s \u201cback to the forefront of the competition.\u201d Keith calls it \u201ckiller, man.\u201d JLo thinks he\u2019s \u201ca frontrunner, baby.\u201d\n\nDexter Roberts: \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d Dexter handles this song exactly the way I expect him to. It\u2019s a fine, serviceable, crowd-pleasing performance. He sings it well and seems comfortable. But it\u2019s just a bit safe and predictable. Nothing new or particularly creative or exciting about it. That\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not going to win a competition.\n\nKeith urges him to \u201cmake it individual.\u201d JLo says he\u2019s \u201cstarting to believe\u201d that he can win. Harry says he needs \u201cto be bigger than that song.\u201d\n\n)\n\nBen Briley: \u201cBennie and the Jets.\u201d WHAT. Ben is changing things up in a big way this week. Suit, slick hair and piano. I LIKE IT. Ben has been overlooked and underplayed in favor of C.J. and Dexter, and I\u2019m not sure why. He\u2019s an engaging performer and unique vocalist. He ably handles this Elton John classic, at least to these ears. It\u2019s a fun, frisky performance. I really am enjoying this.\n\nJLo doesn\u2019t think it \u201csuited who you are.\u201d UGH. Harry says \u201cit didn\u2019t feel like it had a purpose.\u201d WHATEVER. Keith \u201cis a little confused by it, too.\u201d HATERS.\n\n)\n\nMajesty Rose: \u201cLet It Go.\u201d I have lots of love for Majesty. I have lots of love for this song. I have lots of love for Idina Menzel. But it\u2019s just too big for Majesty. The lows are too low, and the highs are way too high. That money note is way off the mark. This song is about fragility, but it\u2019s also about power, and I don\u2019t think she capture all those moments. THAT SAID \u2014 I still think Majesty is an intriguing, interesting, engaging performer. She\u2019s one of the few people here who seems like a star.\n\nHarry calls it \u201ca strong performance.\u201d Keith says she has to \u201cease into it a little bit more.\u201d JLo loves her diversity.\n\n)\n\nCaleb Johnson: \u201cSkyfall.\u201d OK, I didn\u2019t get this at first. So I rewatched. Now I get it. Caleb absolutely knows his voice, probably more than anyone else this season. It\u2019s a theatrical, dramatic vocal but never veers into parody. And Caleb still manages to infuse it with his glam-rock spirit. Masterful in a lot of ways.\n\nKeith says it was \u201can amazing choice.\u201d JLo calls it \u201ca perfect song choice.\u201d Harry says he\u2019s \u201cgoing to be very hard to beat.\u201d\n\n)\n\nMK Nobillette: \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love.\u201d There are still some nerves and looks of awkwardness. But I think that\u2019s just going to be who MK is. Vocally, she\u2019s getting back on her game. It\u2019s a great choice for her tone and presence, and she locks into the quiet emotion. It\u2019s really just about confidence at this point.\n\nJLo compares her, vocally, to kd lang. Harry \u201cthought it was nice.\u201d Keith thinks she\u2019s \u201creally, really good.\u201d\n\nAlex Preston: \u201cFalling Slowly.\u201d Alex is at his best when he\u2019s putting his quirky acoustic spin on songs that are not normally quirky and acoustic. When he does something like this, which is already that, it\u2019s just OK. By no means terrible. But it should feel transcendent, and it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen these types of performances on here before.\n\nHarry calls it \u201csimply stated and elegantly done.\u201d Keith sees \u201ca raw fragility.\u201d JLo calls it \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\n)\n\nJena Irene: \u201cDecode.\u201d I love the tone of Jena\u2019s voice. She pulls me in from the first line. There\u2019s a Tori Amos vibe happening in there. which is a very good thing. Jena\u2019s voice pierces through the crashing arrangement.\n\nKeith calls it \u201cexhilarating.\u201d JLo thinks she has \u201cone of the best voices here\u201d and dubs it \u201cbest performance of the night.\u201d Harry says it was \u201cjust as good\u201d as the original.\n\nMalaya Watson: \u201cI Am Changing.\u201d Malaya goes big, and it mostly pays off. This isn\u2019t perfect. She overshoots some moments and wavers off key a few times. But it\u2019s really good, and the effort is what really drives it home. Malaya is fearless, and that\u2019s the mark of a star.\n\nJLo calls it \u201ckiller.\u201d Harry says it\u2019s a \u201cnice job.\u201d Keith says she\u2019s \u201cmagnificent.\u201d\n\nA good night overall, right? Here\u2019s where I stack them.\n\nJena Irene\n\nMalaya Watson\n\nCaleb Johnson\n\nC.J. Harris\n\nMK Nobillette\n\nAlex Preston\n\nBen Briley\n\nMajesty Rose\n\nDexter Roberts\n\nJessica Meuse\n\nSam Woolf\n\nI\u2019d expect Jessica, because the other girls are more memorable; and Ben, because the other guys are more memorable, to be in the bottom two. One of them will go home. The third person is a tough call, though I have a feeling it could be MK again. (Ugh.)\n\nSam is safe because the new voting system allows fans to cast ballots before someone performs, which is ridiculous. Things would likely be different if that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d airs at 7 p.m. Wednesdays and 8 p.m. Thursdays on Fox. And catch me recapping the night during the 5 p.m. news Thursdays and Fridays on Fox 26 Houston!\n\nNote: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post\u2019s poll.", "918": "American Idol headed to Tinseltown in Week 3, with the Top 11 choosing their favorite songs from movie soundtracks to perform.\n\nThis week is important because only the Top 10 finalists will be included on the Idol summer tour, meaning that ...\n\nAmerican Idol headed to Tinseltown in Week 3, with the Top 11 choosing their favorite songs from movie soundtracks to perform.\n\nThis week is important because only the Top 10 finalists will be included on the Idol summer tour, meaning that whoever gets eliminated Thursday will be left in the dust. Before the singing starts, however, Jennifer Lopez blinds us all with her matching hot pink shirt and pants set, and Harry Connick, Jr. threatens to adopt the Randy Jackson-patented \"in it to win it\" as his catch phrase. (Ed. Note: Please, no.)\n\nFor each contestant's intro package, the other 10 do their best impersonations of him or her. Unfortunately, the majority of these come off as odd and sometimes mean-spirited, rather than funny and entertaining. It also seems like they maybe don't know each other that well? In any case, it's uncomfortable - and makes us wonder how the contestants feel seeing the often-snarky comments right before they take the stage.\n\nAmerican Idol: Is this the most boring group of contestants ever?\n\nTo the performances!\n\nSamSong: \"Come Together\" by The BeatlesThe performance: We can't help but wonder why Sam opts to sit down for the first portion of the song rather than injecting a little life into it from the get-go. Ah, there's the answer: Sam couldn't look more uncomfortable trying to break out of his comfort zone and into rock territory. He has no inner rock star to channel, as evidenced by his awkward strutting. But, his voice is still great though, and he gets points for trying!What the judges say: Keith Urban compliments Sam on going for something new, but encourages him to loosen up even more. J.Lo asks for more personality and says Sam is at \"baby rock star\" level right now.\n\nJessicaSong: \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and GarfunkelThe performance: The first part of the performance is solid, but something gets screwed up with the timing once the drums come in, and it seems to throw Jessica for the remainder of the song. Her vocals on the second verse seem a little strained at times as well.What the judges say: Jennifer says it felt like Jessica never got into a groove with the song, but adds that she believes The Pink-Haired One could win the competition. Harry calls out the band for being off and praises Jessica for keeping her cool during the mishap. Keith encourages her to project more.\n\nHow the American Idol judges failed MK Nobilette\n\nC.J.Song: \"Can't You See\" by The Marshall Tucker BandThe performance: This is a great choice for C.J., who gives what is probably his strongest performance to date. There's plenty of big moments throughout, but he maintains control when dipping back into the softer lines as well.What the judges say: Harry says C.J. \"sang [his] way back to the forefront of the competition.\" Keith agrees that C.J. \"completely nailed it,\" and Jennifer practically leaps out of her chair at the end of the tune.\n\nDexterSong: \"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd SkynyrdThe performance: Aside from this song choice being completely boring and predictable, it does nothing to highlight Dexter's vocals or range. Unfortunately, this rendition doesn't set itself apart from any mediocre bar cover band version - let alone champ RubenStuddard's from Idol.What the judges say: Keith and Jen stick to critiquing Dexter's overall journey and persona. Harry compliments the performance as \"solid,\" but tells Dexter he needs to be \"bigger than the song\" if he's going to pick such a crowd-pleaser.\n\nBenSong: \"Bennie and the Jets\" by Elton JohnThe performance: Ben changes things up a little bit, sitting at the piano for the first part of the song before getting up to work the stage. The performance is a little too straightforward and snoozy for our liking (and pales compared to Haley Reinhart's version) but we can't fault Ben's vocals - and he demonstrates nice control on those high notes. It's a little too outside the box for the judges, though. Also ... 27 Dresses? Really?What the judges say: All three panelists say the performance was lacking, with Harry noting that it felt \"lackadaisical\" and \"pointless\" (ouch!). Keith and J.Lo say they're confused about who Ben is as an artist. Side note: Harry fiddling around on the piano for 10 seconds before the commercial break is the most interesting performance we've seen all season. And guess what? We'll see him perform full-out tomorrow night.\n\nIdol: Why we're just wild about Harry\n\nMajestySong: \"Let It Go\" by Idina MenzelThe performance: She's no Adele Dazeem, but Majesty tackles the Oscar-winning song from Frozen with an enthusiasm that unfortunately doesn't translate into technical proficiency. She misses quite a few notes and, after her \"Fix You\" debacle last week, definitely needs to find her range and comfort zone stat.What the judges say: Harry says Majesty may be spreading herself too thin, stylistically - and says if she's going to do so, she needs to be \"superb.\" Keith mostly talks about how much Nicole Kidman and their daughters like the movie, and J.Lo rambles on about her array of talents.\n\nCalebSong: \"Skyfall\" by AdeleThe performance: We have to admit, we didn't have high expectations for \"Skyfall,\" so props to Caleb for blowing those out of the water! The song is still yawn-worthy, but Caleb proves that he can handle a good ol' fashioned monster ballad just as well as a boot-stomping rocker.What the judges say: Keith is thrilled at the \"great, restrained\" effort, and Jennifer says this is the type of performance she's been waiting for. Even Harry says it's \"fantastic.\"\n\nAlt TV: 21 offbeat shows you should be watching\n\nMKSong: \"Make You Feel My Love\" by Garth BrooksThe performance: MK finally - finally! - starts to look like she's feeling comfortable on the stage, and even walks right up to the judges' table during this ballad. The price she pays (probably from nerves) is that some of the notes in the song are a little shaky (and also that horrible ensemble/makeover). But MK's biggest problem so far has been her demeanor, so we're confident the vocals will catch up.What the judges say: Jennifer loves the connection she was going for, while Harry tells her she needs to nail runs if she's going to attempt them. Keith says the performance offers \"glimpses\" of who she can be as an artist.\n\nAlexSong: \"Falling Slowly\" by Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1The performance: This is a great choice for Alex - we can wait another week for him to break free from his singer/songwriter shtick. He puts his own spin on the ballad, but brings it back home for the chorus. And the last note gets two thumbs up.What the judges say: Harry calls the performance simple yet elegant, and an emotional Keith compliments Alex's \"raw fragility.\" Jennifer says he sang it \"perfectly.\"\n\nJenaSong: \"Decode\" by ParamoreThe performance: This song is kind of a mess, but that has less to do with Jena's singing and more with what we assume is really poor sound mixing with the backing band. Jena turns in a worthy Hayley Williams imitation, and never veers off the rails though the vocals test her mettle. Also, the weekly reminder that Jena is just 17 is shocking every time.What the judges say: Keith loves Jena's \"ferocity,\" and Jennifer (who calls it the best performance of the night) says Jena was completely out of place in last week's bottom three.\n\nMalayaSong: \"I Am Changing\" by Jennifer HudsonThe performance: Malaya wisely opted not to do \"And I Am Telling You,\" instead going with this lesser-known song from Idol alum Hudson from Dreamgirls. It's a better performance than we're accustomed to from Malaya, with a few missteps here and there. We hate to think what would have happened to those big notes in less capable hands.What the judges say: She gets a standing ovation from Keith and Jennifer, and Harry tells Malaya that she may have cemented herself as the \"big belter\" of the group.\n\nWhat did you think of \"Music from the Movies\" night? Which were your favorite performances? Who will be in the bottom three? And Harry should definitely retire \"In it to win it,\" right?

Sounds good to me! A mellowed-out, less-Harsh Harry Connick Jr. wants to \u201craise this talent up as high as it can go.\u201d Or at least as high as the Hollywood sign, which is pretty freaking high. Here we go.\n\nOH NO. Harry\u2019s also on a raging \u201cin it to win it\u201d kick, likely because he recognizes how stupid Randy Jackson\u2019s former catchphrase is and wants to make fun of it. But nooooo, just stop saying it, ever.\n\nSam Woolf, The Beatles\u2019 \u201cCome Together\u201d from Across the Universe: \u201cI wanted to show a different side of me, so I chose an upbeat song,\u201d said the robot. (I loved the other singers being utterly confused when asked to mimic or even comment on any defining characteristic about Sam.) He finally moved around on the stage this time, while wearing the strangest shiny olive green blazer I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s possible I have only ever seen one. It looked like the underside of a portable picnic blanket I keep in my car. Or some sort of snazzy tent. And that\u2019s really all I remember from this first mediocre, or \u201cpretty average\u201d according to Harry, performance.\n\nHarry definitely toned down his \u201charsh\u201d (honest!) commentary this week. The Harry of last week would have asked Sam, \u201cWhat do you think that means \u2014 \u2018he shoot Coca-Cola?'\u201d and then maybe, \u201cYou\u2019re boring.\u201d But this week? \u201cYou have to make up for a simple melody with vibe\u201d and an encouraging followup, \u201cYou\u2019re on the way.\u201d\n\nJessica Meuse, Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d from The Graduate: The band messed up, but Jessica never seemed to recover, and I think she could have done a lot better. I want to like her so much, and I have a feeling I would LOVE hearing her regular set list in a smoky bar. But the Idol stage \u2014 where Coca-Cola isn\u2019t a drug, it\u2019s the sponsor \u2014 is no smoky bar. Totally different scene. Jess struggles with that. How could you not? If you\u2019re not a teenager, a cute boy, or consistently smiling your face off, you look weird up there. That\u2019s the reality of the show.\n\nJessica had some pretty good moments during her performance, though. Sometimes when she holds a strong note for awhile (and she\u2019s good at picking songs that let her do that) there\u2019s a potentially Stevie Nicks-esque richness to her vibrato that I find both soothing and haunting \u2014 one of my favorite musical combo platters. I know, I know, it\u2019s sacrilegious to compare these kids to full-blown icons \u2014 but sometimes it\u2019s just what comes out. (See below: J. Lo and M.K/k.d. lang. So many letters.) I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s as good, or close to as good. I\u2019m just wishfully thinking that a specific quality of her tone brings a famous person to mind. It happens.\n\nC.J. Harris, The Marshall Tucker Band\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t You See\u201d from Blow: C.J. saved up to buy a new guitar. Really? They can\u2019t just give him one? Budget. I thought this was his best performance yet, and it seemed Jennifer Lopez agreed as she shook her massive swirl of million-dollar horse hair while squinting to the beat. In fact, C.J.\u2019s storyline is being rewritten right this second. \u201cYou completely nailed it right then. Like, I know exactly who you are,\u201d raved Keith. \u201cYou can shock the world, change the world with your music. You have that ability. YOU\u2019RE A FRONTRUNNER, BABY!\u201d said Harry Connick Jr. Ha ha ha, just kidding, it was My Little Lo-ny.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call C.J.\u2019s song tide-shifting or anything, but he had a few clever little eyebrow raises to the camera on mentions of \u201cthat woman\u201d and spiced the original up with \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to Georgia, hey hey heyyyyyy.\u201d I also found it thrilling that thanks to the drive-in movie and urban-sprawl-at-night backdrop, C.J. appeared to be singing on the edge of a cliff. In a way, wasn\u2019t he? Aren\u2019t they all? One more step in the wrong direction and it\u2019s back to your hometown, kiddos.\n\nNote: C.J. was super funny in the contestants\u2019 \u201cAudition for the role of\u2026\u201d segments about each other. I liked how he put \u201cbananas and fruit\u201d in separate categories while characterizing Dexter. Someone likes bananas! Me too. Love \u2019em. So overall: a solid week for C.J. Harris.\n\nOh God, it\u2019s Randy Jackson puppeteered (?!) by Ryan Seacrest\u2019s arms. Dexter Roberts has ZERO time for this gross display of inadequate Dawg-training. What is Randy even doing there? Get back to the show.\n\nNEXT PAGE: Life is like a box of newborn puppies; you always know what you\u2019re gonna get", "920": "'America please get on board!'

Harris tested his chords on Can't You See from the Johnny Depp movie Blow.\n\nJ-Lo clapped and nodded in approval to his soulful version of The Marshall Tucker Band track.\n\n'You saw me, I was celebrating the whole time because I'm so proud of you,' she gushed.\n\nBlow song: C.J. Harris performed Can't You See from the film Blow and made himself a front-runner in the competition\n\n'I think you just sang your way back to the forefront of this competition,' said Connick, while Urban called it 'killer'.\n\nFarmer and dog trainer Dexter Roberts, 22, sang for his roots with Sweet Home Alabama.\n\n'Loving the haircut man,' said Urban, noting his new quaff, but told him he needed to personalise his showmanship.\n\nLopez thought his performance was also lacking in 'personality'.\n\nNice haircut: Dexter Roberts belted out Sweet Home Alabama and was complimented by Keith on his haircut\n\nBen Briley tried out a track from the British master Sir Elton John.\n\nThe bearded singer's rendition of Bennie And The Jets from the romantic comedy 27 Dresses left a general feeing of confusion among the judges.\n\n'I'm not sure who you are as an artist yet,' said Connick, who also asked him to 'pound the piano' harder and not be so lackadaisical.\n\nLopez liked the vocals, but didn't feel that it suited his country vibe.\n\nRomantic comedy: Ben Briley sang Bennie And The Jets from the romantic comedy 27 Dresses\n\nMajesty Rose impressed the panel with the Oscar-winning track Let It Go from Frozen.\n\n'It could have been written for me,' said the cheerful 21-year-old from North Carolina.\n\n'My wife and daughters will be loving that song at home,' said Urban, 46, who is married to Nicole Kidman.\n\n'I think you can do anything,' said J-Lo, noting the singer's immense versatility.\n\nNailed it: Majesty Rose impressed the audience and judges singing Let It Go from Frozen\n\nHard rocker Caleb Johnson belted out the Adele song Skyfall from the James Bond film of the same name.\n\n'This is what I've been waiting for, I loved that, it took us away from the rock thing but it was still you,' remarked Lopez.\n\n'That was fantastic. You're going to be very hard to beat,' Connick told the 22-year-old.\n\nTook a chance: Caleb Johnson departed from his rocker style and chose Skyfall by Adele\n\nMK Nobilette, the first openly gay Idol contestant, chose a track from the Connick romcom Hope Floats.\n\n'Dancing is just a conversation between two people, so talk to me,' joked Ryan Seacrest, quoting one of Connick's lines.\n\nWearing a glittery suit MK got the audience swaying to Make You Feel My Love.\n\nLopez compared her to KD Lang while Connick was approving but criticised her runs.\n\nSweet voice: MK Nobilette didn't move around a lot but her voice alone won over J-LO\n\nAlternative music fan Alex Preston raised the roof with Falling Slowly from the movie Once.\n\nConnick appreciated his 'elegant' execution while Urban called it 'raw'.\n\n'That really held my attention\u2026I really love your artistry man,' he said.\n\n'It was a perfect song and you sang it perfectly\u2026beautiful,' sniffed Lopez.\n\nFeeling it: Alex Preston gave a heartfelt rendition of Falling Slowly from Once\n\nLast to hit the Hollywood stage was excitable Detroit girl Malaya Watson.\n\nThe 16-year-old student gave a solid performance of Jennifer Hudson's I Am Changing from Dreamgirls.\n\n'Yes, good girl\u2026a perfect way to end the show,' said Lopez, while Connick called her 'the big belter' of the contest.\n\nStrong finish: Malaya Watson ended the show with a powerful take on I Am Changing from Dreamgirls\n\nBackstage the contestants had a chance to rib each other with impressions. This led to much hilarity about Jessica Meuse's hometown of Slapout in Alabama.\n\nDexter Roberts got a teasing for his straw-chewing country attitude and Caleb Johnson was named as the secret lovechild of Jack Black and Meatloaf.\n\nOne contestant will be eliminated on Thursday after the public vote.", "921": "Game on.\n\nAfter a few lackluster live shows, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d top 11 finalists broke out the big guns Wednesday night, delivering a cluster of sensational, stand-out performances.\n\nFor the first time, season 13 feels like a spirited competition, with each performer working hard now to choose songs that play to their strengths, all the while building a star-caliber stage presence to keep America voting.\n\nSpecifically, two songs from musicals, alongside a \u201cTwilight\u201d track really stole the show in \u201cSongs from the Cinema\u201d week, but top-to-bottom, most everyone had a strong outing.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss:\n\nTHE BREAKDOWN\n\nSam Woolf singing \u201cCome Together\u201d by The Beatles\n\nThe girls are going to scream for Sam no matter what he does, but from a more unbiased opinion, this was nothing special. It was good for Sam to try a more upbeat song without his guitar, but he\u2019s so awkward up there, it was at times difficult to focus on his singing. Keith said Sam needed to loosen up more, and J-Lo called him \u201cbaby rock star.\u201d\n\nJessica Meuse singing \u201cThe Sound of Silence\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel\n\n\n\nThis was definitely Jessica\u2019s best live performance so far. She seemed more comfortable with the song, and more engaging, despite falling behind the music at one point. It still felt a little like a \u201cbar show,\u201d but with Jessica, it seems this is about as good as it\u2019s going to get. \u201cDo you think you can win?\u201d J-Lo asked. Jessica said \u201cyes.\u201d The rest of us aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nCJ Harris singing \u201cCan\u2019t You See\u201d by Marshall Tucker Band\n\nGreat choice by CJ to sing the southern rock classic. The grit in his voice complimented the tune wonderfully and for the first time in a while, his pitch matched his passionate, heart-on-the-sleeve style. Everything fell into place this time around and CJ should be proud of himself. Keith gave him a standing ovation. \u201cYou just sung your way back to the forefront of this competition,\u201d Harry said.\n\nDexter Roberts singing \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nNot much to say about this one. It was a well-sung, predictable song choice from the \u2018Bama boy. It won\u2019t help him much in the competition, but shouldn\u2019t hurt him either. Keith told him to individualize his song choices. \u201cYou have to be bigger than that song,\u201d Harry\n\nadded.\n\nBen Briley singing \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d by Elton John\n\nAn odd choice from Ben, who cleaned up, took off his hat and played some keys for the first half of the song, which fell somewhere between a solid cover and a mockery. There were some pitch problems, but the biggest issue came when he tried falsetto for the last verse and his voice never quite got there. \u201cIt felt like a lackadaisical walk through the song,\u201d Harry said.\n\nMajesty Rose singing \u201cLet It Go\u201d by Idina Menzel\n\nNot to be mean, but this was terrible. Majesty never came close to the power needed for this song, and although she deserves a little credit for taking on the big song, she was completely over-matched. This wouldn\u2019t have gotten her through auditions. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t send her home. She\u2019s better than this. \u201cYou need to ease in a little more,\u201d Keith said.\n\nCaleb Johnson singing \u201cSkyfall\u201d by Adele\n\nGood for Caleb getting away from rock for the night, and for the most part, this epic cover did the trick. There were a few hiccups, but his voice fit the song pretty well and he used every molecule of his powerful chops to hit those high notes. \u201cThat was fantastic,\u201d Harry said.\n\nMK Nobillette singing \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201d by Bob Dylan\n\nStill a little stiff, but a very nice vocal from MK. The sweet song fell right in her wheelhouse and she showed more range than she has in past weeks, but she continues to have confidence issues on stage. She always seems like she can\u2019t wait for the performance to be finished. The judges seemed to like it though, calling her \u201csubtle\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nAlex Preston singing \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d by Glen Hansard\n\nFantastic showing from Alex, who completely transformed the rather simple tune into this superb arrangement that allowed him to shine on notes both big and small. He really nailed the money note at the end, and the whole performance was can\u2019t-look-away good. Harry called it \u201csimply stated and elegantly done.\u201d\n\nJena Irene singing \u201cDecode\u201d by Paramore\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but still a very confident, powerful performance from Jena. The song choice, and the key were both smart choices, giving way to Jena\u2019s big, belting notes, which seem more effortless for her than any of the other contestants. Some of her runs were a little messy, but overall, a strong showing for sure. \u201cThere\u2019s a ferocity about the way you perform,\u201d Keith said.\n\nMalaya Watson singing \u201cI Am Changing\u201d by Jennifer Hudson\n\n\n\nMalaya\u2019s rousing performance of the \u201cDreamgirls\u201d tune closed the show on an emphatic note. At only 16, this girl can really show off, and although she doesn\u2019t have the same range Jennifer Hudson does, Malaya still gave arguably her best outing so far. Keith and J-Lo stood up for it. \u201cThe song was perfect to play to your strengths,\u201d Keith said.\n\nPOWER RANKING\n\n1. Alex Preston\n\n2. Jena Irene\n\n3. Malaya Watson\n\n4. CJ Harris\n\n5.

She\u2019s been the most consistent contestant so far, and this was a huge week for her.\n\n\u2022 I was happy to see CJ have such a great week and show that he does belong in the top 10. For a while he was looking pretty shaky.\n\n\u2022 The \u201cIdols making fun of each other\u201d gags before each performance were a little lame, but still silly and most of all, very accurate. The Malaya impressions were the best.\n\nBut this is just my rambling. What did you think? Comment below.", "922": "Viewers might have been tempted to break out the popcorn tonight as the top 11 singers performed on \"American Idol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nC.J. Harris of Jasper is among three Alabamians who've survived previous cuts on the show. On this occasion, Harris went straight to his roots, selecting a tune that combines Southern rock, blues and country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the latest on Harris, 23, as seen on the 7 p.m. broadcast.\n\n\n\nThis week's theme: Music from films. Contestants picked songs that reflect \"the soundtrack of their lives.\"\n\nWhat he sang: \"Can't You See\" by \"Can't You See\" by Marshall Tucker Band . It was featured in 2001's \"Blow.\"\n\nWhat Harris said: He's extremely familiar with the song, after performing it for five or six years. Harris cradled a new guitar during his chat with \"Idol\" host Ryan Seacrest, and proclaimed himself blessed to be there.\n\n\n\nWhat the judges said: Universal praise from Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban and Jennifer Lopez. \"I think you just picked and sang your way back to the forefront of this competition,\" Connick said. \"That was very, very strong. Nice job.\" Urban called the performance \"killer, man\" and said Harris nailed every note. From Lopez: \"You're the front-runner, baby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical reaction: Rough-edged and raspy, imbued with real-deal emotion. Harris played to his strengths this week, choosing a song that suits him perfectly. Resurrecting the Marshall Tucker Band, circa 1973? Could have been a disaster, but Harris' version of the vintage tune came out soulful and cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next: Viewers will vote for their favorites in several ways, including a new method linked to Google searches. One singer will be eliminated on the March 13 episode, which airs at 8 p.m. CST. Connick and Mali Music will perform on the results show.\n\nYep, it was movie night. Contestants on the Fox reality series were asked to present material that's been featured on the silver screen, choosing songs that suit their personalities and backgrounds. Fingers were crossed for something more compelling than \"A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme),\" and this year's group of hopefuls delivered, covering tunes that ranged from \"Decode\" to \"Bennie and the Jets.\"", "923": "The top 11 contestants looked to the silver screen tonight on \"American Idol,\" covering songs from movie soundtracks. In the past, this theme hasn't been very successful on the Fox reality series -- many singers went no further than shallow Disney hits -- but the current crop of hopefuls came up with some interesting choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nJess Meuse of Slapout is one of three Alabamians left in the competition during Season 13. The rock singer-songwriter took the film challenge seriously, transforming a wistful ballad that harks back to the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the latest on the Meuse , 23, as seen on the 7 p.m. broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week's theme: Music from the movies. Contestants chose songs that reflect \"the soundtrack of their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Meuse said: \"It's a really deep and introspective song.\" Meuse says she's been playing \"The Sound of Silence\" regularly in nightclubs; it's been a staple of her setlists for some time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the judges said: Reactions were mixed among Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick Jr. Lopez said Meuse never found her groove. (\"We should have been blown away, but I wasn't.\") Connick praised Meuse for staying focused when the band's arrangement -- oddly timed and distracting -- could have thrown her off. Urban encouraged her to use the microphone with more subtlety, playing off \"the quietness of the room.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical reaction: Meuse's rendition was compelling, with a twangy vibrato and stylized phrasing. She plugged into the emotions of the ballad, giving the lyrics a muscular heft. This was quite different from the ethereal treatment made famous by Simon & Garfunkel, but the twist worked for her. The \"Idol\" backing band was no help, though. Why not try an a cappella version?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next: Viewers will vote for their favorites in several ways, including a new method linked to Google searches. One singer will be eliminated on the March 13 episode, which airs at 8 p.m. CST. Connick and Mali Music will perform on the results show.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's at stake: Singers who make the top 10 will travel on the \"American Idol\" tour this summer. It's a step toward a major-league career, a way to make some money and an opportunity to continue momentum built on the show.", "924": "In keeping with the theme of giving contestants non-musical genre choices week to week and freeing them up to make their decisions feel a little more natural, the American Idol Top 11 will be singing songs from their favorite movies tonight.\n\nThe stakes tonight are high because those who remain after tomorrow night's results show will earn a spot on the Idol summer tour.\n\nWill MK Nobilette bring it tonight and get herself out of the bottom tomorrow? Will Dexter Roberts find a way to make his movie song his own?\n\nLet's find out...\n\nSam Woolf is up first tonight singing \"Come Together\" by The Beatles from the film Across the Universe. He drops the guitar this week and bobbles a note in the first verse. He's sitting on crates sort of jamming with his upper body while he...oh look! He stood up! He's working the stage a little bit but he is so painfully awkward despite having a ton of talent and star appeal and much of that comes from age. He has the potential to really blossom as an artist if he can break out of his shell a little. Vocally this is decent but not spectacular.\n\nKeith loved that he was trying to loosen up. Jennifer tells him he needs to know that the girls like him and calls it a nice start to the night. Harry thinks he's on the way to where he needs to be but called it an average performance. 3.5/5\n\nFrom Slapout, Alabama, Jessica Meuse chose \"The Sound of Silence\" from The Graduate. She gets more and more hair every week, first of all, but I really like what the stylists are doing with her look. Second of all, she has this weird vibrato in her voice that can be cool sometimes but can also be overkill. That was sort of an odd performance for me. She never had a moment and settled into the song.\n\nJennifer said it seemed like the perfect song for her but she felt like Jessica never got her groove. Harry says the band was off but Jessica kept her focus and thought she did a nice job. Keith tells her to work on using the dynamics of the microphone instead of singing like she's still in a bar. 3.5/5\n\nC.J. Harris chose \"Can't You See\" by the Marshall Tucker Band from the movie Blow. I'm really sad he didn't choose something from Indiana Jones given that hat he keeps wearing. I'm hooked from the first note and really hoping for this to be his moment to win me over. I want him to stop trying to have eyesex with the cameras because it's weird, but this is actually fantastic. WELL DONE, CJ!\n\nKeith gives him a standing ovation and Harry kicks off the critique saying that he \"picked and sang his way back to the forefront of this competition.\" Keith called it killer and said he completely nailed it. Jennifer loved it and called him a frontrunner. 5/5\n\nIn a choice that shocks no one, Dexter Roberts chooses \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" The trouble about choosing this song is that it's been covered and covered and covered again so if yours doesn't absolutely ROCK it sounds like a cheap imitation. Dexter loses the hat and picks up an electric guitar and it still sounds a little karaoke. I really, really like Dexter and want him to do well but week to week he's underwhelming.\n\nKeith thinks he's starting to loosen up and really sing but what he has to work on is making the song his own. (Thank you, Keith!!) Jennifer says he needs to put his own personality into the performance but thinks he's starting to believe that he can do this. Harry calls him really smart for choosing a song everyone knows but says he needed to be bigger than the song. 3/5\n\nBen Briley has ditched his baseball hat and donned a suit to sing Elton John's \"Bennie and the Jets\" from 27 Dresses, which he has never seen. He shows his musicality by sitting behind the piano for the performance like Sir Elton himself. He's incredibly clean cut this week which is a nice change. Halfway through he gets up from the piano stool to move around the stage a little and it's nice to see him working the stage. He does NOT have the falsetto for this song at all. I give him props for trying but that was awkward.\n\nJennifer looks confused when he finishes and it's her turn to start talking. She thinks he's trying to figure himself out a little bit and liked his vocal performance but didn't think it was a good song choice. Harry felt like he lacked purpose and says he doesn't know if we've ever heard the real Ben. Keith said he misses Ben's authenticity from his auditions and doesn't know who Ben is as an artist. 3/5\n\nMajesty Rose says \"Let It Go\" should have been written for her. She starts in her lower register and it's hard to hear her. This song is difficult to sing right now because it's everywhere and this arrangement is TERRIBLE. It's all chopped to pieces to fit her given time so instead of building to the bridge she has to jump straight into it. Her voice strains and cracks and I really wanted her to do well, but it wasn't spectacular. It wasn't terrible. It just wasn't what it could have been.\n\nHarry calls her a mystery and says that he's starting to lose sight of who she is but thought this was a strong performance. Keith thought most of it was really good but thinks that it might not have translated to those of us watching from home. Jennifer thinks she has potential as an animated film voice actress but can be anything she wants to be. 3.5/5\n\nResident rocker Caleb Johnson is singing \"Skyfall\" from Skyfall. This is definitely starting out as a much different performance for him. It's way more subdued than we're used to and I feel the renewed sense of wanting him to 1) shave or 2) cut his hair. I really like what he's doing here. The song shows his range and allows him to be a little more dramatic than usual (instead of his usual theatrical approach).\n\nKeith thought the performance was completely unpredictable and loved that Caleb showed restraint and power. Jennifer said this is what she's been waiting for. As far as Harry's concerned, the competition started tonight. 4.5/5\n\nMK Nobilette\u200b is rocking the blonde hair and sequined jacket to sing \"Make You Feel My Love\" from Hope Floats. I'm hooked from the opening line. This song is PERFECT for her voice and this might have just become my favorite version of this song. she does lack a little in charisma on the stage, like she's not quite pouring her entire heart into it or is just too much in her head when she sings, but vocally that was the best of the night.\n\nJennifer said MK put us all in a great place and compares her to kd lang. There's a \"beautiful subtlety\" to what MK does. Harry likes seeing MK's name on a marquee because she does have star quality but cautions her to nail the runs if she's going to sing them. Keith thought the performance was amazing but wants her to lose herself in her songs more often. 5/5\n\nAlex Preston dons a white jacket for \"Falling Slowly.\" I'm sort of captivated from the beginning and find myself wishing I knew this song so I could sing along with him. I can barely critique this because I'm just so...sucked in. The song feels so pure. He does a fantastic job showing his range in the song and then ends on this really great moment. Wow. I really loved that.\n\nHarry loves that there's a platform for a guy to sing a simple song in an elegant manner and says he's really proud of Alex. Keith loved that the performance held his attention and called it \"raw and fragile.\" Alex is always in the moment and authentic. Jennifer just says \"beautiful.\" 5/5\n\nFrom Twilight, Jena Irene chose \"Decode.\" She gets behind the piano, which is where the judges (and I) like her most. This girl has a set of pipes on her that are unparalleled in this competition. At only 17, she definitely has a long career ahead of her if she chooses to pursue music no matter what happens this season. This is her best moment on Idol so far and clearly the best of the night. If I could give her more than 5 I would.\n\nKeith says he loves what Jena does when she performs calling it \"exhilarating.\" Jennifer calls her \"the real thing\" and doesn't know what she was doing in the bottom 3 last week. Harry called her performance different and \"just as good\" as the original. 5/5\n\nClosing out the night, Malaya Watson is channeling her inner diva for \"I Am Changing\" from Dreamgirls. This is the song she says made her want to pursue music. When Malaya sings it's hard to remember she's only 16 because her voice and personality are just so big. She struggles a little on the lower notes, but she shines when she opens up. She gets a standing ovation from Keith and Jennifer.\n\nJennifer starts the critique saying that was a perfect song choice and a perfect song for her. Harry looks forward to watching her blossom as a star for years to come. Keith compliments her for knowing what songs play to her strengths and cautions her not to get caught up in the adrenaline of performing while acknowledging that it happens. 5/5\n\nTonight was an odd night of Idol. It didn't exactly get off to a strong start, which sort of had me thinking that the night would be a dud (like last week). I'm happy to report that we were all proven wrong with the last few performers to take the stage.\n\nC.J. Harris, MK Nobillette, Alex Preston, Jena Irene, and Malaya Watson share my prize for best of the night. If MK and Malaya end up in the Bottom 3 tonight, I will have to question just what, exactly America is thinking. There's no way any of those 5 should go home or even be afraid of leaving tomorrow. At all.\n\nAs for who might leave tomorrow, Ben Briley could find himself in danger. His performance didn't really connect for me. Dexter Roberts and Jessica Meuse join him in my bottom 3. Dexter's trouble is that there's nothing about his performances that make him sound original. Jessica comes off as disconnected and, quite frankly, like she thinks she's better than she is. Yes, confidence is a great thing, but there comes a point when confidence turns to cockiness and \"I'm not listening to what you say\" starts to radiate and that's where she is right now for me.\n\nWhat did you think about tonight's American Idol?

He ditched the guitar and picked a song a little more upbeat, but overall, it was just OK. There were no big moments in the song and he didn\u2019t really seem to be totally comfortable. It\u2019s definitely not his best effort. Performance Grade: B\n\nJessica Meuse, \u201cThe Sound of Silence.\u201d Great, great song choice. And her vocals were great. The overall performance wasn\u2019t existing or anything, but it was nice and moody. But it was sort of just sitting there. I think like Jennifer said, something was off, but it was still a pretty solid effort. Performance Grade: B+\n\nC.J. Harris, \u201cCan\u2019t You See.\u201d This is another good song choice. Not only is it a good song, but it really worked for him. It was his best performance in my opinion. His vocals were spot on and he was connected. He also made the song his own. I really liked the arrangement and the spins he put on it. Performance Grade: A\n\nDexter Roberts, \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d This song choice makes a lot of sense for him. I\u2019m pleased with the song choices tonight. He handled the song pretty well, but I found it boring. I mean there were no technical issues or anything, but it was just OK. Performance Grade: B+\n\nBen Briley, \u201cBenny & The Jets.\u201d Eh. That piano playing was a bit harsh and the tempo was weird. And the vocals were OK at best. It\u2019s a good song, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right singer to do a stripped down version. Thankfully the band broke in later. It all got better then, but it was still not that great. Performance Grade: C+\n\nMajesty Rose, \u201cLet It Go.\u201d I didn\u2019t expect to hear such a new song. And I wish she\u2019d picked something else. It just wasn\u2019t good. There were a few good moments, but there were a lot of bad moments. Performance Grade: C+\n\nCaleb Johnson, \u201cSkyfall.\u201d Well this isn\u2019t the person I expected to cover Adele, but OK. Let\u2019s see how it goes. He picked the right kind of song. He did need to pull back this week. So he picked a more mellow song, but still delivered the powerful big vocals. It was pretty solid. Performance Grade: A-\n\nMK Nobilette, \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love.\u201d Every single performance of hers is the same. It\u2019s always mellow and in the same key and she\u2019s usually on a stool. This performance was actually more connected than her previous ones, but I think it might be too late for her. It wasn\u2019t bad, though. Performance Grade: B\n\nAlex Preston, \u201cFalling Slowly.\u201d Well this is the third time this song has been done on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Which is way too much. I think it\u2019s a great song, though. But Alex\u2019s version was weird and almost unrecognizable. I hated it. Performance Grade: C\n\nJena Irene, \u201cDecode.\u201d What is this song? Why? Ugh. It was nice to see her back at the piano. I don\u2019t know the song, but it was perfect for her. She sounded amazing. Her vocals were perfect and she didn\u2019t miss a beat with the song\u2019s intensity and emotion. Performance Grade: A+\n\nMalaya Watson, \u201cI Am Changing.\u201d This was the perfect song for her. This is the kind of song that just really fits for her. She had a few iffy moments, but the vocals were big and it all really worked for her. That ending note alone is enough for an A. Performace Grade: A-\n\nWhat did you think of the American Idol 2014 Top 11 performances?", "926": "Our beloved Deirdre linked to TV Line's \"Reality Check\" with Melinda Doolittle (season 6) and the incomparable Michael Slezak where they discuss what we are seeing: great judging, bad mentoring.\n\nMaybe \"Idol\" should have made Harry Connick Jr. the full-time mentor and just find someone else as the judge. (No Randy Jackson, please!).\n\nHowever charming he is on the dais, these kids really need help on stage. They seem to be having trouble with song choice, arrangements, keys, you name it. Yet I still feel like there's enough talent there to salvage the season. They noted how Connick said he wishes in some ways he COULD mentor the contestants behind the scenes, rather than just have a few seconds to critique them in front of the world. He clearly cares enough that he would and could spend plenty of time with them maximizing their performances and as Slezak said, he was in effect throwing shade at Jackson for his mentoring (or lack thereof.). That seems to be a reasonable conjecture given how little mentoring we've actually seen from said Jackson.\n\nAnyway, the top 11 did generally do better tonight picking songs from films, giving us some hope this group isn't hopeless. And the judges (especially Keith this week for Jessica) provided some good advice.\n\nThe three best performances: Caleb Johnson pulled back on his cliche rock thing and did an intense Adele song intensely. Jena Irene took a tough song and brought it home. C.J. Harris has been underwhelming for weeks but finally found his comfort zone with Marshall Tucker. Was someone (gasp!) mentoring him properly?\n\nThere was only a single disastrous performance: Ben Briley's perplexing rendition of a lounge singer. It may even place him in the bottom three. But will he go home for it? Tough call. He should go home, I fathom.\n\nNone of the ladies did anything so awful to deserve missing the tour though several were just so so. Majesty Rose has been a favorite for weeks so a subpar performance shouldn't drop her to the bottom. MK Nobillette is just waiting for her elimination at some point. Often times, when someone like that does a passable job, that virtually guarantees their trip home because their few fans will get complacent. Jessica Meuse disappointed yet again. When she should have hit a home run on a fat fastball, she merely rapped a single.\n\nI don't know if Malaya Watson being placed in the pimp spot will prevent her from being in the bottom three. Sam Woolf still hasn't really found his footing on the live stage but he is getting better and progress is better than regression. Dexter Roberts was merely adequate with a crowd pleaser which Harry Connick Jr. noted is probably good enough for him. Alex Preston did his quirky singer-songwriter thing again and did it well.\n\nSo my bottom three are Malaya, MK and Ben. I predict MK will go home.\n\nMy rank of the 11: 1. C.J. 2. Caleb 3. Jena 4. Alex 5. Sam 6. MK 7. Majesty 8. Malaya 9. Dexter 10. Jessica 11. Ben\n\nRandom trivia: season 8 winner Kris Allen sang three of tonight's songs on \"Idol\": \"Come Together,\" \"Make You Feel My Love\" and \"Falling Slowly.\"\n\nHere are quick takes on the performances, in order:\n\nSam Woolf (\"Come Together\" Beatles from \"Across the Universe\") - He has been very stiff so he goes for a more upbeat song and he sounds great. He is still stiff, with some improvement. Both Keith and J. Lo note the improvement. She wishes he had put more bite into it. HCJ said it was an average performance that was \"pretty good.\" Grade: B/B-plus\n\nJessica Meuse (\"Sounds of Silence\" Simon & Garfunkel from \"The Graduate\") - She has sung this song a million times so she should be able to rock it. I think she is trying to be solemn but looks oddly disconnected. It's a passable vocal but not a bracing performance like it could be. Something is missing, unfortunately. J. Lo said it should be the perfect song for her moodwise but felt something wasn't right. HCJ blamed the band as \"off.\" Keith says in small joints you have to sing close to the mic but here she has to use the dynamics of the room better. \"You're in a different environment,\" he says. Grade: B/B-minus\n\nC.J. Harris (\"Can't You See\" Marshall Tucker Band from \"Blow\") - He finally found a song that really highlights his voice. It's bluesy and soulful and he finally looks comfortable on the big stage. He got Keith Urban to give him a proper standing ovation. HCJ said he placed himself back to the \"forefront\" of this competition. Keith said \"it was killer... I know exactly who you are.\" Grade: A\n\nDexter Roberts (\"Sweet Home Alabama\" Lynyrd Skynyrd) - He sings it with a pleasant demeanor and even threw in \"roll Tide roll.\" Again, he is an awesome bar band singer. As for \"Idol\"? Unmemorable. Yet again, Keith said he needs to make it sound more distinctive. HCJ said his objective is to win the competition and he said it was good but \"you have to be bigger than that song.\" He was not bigger than that song. Grade: B\n\nBen Briley (\"Bennie and the Jets\" Elton John from \"27 Dresses\") - I never particularly liked this song. He is singing this like a lounge singer. What is up with that? Bizarro! J. Lo contorted herself not to be too insulting but you could tell she wasn't buying it. HCJ said you have to pound the piano but it felt like a lackadaisical walk through the song and had no purpose. \"Pointless,\" he said. Grade: C\n\nMajesty Rose (\"Let It Go\" Idina Mendez \"Frozen\") - I know this is a huge song from \"Frozen\" but having not seen \"Frozen\" and not having young kids, I'm not terribly familiar. It seems to have standard Disney tropes. I hated her dress but her performance seemed very respectful. She seems to be swallowed up by the song for some reason. HCJ said she is spreading herself stylistically thin. But tonight, she did a good job. Keith said it's a tough song that was written for her but felt she attacked it too much. Grade: B/B-plus\n\nCaleb Johnson (\"Skyfall\" Adele from \"Skyfall\") - He picked a song I thought Majesty would have sung. But it was smart. It took him away from rock but he brought strength and confidence and resonance to the song that was not an imitation of Adele. Keith said it wasn't predictable but dependable. \"An amazing choice and great restrained performance. Great power.\" HCJ said he is proof he thinks this is the best top 13 ever. (I don't but alas...) Grade: A/A-minus\n\nMK Nobillette (\"Make You Feel My Love\" Bob Dylan/Billy Joel/Garth Brooks) - That was the best we've heard in awhile. I tried not to watch her because honestly, seeing her blank face kind of ruins the effect. J. Lo compared her to k.d. Lang. HCJ says she has star quality when she focuses it and owns it. He wishes she had cut the runs by 50-75 percent. Keith says she looks like a star. Grade: B-plus\n\nAlex Preston (\"Falling Slowly\" Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova from \"Once\") - He is like the next lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls. Very emotive but doesn't over do it. HCJ says he likes that Preston did it simply and elegantly. Keith: It held his attention. \"Raw fragility\" in the most complimentary way. \"Authenticity\" and \"artistry\" bonus points. J. Lo said it was perfect. Grade: B-plus\n\nJena Irene Asciutto (\"Decode\" Paramore from \"Twilight\") - I am not familiar with this song, proving how out of that teen demo I'm not in anymore since I've never seen \"Twilight.\" But honestly, I liked it. It felt like she was in her element. She brought a lot of \"ferocity\" to it, as Keith said. HCJ said it was different and just as good as the original. Grade: B-plus/A-minus\n\nMalaya Watson in the pimp spot! (\"I Am Changing\" Beyonce from \"Dreamgirls\") - She has the tone and the volume but lacks the depth in her voice.. I think she simply isn't ready for primetime. I would love to hear her in five years. This song proves that she is on the right path but she's not there yet. Keith said she knows songs that play to her strengths. He feels she can rein it in at times and gets caught up. Grade: B/B-plus", "927": "We are desperate to hear some big WOW moments on the American Idol 2014 Top 11 performances show tonight. We don\u2019t have any American Idol spoilers on what the finalists will be singing this evening. However, we\u2019re hoping the song theme for this week will give the contestants plenty of opportunities to impress us and American Idol judges Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer Lopez, and Keith Urban.\n\nOur original American Idol 2014 spoilers had the song theme for this week listed as \u201cSongs From the Cinema.\u201d However, we\u2019ve also heard tonight\u2019s theme referenced as \u201cSoundtrack of Our Lives.\u201d Either way, there should be tons of songs for the American Idol Top 11 to perform that will truly show off their diverse vocal styles and abilities. Well, we hope so anyway.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t agree with TV Guide when they say this is the \u201cmost boring\u201d group of American Idol finalists ever (we give that to season 9), the contestants really, really need to step it up this week. Last week\u2019s American Idol performances show was a bomb, and only a couple of the singers managed to pull off a decent showing \u2014 and even those were not standing ovation material.\n\nWe kick off tonight with a video montage of the American Idol Top 11 and it\u2019s all about giving it your all tonight because it\u2019s getting serious. Then we have our typical intro of the finalists and the American Idol judges, and a bit about this evening\u2019s show, which is all about \u201cSongs From the Cinema.\u201d The song choice has to be from a movie soundtrack.\n\nJennifer Lopez is actually wearing full clothes tonight (mostly) but her dress is such a bright shade of hot pink it is hard not to be blinded.\n\nWhichever contestants survive this week will get to go on the American Idol Live Tour this summer, which means cash, promo deals, and lots more face time in front of the fans. Everyone is wanting that for sure!\n\nA bit of chatter from the American Idol 2014 judges about what the contestants needed to do to prepare this week. And then it\u2019s time to get going with the performances!\n\nAmerican Idol Top 11 Performances:\n\nSam Woolf: \u201cCome Together\u201d by The Beatles from Sgt Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band\n\nThis is one of those songs you feel like the singer needs to have really lived to sing it with the pain and passion it needs. Sam has decent vocals on the song, but we just aren\u2019t feeling it in our guts. And with this song, you have to feel it deep in your gut like it is grabbing you and yanking you around. We also aren\u2019t feeling the t-shirt and shiny blazer with this song. So not the right visual.\n\nThe American Idol judges are so-so about it. They don\u2019t think they pushed it enough and harry called it an \u201caverage performance\u201d and a \u201cpretty good job. We agree.\n\nVote Sam Woolf: Text 12 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-12 (1-855-443-6512)\n\nJessica Meuse: \u201cSound Of Silence\u201d by Simon and Garfunkle from The Graduate\n\nWe love this song, but Jessica is sounding a little sharp and flat on it. Although it is hard to tell because this song is a little odd that way anyway. Still, it\u2019s not really what we wanted tonight. We wanted to hear something rocking and powerful. Instead, we get a song that is too nasal, too quiet, and doesn\u2019t really show off her vocals to best effect. (Ryan notes after the performance that the band was actually off with Jess for a moment or two.)\n\nThe American Idol judges seem to agree that it wasn\u2019t the most stellar performance. J-Lo says it seems \u201clike the perfect song\u201d but she felt like Jessica just never got her \u201cgroove on.\u201d Harry likes it more, although we feel like he gave some backhanded compliments. Keith tells Jess she needs to be more dynamic and think about how she is using the mic in a very different environment than she is used to.\n\nVote Jessica Meuse: Text 10 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-10 (1-855-443-6510)\n\nCJ Harris: \u201cCan\u2019t You See\u201d by Marshall Tucker Band from Blow\n\nThis is exactly the right kind of song for CJ. We wouldn\u2019t say it is one of the very best performances on the show ever, but it\u2019s a really strong song for CJ. He shines and we remember why he is in the Top 11 in the first place.\n\nAll of the American Idol judges are loving it. Harry says CJ is back in the competition, and J-Lo says this song makes him a front-runner. Harry says it doesn\u2019t even matter that he was a bit sharp, because he could feel the performance and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nVote CJ Harris: Text 5 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-05 (1-855-443-6505)\n\nDexter Roberts: \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d by Lynyrd Skynyrd from Sweet Home Alabama\n\nIn what is probably the most obvious song choice ever, Dexter Roberts takes on the unofficial anthem of his home state of Alabama. Not a bad idea considering it\u2019s totally in his wheelhouse. Plus, it pretty much guarantees he\u2019ll get a huge block of Southern votes. he could sail all the way to the Top 5 at least off that voting block.\n\nKeith loves Dexter\u2019s new haircut, which makes him look a bit more grown up and polished. However, he thinks Dexter had to do more than just sing it well. He needs to invest it with her personality. J-Lo says kind of the same thing and says that Dexter really has to believe he can win and he\u2019s starting to show that more. Harry says he thinks Dexter was really, really smart by doing a song that everyone knows and giving a solid performance. However, he needs to give it more creativity.\n\nVote Dexter Roberts: Text 1 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-01 (1-855-443-6501)\n\nBen Briley: \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d by Elton John from 27 Dresses\n\nHe\u2019s never seen the movie, but he loves Elton John, so Ben has picked a song that also happens to go with his name. He\u2019s cleaned up tonight and has his hair slicked back and is wearing some kind of fuzzy dark green suit. It\u2019s an interesting look\u2026 We aren\u2019t feeling really killer about this performance. It\u2019s nice, but not wow and he is not a wiz on the piano. It\u2019s just a little weak.\n\nThe American Idol judges don\u2019t think it was powerful enough either. Harry Connick Jr. in particular really gives him some harsh criticism, and even accuses Ben of not being real. Jennifer just doesn\u2019t know who Ben is an artist because he keeps wandering all over the map with his songs. Keith isn\u2019t thinking it so hot either and he feels like Ben has lost his authenticity and has lost his realness as an artist.\n\nVote Ben Briley: Text 4 to 83676 or call Call 1-855-4-IDOL-04 (1-855-443-6504)\n\nBefore the next performance, we take a break with host Ryan Seacrest to see how the voting is going so far, split by male and female votes.\n\nMajesty Rose York: \u201cLet It Go\u201d by Idina Menzel from Frozen\n\nMajesty says this song should have been written for her and she seems very, very confident about it. We think it is very daring to take on a song that is SO huge out there right now and just won an Oscar. The sad thing is that we feel she doesn\u2019t do a very good job with it at all. Although we\u2019re sure her fans will bash us for that. But she sounds like she\u2019s out of breath, she\u2019s pitchy, and she loses the high notes in places. Honestly, it sounds like one of her weakest performances.\n\nThe American Idol judges, however, are far more loving. Harry says he feels like Majesty is singing so many different kinds of things, he isn\u2019t sure exactly what kind of singer she is. However, he did think it was a strong performance. If she is going to do so many different styles though, she has to be perfect. Keith Urban says his wife (Nicole Kidman) and kids are watching from home and probably loving it. He says that it is a really big song though and she needed to ease in into it a little more and not attack it so much. J-Lo says she could be singing songs for Disney, or be an actress, or on Broadway, or whatever. She thinks it is a positive that Majesty has such variety, not a negative.\n\nVote Majesty Rose York: Text 7 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-07 (1-855-443-6507)\n\nCaleb Johnson: \u201cSkyfall\u201d by Adele from Skyfall\n\nOur rocker is dressed up tonight, going for a little bit of long-haired James Bond with his performance. We thought this song choice was really kind of odd\u2026 but we are actually loving it! It\u2019s a totally different side to Caleb hearing him do this kind of clear, sweet ballad voice. We don\u2019t know if the American Idol judges will like it, but we really dig him doing something different than his usual big rock.\n\nKeith Urban gives Caleb a brief standing ovation. He says Caleb was totally unpredictable tonight but still dependable, something Harry talked about last week. He loved it. Jennifer Lopez trips over her words but says she has been waiting for this kind of performance. Harry says he stands by saying last week this is his favorite group of contestants ever. He thinks the competition really started tonight and Caleb was \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nVote Caleb Johnson: Text 13 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-13 (1-855-443-6513)\n\nMK Nobilette: \u201cTo Make You Feel My Love\u201d by Garth Brooks & Trisha Yearwood from Hope Floats\n\nMK is doing a song from one of Harry Connick Jr.\u2019s movies tonight. She\u2019s not wearing a hat tonight, at last, but instead she has died her hair a crazy yellow and spiked it up. She apparently just can\u2019t have normal hair\u2026 But, of course, it\u2019s not about the hats or the hair. It\u2019s all about the voice. And, tonight, the Glee-style Sue Sylvester track suit. Okay, sorry, the voice. The song is good in places and weak in places\u2026 it\u2019s more the right kind of song but she\u2019s still lacking confidence and wanders off the pitch a bit. We wanted a strong, powerful ballad. This is more of a kind of a pretty but weaker ballad that doesn\u2019t really have the wow and ooomph she needed being in the bottom as she is.\n\nJennifer Lopez says she felt MK really trying to connect and talks about how she can\u2019t help thinking about k.d. lang when she hears her. Harry agrees with J-Lo that MK has a subtle voice and he thinks she does have star quality. He cautions her that she does need to be careful with runs if she does them, they have to be perfect. Keith says MK is still working on her performance but she sounded great tonight. He says there was a moment where she lost herself and the audience connected, and that\u2019s what she needs.\n\nVote MK Nobilette: Text 6 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-06 (1-855-443-6506)\n\nAlex Preston: \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d by The Swell from Once\n\nWe were very wary of Alex doing this song because it has been so done so many times. We especially remember Alex and Sierra doing this song on The X Factor and it was amazing. We don\u2019t now if Alex Preston really gets the same wow from the song that they did, but we do think it was very lovely. Not one of our favorite performances ever on Idol, but it is certainly one of the best of the evening.\n\nThe judges oddly don\u2019t really have a lot to say. They are just kind of say a few complimentary words and then move on very quickly. We feel like maybe they have been told they need to keep it short and go faster?\n\nVote Alex Preston: Text 9 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-09 (1-855-443-6509)\n\nJena Irene Ascuitto: \u201cDecode\u201d by Paramore from Twilight\n\nWe reserve all judgement about doing a song from Twilight, although it certainly appeals to a HUGE fan base out there, which is never a bad thing. We do feel this is probably the best female vocal performance of the night so far. Jena also doesn\u2019t have any problem banging on the keys for her performance, that\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s strong, on pitch, powerful, and the crowd is on it\u2019s feet.\n\nThe judges are on their feet too! Jena pulled it out tonight and it\u2019s obvious since the crowd will not shut up to let the judges talk. Keith says he loves when Jena plays the piano and gets fierce and \u2018hurtles along the cliff\u2019 with her performance. He loved it. J-Lo says she doesn\u2019t know why Jena was in the bottom three last week because she has one of the best voices and she\u2019s the real thing. America needs to get on board because that was the best performance of the night. Harry says he is a huge fan of Paramore and her performance was just as good as theirs but different and her own thing.\n\nVote Jena Irene Ascuitto: Text 8 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-08 (1-855-443-6508)\n\nMalaya Watson: \u201cI Am Changing\u201d by Jennifer Hudson from Dreamgirls\n\nMalay has the final \u2018pimp\u2019 spot tonight and the big power ballad as well. This is basically a recipe to pull in votes for her by the carload. We think the performance is strong and powerful, but\u2026 it kind of pales in comparison to Jennifer Hudson. If you put the two performances side by side, we just think Jennifer would blow Malaya away like a plastic bag in a windstorm. Certainly one of the top performances of the night and Malaya does a great job, but we don\u2019t think this will be one of those songs people are playing over and over years later.\n\nThe judges love it, of course, and they are full of praise for Malaya. Keith Urban is kind of the only one who gives a little criticism that she could have maybe pulled it back a little to give the performance more finesse.\n\nVote Malaya Watson: Text 2 to 83676 or call 1-855-4-IDOL-02 (1-855-443-6502)\n\nNote on American Idol Voting Numbers:\n\n* Please note that the American Idol phone numbers this year for the finalists are the same every week, unlike previous seasons when they depended on performance order!\n\nOr vote online via SuperVote at AmericanIdol.com or through the Idol app.", "928": "After two weeks of appropriately vague themes allowed the unrefined contestants to explore their individual artistry, I became more than a little apprehensive when Ryan said the top-11 would be singing the \"Songs of the Cinema\" on this week's installment of AMERICAN IDOL The lame OCEAN'S ELEVEN cold open, completed by the cheesiest \"This is AMERICAN IDOL\" ever to come out of Seacrest's mouth, made me worry that this could be one huge cheesetastic disaster. However, I forgot that the majority of this year's remaining contestants have shown a surprising talent for avoiding the clich\u00e9, a fact that made this the best week of IDOL all year!\n\nAs Ryan reminded us, this is one of the most important weeks of the IDOL season, as the contestants that survive Thursday's elimination are guaranteed a spot on this summer's Top-10 Nationwide Tour.\n\nWhile this week's performances were mostly stellar, some of the night's most entertaining moments were the \"audition\" clips. Keeping with the cinema theme, the producers had the other contestants \"audition\" to play the role of each performer before their song. The results were almost universally funny as the singers lampooned each other. Some of the best were the impressions of Malaya, who came off as a female Steve Urkel hyped on on ritalin and Red Bull.\n\nI mentioned it last week, but it seemed like Harry Connick Jr. fired a shot across Randy Jackson's bow when he said that if he were mentoring the contestants, he would be at their hotel until 5:00am helping them every night. This week, he followed up by introducing his brand new, never before used, completely original catchphrase, \"In it to win it!\" While THE VOICE has the bromance between Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, I would love to see a \"brofight\"... a \"brofeud\"...a \"brovalry\" on IDOL!\n\nFinally, two random notes: I am really glad that the powers that be finally allowed the contestants to stay backstage and prepare for their songs on their own, rather than making them suffer in the \"lounge\" all night. Also, can we just say that the live social-media voting-updates experiment failed? It Is useless, illogical, and a waste of \"brovalry\" time.\n\nOk, now on to the performances:\n\nSam Woolf\n\n\"Come Together\" by The Beatles\n\nFeatured in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\n\nThree-Word Review: Needs Charisma Transplant\n\nI'm gonna be honest, anytime anyone does an enjoyable Beatles-cover, I'm going to be along for the ride. This is the best I've seen from Sam since the live-shows started, but, as JLo said, he has a big problem communicating any sense of personality when he performs. Perhaps it's being 17, or perhaps it's being raised by his grandparents in a retirement community, but despite his loyal teen girl following, this could be a problem down the road.\n\nJessica Meuse\n\n\"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel\n\nFeatured in THE GRADUATE\n\nThree-Word Review: Actually Liked It\n\nI didn't notice the band issues that Jennifer and Harry mentioned; I simply heard an interestingly delivered cover of one of the best songs ever written. Jessica's vocal was by no means perfect, but it felt like a genuine, understated performance by an artist who is starting to figure out who she wants to be in this competition. At this point, I don't agree with JLo or Jessica that she can win, her voice is too tinny with occasional, weird eruptions of vibrato in all the wrong places, but I do feel like she is finding her niche and defining what kind of singer she will be post-IDOL.\n\nC.J. Harris\n\n\"Can't You See\" by Marshall Tucker Band\n\nFeatured in BLOW\n\nThree-Word Review: Actually In Tune!\n\nWhile in no way did C.J.'s performance deserve a Keith Urban standing O, nor a \"CJ, CJ\" chant from the audience, for the first time on the live shows, I actually remembered why C.J. made it this far. Heck, I think it was the first time he sang (mostly) in tune. Did it bring him to the forefront like Jen and Harry said? No, but it definitely bought him some time to keep working on his \"intonation\" issues.\n\nDexter Roberts\n\n\"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nFeatured in FORREST GUMP\n\nThree-Word Review: Karaoke Bar King\n\nHow can a contestant on a singing competition show sing one of the most \"sung-along-to\" anthems in America, and just sing it like he is having a few cold ones at his local Tuscaloosa watering hole? As Keith and Harry said, the performance was fine, but it was nothing memorable or special. It was just another dude singing \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" While \"fine\" might keep him safe in the competition for a few weeks, eventually, if he wants to win, he will have to figure out a way to be \"memorable and special\".\n\nBen Briley\n\n\"Bennie and the Jets\" by Elton John\n\nFeatured in 27 DRESSES\n\nThree-Word Review: Too Much False\n\nI don't understand why the judges always try to make the contestants pigeon-hole themselves into a certain genre or style (props to Keith for admiting the \"Change it up\" vs. \"Be yourself\" \"conundrum\"). While this week the judges were left wanting for authenticity from Ben, I really enjoyed seeing the different side of him. And I was pleasantly surprised that his first few transitions into his falsetto were surprisingly perfect. However, I think he lost it a bit in the extended head section; it sounded a bit flat, and exposed the fact that he probably doesn't have the range or strength to sing consistently in that section of his register. That being said, I actually enjoyed the performance, but it might not be enough to keep him out of danger.\n\nMajesty Rose\n\n\"Let It Go\" by Idina Menzel, not Adela Dazeem\n\nFeatured in FROZEN\n\nThree-Word Review: Let it NO!\n\nI blame this one completely on Randy Jackson. If he is supposed to be mentoring these kids, why did he not simply play Idina Menzel's Academy Awards performance for Majesty? How could the kindergarten teacher stand a chance on this Oscar-winning song if even a musical theatre icon like Idina struggled to sing it live? While I have liked Majesty all season, this was the epitome of bad high school talent show. If she is judged solely on this week's performance, she should be in the Bottom Three, and probably deserves to go home.\n\nBIASED JUDGING ALERT: While it has been a staple of previous IDOL seasons, tonight marked the first outbreak of bold-faced lying from the judges this season. There is no doubt that Majesty has been one of the show's favorites thus far, but, after this disastrous performance, the nonsensical compliments that the panel gave her proved that though Uncle Nigel Lythgoe is no longer running the show, his legacy of string pulling is very much still at play.\n\nCaleb Johnson\n\n\"Skyfall\" by Adele\n\nFeatured in SKYFALL\n\nThree-Word Review: Your American Idol!\n\nDo I think a contestant who was described in his \"audition\" intro package as the lovechild of Jack Black and Meatloaf can win the country's largest popularity contest? Probably not. However, at this stage of the competition, there is no doubt that he is hands down the most deserving, and it isn't even close. He is great every week, and with this detour off of his classic rock freight train, he showed that he isn't just a one-trick pony.\n\nMK Nobilette\n\n\"To Make You Feel My Love\" by Garth Brooks\n\nFeatured in HOPE FLOATS\n\nThree-Word Review: Nice But Limited\n\nThere were moments in this performance where MK sounded very nice. Much of the song sat nicely in the strong point of her voice. However, what the song ultimately showed was the severe limitations of her voice. As soon as the melody ventured outside her vocal comfort zone, the performance veered off the tracks. As the contestants begin to dwindle, having some nice moments isn't going to be enough. If MK survives this week, she has to start delivering completely memorable performances, not just individual moments.\n\nMUSIC THEORY ALERT: Harry dropped the term \"melisma,\" adding to his effort to make all IDOL viewers just a little bit smarter music connoisseurs.\n\nAlex Preston\n\n\"Falling Slowly\" by Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1\n\nFeatured in ONCE\n\nThree-Word Review: Fully Formed Artist\n\nI think this was a great choice for Alex. It seems to fit perfectly in his artistic sensibility, but still gave him a chance to experiment with the melody and add some impressive vocal flares. While all Broadway fans have come to know and love that song from ONCE's Tony-winning stage-turn, Alex's rendition was all his own, complimenting his unique performance style and individuality. He is a fully formed artist that is getting a well-deserved opportunity to shine on this big stage.\n\nJena Irene\n\n\"Decode\" by Paramore\n\nFeatured in TWILIGHT\n\nThree-Word Review: Best of Night!\n\nFull disclosure, I became a Jena fan after her wildcard performance sitting behind a piano, and without a doubt, this song, back at the keys, proved that my faith in her was justified. I know almost nothing about TWILIGHT (other than that my favorite, Anna Kendrick, was in it), so this song shocked me. Jena was powerful and interesting and entertaining and the best of the best tonight.\n\nMalaya Watson\n\n\"I Am Changing\"\n\nFeatured in DREAMGIRLS\n\nThree-Word Review: Well Hot Damn!\n\nWell, hold on just a minute. I know I just said that Jena was the best of the night, but I think that Malaya might have closed the show with a performance equal to Jena's. I was a little nervous when Ryan said Malaya was singing from DREAMGIRLS. I had visions of a spastic \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" playing in my head, but I was glad that she pulled out another one of the Broadway show's big, belty numbers. As I've said before, I like Malaya. I think she is extremely talented. The problem with her is that from week to week, you never know what you are going to get. She could slay a huge showtune, or she could flame out on an up-tempo dance hit. If she continues to play to her diva vocal strengths, the high school tuba player might just be a dark horse for the finals.\n\nWhile I don't see all (or maybe even any) of these three being in danger this week, I think they should be. With so many good performances tonight, I really wanted to include Sam Woolf's lazy performance, but on second though, it was just too well-sung to be included. To be honest, other than Majesty, I don't think anyone really deserves to be in the bottom, but that's not how the game is played. So...\n\n\n\nShould Be In the Bottom-Three\n\nDexter Roberts\n\nBen Briley\n\nMajesty Rose\n\nShould Be Eliminated (based solely on this week)\n\nMajesty Rose\n\nCo-Best of the Night\n\nJena Irene\n\nMalaya Watson\n\nI will be back to add pictures of each performance to jog your memory as soon as Fox releases them.

Luckily for the contestants of the Top 11, they nailed it. Even the bad performances weren't so bad, and there were some truly breakthrough performances. In a season where a lot of the singers surfacely only seem OK, this week, they proved they're \"in it to win it\" (as Harry Connick Jr. would say).\n\nSo, let's just get to the meat of it all, and look at who did well, not so well and well enough.\n\nThe Good:\n\nCJ Harris: You don't always need a big, swelling ballad to have one of the best performances on American Idol, and CJ Harris proved that very well with his take on The Marshall Tucker Band's \"Can't You See.\" Full of the perfect amount of rasp and controlled, strained vocals, his spin on this classic rock track is the first totally noteworthy performances on this season of Idol. Unlike a lot of the contestants, CJ was clearly at home on stage and he both looked and sounded like a very seasoned singer.\n\nAlex Preston: Alex Preston has such a beautiful vulnerability in his performances, so choosing the highlight of the indie flick Once, \"Falling Slowly,\" was a fantastic choice. With a slightly different arrangement, Alex was able to make this Oscar-winning song his own and evoke pure, strong emotions from the audience. Like CJ Harris, Alex showed there is pure power in the quiet moments and has established himself as a true frontrunner.\n\nCaleb Johnson: Caleb Johnson had grown to be quite predictable taken on frickin' Rush last week, so when tackled Adele's \"Skyfall\" this week, it was a welcome break from all that classic rock. Caleb took this James Bond song and made it feel like an epic '80s ballad, but that's in a good way. He showed off that he just has a killer range, and that can get lost in all the kitschy rock stuff, but here it worked really very well.\n\nMK Nobilette: By now, it's pretty much established that if MK Nobilette wants to get good feedback, she has to do something small and simple and quiet, which is why the oft-covered \"To Make You Feel My Love\" was a really great song choice. She finally seemed to have connected emotionally with a piece of music, falling perfectly into this pretty, simple little love song. If this doesn't pull her out of the bottom three, I don't know what possibly could.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBen Briley: Like \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" it's always super enjoyable to watch somebody sing Elton John's \"Bennie And The Jets.\" The judges noted that this was a weird song choice for Ben Briley, who's usually so country, but I think he was just trying to show his versatility. This is a campy song, and Ben took it there, lightly plucking at the piano keys and effortlessly moving about the stage. His vocals were a little off on the high notes and he did kind of miss the mark, but it isn't the worst thing we've seen on Idol this year, and it certainly wasn't boring.\n\nMajesty Rose: It must be so hard to even think about singing the epic Frozen song \"Let It Go,\" but Majesty Rose is one of, like, three Idol contestants this year who could have even considered it, and she did. First off, the arrangement she and the band worked out was so chopped up and amended; it was really distracting for basically everyone in the world who's singing that song right now. She did, however, do a decent job of showcasing how \"Let It Go\" builds, but the quiet bits at the beginning were much prettier and well done than the massively loud and proud ending. It's just hard to even try to be Idina Menzel, and I'm not so sure anybody should try.\n\nSam Woolf: Sam Woolf started off tonight's episode with his take on the Beatles' \"Come Together,\" in this case from Across The Universe. My favorite thing about this song is how raw and gritty it can be, and even though he's only 17 years old, Sam had the potential to take this song to a more rocking, sexy place and he, well, didn't. It was a just very neutered take. As the judges (particularly Jennifer Lopez) noted, he's getting more comfortable on stage, but he's not 100 percent loose yet. As for the vocals, they were totally solid -- Sam isn't just in the top 11 because of that smile, and he showed that again. He had some really nice runs near the end of the song that made up for how vanilla he was during the rest of the performance.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n\nJessica Meuse: There's something totally off about the American Idol band this season, namely in that they're just not very good and have a hard time melding with the singers. This was the case last week with Emily Piriz (who was eventually sent packing), and it definitely affected Jessica Meuse tonight. During her otherwise very pretty, simplistic take on Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound Of Silence,\" the band was so off for several bars that it was really unfortunate and distracting. Jessica handled it like a pro and kept on trucking, eventually allowing her unique tone to shine through. That whole band thing was just such a shame.\n\nDexter Roberts: It's always fun to watch somebody perform the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" and seeing Dexter Roberts do it is no different. Week after week, Dexter gives a solid, straightforward country performance and as he showed his little more rocking side, it worked. I still worry (like the judges) that he could get lost in the shuffle in the world of country, but it was enjoyable enough.\n\nJena Irene: Far and away, choosing to sing Paramore's \"Decode\" is the best decision Jena Irene has made so far this season on Idol... it's like this song was built for her. After two weeks straight in the bottom three, Jena had something to prove this week, and powered away at the piano. Her smoky, unique vocals fitted this chorus so well (sorry) that she should be able to move herself up in the Idol rankings. But if the fanbase isn't there... it isn't there. Jena is a wildcard pick, after all.\n\nMalaya Watson: Of course Malaya Watson was influenced by Dreamgirls, so for this week, the 16-year-old tackled the classic musical's \"I Am Changing.\" There's something very young Michael Jackson-y to Malaya's voice, and that never comes out more than when she's belting away on some big ol' ballad. That was the case here, and while it worked enough to make the judges proud, she's just still so young and it's quite distracting. Idol was clearly looking for a big moment with this song, and the producers kind of got it.\n\nWho Should Go Home:: Ben Briley\n\nWho Will Go Home: Either MK or Jena. Their performances were more solid than Ben's, but I just don't think they have strong fanbases.", "930": "Tonight the \"American Idol\" 2014 Top 11 attempt \"Songs From the Cinema.\"\n\nWill there a \"Titanic\" moment?\n\nWe know for sure we'll be looking closely at our Detroit contenders. Will they do a song from a Motor City-based soundtrack?\n\nMalaya Watson of Southfield could do a song from \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nSam Woolf of West Bloomfield could break out his shell a bit with \"Lose Yourself\" from Eminem's \"8 Mile Soundtrack.\"\n\nOr maybe Jena Irene Asciutto of Farmington Hills gets lost in the '80s with a song from the \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" movie.\n\nHere is what Shelby Miller, a Season 13 contestant from Portland, Michigan is looking for tonight (8 p.m., March 12, Fox). Shelby has been helping me out this season as guest blogger.\n\nShelby made it to Hollywood week and even survived the Group Round.

She just missed the Top 15 girls this season.\n\nFollow Shelby's career on her Facebook page.\n\nAs for the results this week, one contestant will be eliminated on March 13.\n\nSHELBY MILLER\n\nAmerican Idol's Top 11 will be performing in this week's episode for their place in the Top 10. At this point in the competition, every decision counts. I believe the most important aspect of the contestants' performances this week will be song choice.\n\nAlthough this may seem to be a simple part of the equation, song choice is where the performance stems from. A smart song choice will allow the contestant to show range, personality, control, and style.\n\nJena Irene is one competitor that I am interested to see choose a song this week. I did not believe Jena chose the right song last week, and this will be her chance to redeem herself. I think Jena has great potential, but she needs to think about her decisions this week. This is a make or break it situation for Jena in my opinion.\n\nAlex Preston on the other hand needs to think less about his performance and just let his worries go. It is easy for an audience to pick up on insecurities when an individual is placed in the middle of the iconic Idol stage, so Alex needs to take control of his performance. Alex has proven to show his artistry in past song choices and this week his focus should be on stage presence and a song that will allow him to move around the stage to really get the audience engaged.\n\nJessica Meuse must have control during her performance this week. I can tell that she has a unique tone, but I now need to see her power. Jessica must chose a song that will show her strengths. She also needs to keep control throughout this performance.\n\nAs for Dexter Roberts, the passion that he brought to last week's performance will be key. After the knock-out performance that he had in his Home Week performance, Dexter must keep the momentum going and show growth to ensure his place in the Top 10.\n\nI believe it is time for Caleb Johnson to step out of his comfort zone and chose a slower song. Caleb has shown us his powerhouse side, but it is time for the audience to see technique. Although it is possible to show technique in an upbeat song, I believe a slower song will show the diversity in Caleb's voice.\n\nMK Nobilette really needs to work on her stage presence and connection with the audience this week. Her voice demonstrates passion and true artistry, but it is hard for me to connect to the performance when her face reveals her nerves. If MK Nobilette can let loose and enjoy her time on stage this week, I believe she will be in the Top 10.\n\nCJ Harris must show control this week. I think the emotions got to him last week as he performed \"Change\" by John Mayer. CJ is one of those contestants that simply has raw talent, but I believe he needs to work with the vocal coaches this week and really learn how to make vocal choices with purpose.\n\nAs for Sam Woolf, I think it would be smart for him to work off of the energy that the audience gives him every week. An up-tempo song may be the best for this, simply because it will allow Sam to move to different parts of the audience and get the whole crowd involved. I believe Sam's vocals have been spot-on in the past weeks and so he just needs to continue to pick the right songs that will display the best aspects of his voice.\n\nBen Briley must choose a song that will help him to stand out this week. Although Ben performs well every week, I feel that he could be overlooked if he does not step up his game this week. Ben has great potential and continues to show growth so I am excited to see what he will do with this next performance.\n\nMalaya Watson performed a beautiful song last week and showed America that she is able to control her vocals like a pro. I hope to see the same control this week, but also want Malaya to have fun with her performance. I think the key to her success this week will be finding the middle ground between control and passion.\n\nLastly, Majesty Rose must make smart risks this week. I commend Majesty for taking the chance with her big note at the end of last week's performance, but I think it hurt the song more than anything. I know that she is capable of hitting those notes, but she must remain focused throughout the song this week. Majesty Rose has always been a favorite of mine, and I am hoping she can pull back to her roots this week.\n\nJohn Gonzalez is a statewide entertainment writer for MLive.com.

MK and I had a close bond because we were roommates. Jena and I had a great bond. I had a great bond with [Sam Woolf], [Alex Preston], [Dexter Roberts] -- I mean, really, all of us were so close. We all hung out together every night. But MK and I were roommates, so I guess we had that extra bond.\n\n\n\nThe video from your boyfriend was so sweet. How has he supported you in your music journey before and after ?\n\n\n\nEmily Piriz: Matt? He has supported me through everything.

The themes are kind of broad, but I think that's a good thing because it kind of allows every person to put a little bit of their individuality [into it], you know?

So you kind of get a feel for how that person kind of grew up or how that person feels about their family.\n\n\n\nI just wanted to clarify something you said. When you first choose your song, you're only given three to choose from? You can't deviate from that?\n\n\n\nEmily Piriz: No, there are pages and pages and pages of lists you can choose from. But a few days before, like Friday, you have to narrow it down to your three top choices that you want to choose from that are your possibilities. So you work those three out and pick which one you want the most... No, no, they let us choose.\n\n\n\nWhat did it feel like to you when you first stepped in front of the huge Idol audience? What was going through your head?\n\n\n\nEmily Piriz: Oh my gosh, it was a dream. It really didn't even feel real. It felt like I was sleepwalking. I didn't expect all the people to be standing around the stage. I didn't know that was going to happen.

I don't want 45 minutes.\"\n\n\n\nI stayed for, like, four hours just sitting, talking, and just enjoying each other's company.

I mean, last night, they had a car waiting for me and they told me I only had 45 minutes and I was like, \"Forget it, let the car go, I'm going to take a taxi. I don't want 45 minutes.\"I stayed for, like, four hours just sitting, talking, and just enjoying each other's company. Because, honestly, these are some of the best people I've ever met in my life. It was really hard to say goodbye.I'm just going to miss being able to spend time with all these amazing people. I mean, not only are they so talented, they just have such kind hearts and everyone is such a good person. It's so great being around them.Above is a portion of Emily Piriz's recent interview.

But even through all her tears, Emily said she was happy to be on the show, no matter what happened. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, she was expecting to go home so soon.\n\n\u201cI was still thinking positive when I sat on the stool,\u201d Emily Piriz said in her American Idol \u2018curtain call\u2019 video message to her fans. \u201cWhen I saw all the other people who sat in the stools, I mean, it was kind of a crazy night. My mind was all over the place. But I\u2019m just happy to be here, no matter what happens.\u201d\n\nEmily said her favorite performance from the show was \u201cStars\u201d during Hollywood Week. She felt like that was her big \u201cmoment\u201d on American Idol 2014. That\u2019s why she chose it as her save song last week. \u201cIt kind of made me a contender\u2026 The judges were cheering for me. It was an awesome moment.\u201d\n\nEven though her journey on the show has come to an end, Emily Piriz thanked her fans for voting for her and getting her so far. \u201cWithout you I would be nowhere,\u201d she said. \u201cTop 12, that is all I can ask for. This has been an amazing experience. I want to thank you so much. I love each and every one of you.\u201d", "934": "The \"American Idol\" 2014 has entered the most exciting stage of the show with competition getting tougher each passing week. The remaining top 11 contestants will take the stage on Wednesday to impress the judges and the American public.\n\nWednesday's episode, showcasing top 11 contestants, will be telecast at 8:00pm - 10 pm EST on Fox (6:30am - 8:30 am IST, Thursday).\n\nThemed \"Songs From the Cinema\", this week may see the contestants belting out some of the most powerful ballads for America's vote, as their fate in the competition entirely depends on the public. One contestant, who gets least vote, will be sent home on Thursday's episode.\n\nKristen O'Connor and Emily Piriz had been eliminated from the show since public voting started two weeks ago.\n\nLast week, themed \"Home\", saw Jena Irene performing \"Suddenly I See\" by KT Tunstall, Alex Preston - \"I Don't Want to Be\" by - Gavin DeGraw, Jessica Meuse - \"White Flag\" by Dido, Dexter Roberts - \"Lucky Man\" by Montgomery Gentry, Emily Piriz - \"Let's Get Loud\" by Jennifer Lopez, Caleb Johnson - \"Working Man\" by Rush, M.K.

Oh, and she\u2019s beautiful, too.\n\nSo when I saw J-Lo on the cover of InStyle magazine, I had to drop everything and read every word.\n\nWhen I was done, here\u2019s what I learned and what makes me adore this woman with all my heart:\n\n1. \u201cI\u2019m figuring it out as I go,\u201d Lopez admitted of her busy life as an American Idol judge, a single mom to 6-year-old twins, actress, singer and fashion designer. Aren\u2019t we all \u2014 figuring it out, that is? Good for her.\n\n2. Of her upcoming album, she said her message to the world has changed since her first batch of tunes. \u201cI used to be all \u2019I love you, hearts and flowers,'\u201d she said, \u201cbut now it\u2019s \u2019I love you, but I\u2019m not going to let you take advantage of me.'\u201d\n\n3. \u201cI\u2019m living a much more unscripted life right now than I have in a long time,\u201d she said. In a world of scripted reality, trying for an unscripted one sounds like a much better reality.\n\n4. Lopez is honest about the loneliness she faces. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t love being alone. I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t beat myself up for that.\u201d\n\n5. She is willing to share beauty secrets, beyond just eating healthy, exercising and sleeping well. She drinks detoxifying kombucha tea and uses Dr. Hauschka Skin Care Rose Day Cream.\n\n6. \u201cIt was hard not to be happy,\u201d Lopez said about seeing celebs over 40 \u2014 Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry, Sandra Bullock and more \u2014 on the covers of women\u2019s magazines.\n\n7. At the cover photo shoot, she \u201creally started grooving\u201d to Jay Z. I\u2019ll bet Beyonc\u00e9 would love to hear that.\n\n8. Her go-to outfit? \u201cWorn-out boyfriend jeans that hang below the hip bone are my favorite. I feel so me in them,\u201d she said.", "936": "We are in for another night of performances on American Idol 2014 and it looks like the Top 11 on American Idol Season 13 are going to be having a Movie Night with the American Idol judges 2014 (Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr.)!

Check out a sneak peek below in our American Idol 2014 spoilers video!\n\nLast week on American Idol Season 13, the Top 12 took on the theme of \u201cHome\u201d and performed songs that reminded them of home. While the judges were very critical with the contestants and were even harsh at times, they just wanted more and more from them.

Kristen O'Connor was the first contestant to leave the competition from the top 13, followed by Emily Piriz.\n\nThe songs to be performed by the remaining 11 contestants have not been revealed yet but they are expected to render some of the most powerful ballads. However, it won't be easy to choose songs that suit them and their taste.\n\nHere is the list of songs performed by contestants last week:\n\nJena Irene - \"Suddenly I See\" by KT Tunstall\n\nAlex Preston - \"I Don't Want to Be\" by - Gavin DeGraw\n\nJessica Meuse - \"White Flag\" by Dido\n\nDexter Roberts - \"Lucky Man\" by Montgomery Gentry\n\nEmily Piriz - \"Let's Get Loud\" by Jennifer Lopez\n\nCaleb Johnson - \"Working Man\" by Rush\n\nM.K.

However, their performance will determine who moves on to the next round, as it will be the public and not the judges - Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick Jr. - who will vote their favorite contestants to the top 10 list.", "939": "Let me start by saying that all the contestants on Season 13 of American Idol seem like truly lovely people. And also that I'd rather watch the green paint dry on that house in True Detective than sit through another ...\n\nLet me start by saying that all the contestants on Season 13 of American Idol seem like truly lovely people. And also that I'd rather watch the green paint dry on that house in True Detective than sit through another 11 weeks of performances from this crew.\n\nAnd apparently, I'm not alone. Idol's ratings have (once again) been in steady decline this season and hit an all-time low a couple of weeks ago with the Feb. 20 episode. Granted, the show faced stiff competition early on this year from the Winter Olympics, but its post-Olympics numbers remain languid.\n\nHow the American Idol judges failed MK Nobilette\n\nOf course, the numbers could just be an indicator that overall interest in American Idol has started to evaporate. Despite rave reviews for its new judges panel (more on them later), the reality juggernaut premiered to its lowest numbers ever back in January. Last season's winner, Candice Glover, is undoubtedly one of the greatest vocal talents ever to come out of the show - yet her debut album, which was released last month, sold an anemic 19,000 copies in its first week. That's the lowest debut for an Idol winner in the show's history. The newly-implemented \"50 votes per device\" rule also signifies that voting numbers may be down as well.\n\nMemo to Fox: If you want to bring viewers back, this group of contestants isn't the way to do it. Not only are their vocal talents - at least based on the live performances we've seen - middling at best, the behind-the-scenes videos make it seem like there are no standouts personality-wise either.\n\nCould it be that the well of talent has simply run dry? That seems unlikely. There are still reality show contestants who can light up a living room (we're looking at you, Bria Kelly on The Voice!), and viewers don't even need to look past Idol's Top 30 round to find talent that would be better suited than this year's Top 13. Three weeks into the live shows, it's mind-boggling that singers like Kenz Hall and Briana Oakley were passed over in favor of Malaya Watson and the swiftly-eliminated Kristen O'Connor.\n\nAmerican Idol: Why we're mad about Harry\n\nWhich brings us to the judges. After last year's disastrous Battle of the Divas, the current panel of Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and rookie Harry Connick, Jr. is like a breath of fresh air. But unfortunately, the theme of this season - which has been repeated by Ryan Seacrest, new mentor Randy Jackson, and the contestants themselves - is quickly becoming \"the judges are too harsh.\" Well, frankly, they don't have a lot to work with. And let's be clear: we're not talking Simon Cowell levels of mean here. We simply mean that the judges should tell a singer when he or she is singing in the wrong key, failing to stay in sync with the band, or making horrible choices when it comes to song arrangement (see: Majesty Rose's \"Fix You\").\n\nOn last Thursday's show, while Harry was forced to defend his no sugarcoating policy, he backpedaled right into saying that the overall level of talent on this season of Idol is just as high as Season 1. (Insert Liz Lemon eyeroll.) That smash you may have heard immediately after his statement was \"Junior\"'s credibility careening out of the room like a bat out of hell.\n\nWhy Keith Urban is our favorite Idol judge - in GIFs\n\nSo, is this season unsalvageable? Let's hope not. Here's what we'd like to see from the remaining 11 contestants in the coming weeks to inject a little life into Season 13:\n\nSam: Sam's got the Girl Vote going for him this season, but he's going to need to rely on more than that to make it all the way. He could start by breaking out of his singer/songwriter shell and show the audience that he can do more than sing softly while strumming a guitar. Song suggestion: \"Grenade\" by Bruno Mars\n\nAlex: As it stands now, Sam and Alex are the dueling WGWGs of Season 13, so Alex also needs to do something to differentiate himself. He seems more willing to take risks when it comes to musical arrangements, so we'd like to see a little more out-of-the-box song choices. Song suggestion: \"Say Something\" by A Great Big World\n\nMajesty: Majesty seems to be holding back a little bit this season. We love her guitar playing and prefer when she sticks to more upbeat songs, but we're waiting to see a big breakout performance. She needs to choose songs that will highlight her range rather than cause her to overshoot it. Song suggestion: \"Shake It Out\" by Florence + the Machine\n\nFall TV Scorecard: What's renewed? What's canceled?\n\nDexter: Dexter has a great voice, but we'd love for him to break out of the country mold. It would be great if he could surprise us with a straightforward rock performance - or something even a little more out of left field. Song suggestion: \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" by Bon Jovi\n\nCaleb: As noted by Harry last week, Caleb is the most consistent finalist, and also looks like he's having the most fun on stage every week. But like Jennifer pointed out, his performances are starting to be a bit predictable - and that's never a good thing this early in the competition. Show us your softer side, Caleb! Song suggestion: \"Lips of an Angel\" by Hinder\n\nJessica: Jessica gets points for exploring different genres, and we love that she's able to put her own spin on the covers. Like Majesty, she's another contestant who we believe has a knockout performance in her that's just waiting to be let out. Song suggestion: \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac\n\nBen: Like the Alex/Sam dynamic, Ben finds himself as the secondary country counterpart to Dexter, so he needs to cultivate his own fan base - and quickly. Offering a knock-out rendition of a current radio hit would be a great way to do so. Song suggestion: \"Wake Me Up\" by Avicii\n\nAlt TV: 21 offbeat shows you should be watching\n\nC.J.: CJ's great strength is the lovely rasp that sneaks into his voice on occasion, so he needs to take on a song that will bring this to the forefront. Combined with his guitar playing, he has ample ability to put a modern spin on an old-fashioned classic. Song suggestion: \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" by Percy Sledge\n\nMalaya: Malaya has not had the greatest showing in these early weeks, so she really needs to pull something out of her hat if she wants to stay in the competition. Our suggestion is for her to avoid the ballads and do a high-energy number that will snap the audience to attention. Song suggestion: \"Counting Stars\" by OneRepublic\n\nJena: Probably more so than any contestant this season, Jena's voice has a truly unique quality and tone. We know she can tackle the bigger songs, but the best choice would be to perform something that lets her showcase quiet moments and big notes in equal measure. Song suggestion: \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus\n\nMK: Our biggest tip for MK is to find a way to get rid of the deer-in-headlights expression she wears every time she's onstage. Short of that, it would be nice to see MK tackle a more upbeat number - although those two things may be mutually exclusive. Song suggestion: \"Pompeii\" by Bastille\n\nWhat do you think of the contestants on this season of American Idol?

Jennifer seemed to love it.\"\n\nAmerican Idol's Kristen O'Connor: \"Beautiful Disaster\" wasn't my first choice\n\nThough the cameras repeatedly cut to Lopez dancing in her chair during Piriz's performance, her fellow judge Harry Connick, Jr. was less enthused - and Piriz says she \"wasn't super surprised\" that she landed in the bottom three on Thursday. \"Although the song that I chose was a good performance song, it wasn't the best vocal song, so I understood,\" she says. \"I didn't think the judges were going to use their save, just because it is so early in the season ... so, I was a little choked up but I just wanted to leave with a bang.\"\n\nOf the judges panel overall, Piriz tells TVGuide.com: \"They've been a little harder on us this year, but they just want us to do our best and they've been giving really great feedback. Everything Harry says, although sometimes people think it sounds harsh, everything he's saying is in our best interest and everything they've been telling us has really been helping us improve as artists.\"\n\nCheck out Piriz's answers to our American Idol exit interview lightning round below. Were you disappointed to see her go home?\n\n1. Name three albums you would bring with you to a desert island. This is hard. I'd probably bring a Sublime album, a Jonas Brothers album and Cute Is What We Aim For.\n\n2. What was the first album you fell in love with? Probably Aaron Carter, the one with \"I Want Candy.\"\n\n3. If someone wanted to torture you with a song on repeat, what would it be? Oh, gosh. Probably the \"Cha-Cha Slide.\"\n\n4. Name a song you wish you'd written. \"Stars\" by Grace Potter & the Nocturnals. That song is amazing. I love that song. It's beautiful.\n\n5. If you could duet with anyone living or dead, who would you pick? Ooh, that's hard. I'd love to duet with Pink or Kelly Clarkson. That would be cool.\n\n6. What's your most embarrassing karaoke or singing experience? In the sixth grade talent show, I was singing \"When You're Gone\" by Avril Lavigne and I was hitting a high note and my voice totally cracked. And it was really embarrassing, but I won anyway. I don't know how. That was embarrassing. My friend still teases me to this day.\n\n7. What's your favorite album or song that you're listening to currently? \"Say Something \" byGreat Big World and Christina Aguilera. I listen to it on repeat whenever it's on. I don't know why, but I'm obsessed with that song. There's so much emotion. It's such a simple song, but it's beautiful.\n\n8. What song or artist made you want to be a singer? Probably Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You.\" When I was little, that was my go-to singing song. I was just obsessed with her. I started playing the piano because she played the piano.\n\n9. What's your biggest musical guilty pleasure? I like listening to the High School Musicalsoundtracks and Hannah Montana and stuff. [Laughs]\n\n10. What's one song you would have loved to perform on Idol that you didn't get to? This week I was going to sing \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" so I would have loved to have done that, because I practiced it and I was really happy with it. I was going to do the Pink version that she did at the Oscars.\n\nView original American Idol's Emily Piriz: The Judges \"Have Been a Little Harder On Us This Year\" at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com American IdolAlicia KeysJennifer LopezKelly ClarksonAaron CarterAvril LavigneHarry Connick Jr.Christina AguileraPinkHigh School MusicalHannah MontanaJonas BrothersGrace Potter and the NocturnalsA Great Big WorldEmily Piriz\n\nTV Guide iPhone App TV Listings New Tonight on TV", "941": "Check out the charts above showing who you think will win Season 13 of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d The chart on the left is from last week\u2019s Top 12 showdown, while the right-hand side is this week\u2019s current results for the remaining Top 11 contestants.\n\nSam Woolf is still the far-away frontrunner to win the title with leading 27/20 odds, but check out the drama that\u2019s happening in second place.\n\nMalaya Watson and M.K.

Last night the reign of Arthur Chu as the mastermind \"Jeopardy\" champion ended. It's going to cost you 6400 dropping you to zero. Reporter: As one of the most successful runs in \"Jeopardy\" history ended. An 11-game winning streak which Chu raked in close to 300 thousand how. Arthur's game. Reporter: From the beginning this polarizing contestant stirred controversy with his unorthodox strategy. Who is Dr. Mo rchreau. Reporter: The tactics are simple. Number one, what are daily doubles? Go to the higher Numbers hunting for those money makers. Tactic number two, what is the Forrest bounce. My regards -- Named after a former contestant it means bouncing from category to category hoping to throw off opponents. And tactic number three, what is the buzzer system? Real easy important one. Get buzzed in first. Arthur? But after a few missteps -- What is the two pen in I opera. No. Reporter: Even this most extraordinary thing had to come to an end. David Chu -- Arthur Chu. Arthur, it was compulsively watchable. Thank you. And for really the reasons we just stated. This unconventional strategy of yours but this is something that you actually did a lot of research into. Right, right. I spent a lot of time -- well, it wasn't a lot of time because I had 30 days between being called and know I would be on the show. There is a huge community of \"Jeopardy\" fan, past \"Jeopardy\" champions that talk about this stuff just sitting around and discuss the games as they come on every night and immerse yourself in the culture and find out about strategies like that, you know and put together the pieces. It sort of paid off, almost 300 granldz. How did your family reacty. My mom was really happy. She was there watching all my games. She lives in L.A. I called my wife and said I have some disappointing news, some bad news. I'm going to have to take another day off work and fly out here again and she was -- actually got her for a second. She almost fainted. Have you thought about how you'll spend the money? I've thought about it. The main thing is, you know, don't want to do anything crazy or stupid. I have been strategic and want to in the future. We do want to go to China. She's never been and want to see relatives I haven't seen for a very long time and, you know, maybe start thinking about buying a house in the future. There you go. I do want -- we are, in fact, will be joined by another great \"Jeopardy\" champion. He had a message for you. So do we have it? Hi, Arthur, this is he, ken, Jennings, I just wanted to say you have nothing to be ashamed of. Congratulations. You were on the show for a long time. You were on the show for -- you were on the show for how many games? For 11 games? You were on the show for 11 games. 11! I do 11 like before lunch. I wonder as I walk back into the social square. Somebody like ken Jennings, he loomed for you. I know that was a guy that motivated you as you were pushing along. We're going to walk him in. I know you've been -- it is not easy taking these questions live he here. What do you say we give that another pull. It's \"Gma\" \"Jeopardy\" time. All right. Meanwhile, viewers, not something you can study. Playwrights. This Irish born playwright is the only one to win an Oscar and Nobel prize for literature. I need the answer in the form of a question.

At the end of his 11-episode winning streak, he departs with $297,200 in winnings \u2014 the third-highest of all time, and qualifies for the show\u2019s Tournament of Champions. He also knew he had it coming; the episode was recorded back in November.\n\nMeanwhile, Diana Peloquin can look forward to some unexpected, and much-deserved, fame. The grad student (and synchronized swimmer!) correctly answered the last question, keeping her first-place spot and booting Chu in the process. By some accounts, she\u2019s practically a national hero.\n\nRead more entertainment news", "959": "Arthur Chu, the 30-year-old trivia guru who won 11 straight games on Alex Trebek's Jeopardy! and accumulated nearly $300,000 in prize money, was finally beaten on Wednesday evening (March 13, 2014), finishing in third place with zero dollars.\n\nAlex Trebek Finally Got Rid of Arthur Chu\n\nThe bold, brash Ohio quiz whiz polarized audiences during his time on the show and many harboured a desire to see Chu meet his match and lose. That eventually came in the form of Diana Peloquin, who finished with $15,700 to unseat the reigning champion and begin her own quest to eclipse legendary quiz king Ken Jennings, who won 74 times and amassed $2.5 million in 2004.\n\nChu had angered some viewers for his aggressive style of play, jumping around the board instead of traditionally knocking off an entire category. In fairness to the 30-year-old, he had always been open about researching the best methods to win the game show.\n\nMore: watch Alex Trebek rapping an entire category on Jeopardy!\n\n\"It's a way to keep an edge on my opponents, keep them on their toes instead of making myself predictable,\" Chu told CNN's Jake Tapper last month, \"It's one of the few choices you have in the game, is what clues you pick and, if you make yourself predictable, you give up a huge edge.\"\n\n)\n\nChu also gained notoriety for being an outspoken Twitter user, describing himself as a \"mad genius, comedian, actor and freelance voiceover artist\" and regularly tweeting about his performance during tapes episodes.\n\nSome users had begun the hashtag \"IHateChu\" while others branded him arrogant.\n\nNevertheless, it didn't seem to faze the Ohio man, who tweeted after his defeat:\n\n\"Just have to console myself with being a guest on #GoodMorningAmerica and #LiveWithKellyAndMichael and almost $300,000\"\n\nHe is scheduled for a Reddit AMA on Thursday and promises, \"This will be the 1st time I get to talk about @Jeopardy completely freely with no gag order, so have at it, fellows\"", "960": "Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu, who won big money while taking heat for his unconventional style, has been defeated.

He has become possibly the game show\u2019s most controversial contestant for his playing strategy, in which he jumped around the board instead of going through the categories straight down.\n\nHe ended his last game on Wednesday in third place with zero dollars, after betting all of that night\u2019s $7,600 winnings on a question he failed to answer correctly. The Final Jeopardy question asked contestants to identify the last male monarch who had not been Prince of Wales. The answer was George VI, and only Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Michigan got it right. She took the Jeopardy throne from Chu and went home with $15,700.\n\nJeopardy Champ Arthur Chu\u2019s Final Hurrah\n\nChu\u2019s renegade playing style both angered and awed the long-running game show\u2019s fans, with some calling him a villain and others, a hero. Traditionalists commented he was unsportsmanlike, while others became inspired. During Wednesday\u2019s game, Peloquin also used unconventional strategies to build up her lead, seemingly giving Chu a dose of his own medicine.\n\nChu explains that the strategy is rooted in game theory, and was not actually revolutionary in terms of the game show. Chuck Forrest, who was a \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant in 1985, did the same thing, and became known for it so much that the game plan was labeled \u201cForrest Bounce.\u201d Chu said that by being unpredictable, opponents are put off-balance, allowing for an initial advantage. The strategy increases a contestant\u2019s chance of winning, and Chu said he saw no reason not to apply it.\n\nAfter his winning streak ended, Chu tweeted his thanks to his fans and announced that he would be doing an \u2018Ask me Anything\u2019 session on Reddit on Thursday. In an interview, Chu said he hopes his media exposure earns him greater opportunities as a voiceover artist.\n\nThanks for all the love guys.

Julie Hornick, a librarian from Summerville, South Carolina, was in second with $5,400, while Arthur trailed with $4,800.\n\nIn the Double Jeopardy round, Peloquin scored again with a Daily Double (and Chu lost everything on the second one), and by the end, she led with $12,100, while Hornick had $7,800 and Chu had $4,800. The Final Jeopardy category was British Royalty, and the clue was: \"He was the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.\"\n\nThe correct response was \"Who was George VI?\" and Peloquin was the only contestant to get it right, leaving her with $15,700.\n\nAnd while you might think Peloquin winced when watching herself occasionally make an error - like identifying Sally from the Peanuts comic strip as Lucy - she said, \"It\u2019s funny.

Previously, the majority of its Facebook and Twitter posts were simple hints to Jeopardy questions or promotion of contests. Now, the show has realized that Chu was the star, the draw, the main reason people want to watch. Not the trivia, and not just Trebek. \"We know that ratings go up when a contestant goes on a streak, so by the same logic social engagement goes up when people see a contestant on the run,\" Shapiro said. Jeopardy's social media job, then, is to promote that contestant more actively and let everyone know a streak is in progress.\n\nThe show previously would promote contestants only once they reached a streak of five consecutive wins, a relatively high bar. That's now down to three in a row, Shapiro told The Wire. \"People started talking about [Chu] after his third win, too,\" she said. \"It's certainly given me ... the idea that maybe we should be doing more with people who have won three games.\"\n\nOne reason Chu has gained such notoriety is his tweeting about the show and shaming his haters as his episodes appear on TV. (The episodes were filmed back in November.) He jumped from a follower count of a few hundred to just over 11,000 during his run. \u201cChu is the first contestant we know of that reached this many people through social media,\u201d Shapiro told The New Yorker. That attention was great for Chu, who said in that same article that he'd like to create a career as a motivational speaker.\n\nTwitter's help in pushing Chu to nightly news star was not lost on Jeopardy. \"Yes, we definitely saw a spike in social engagement for the weeks he was on,\" Shapiro confirmed to The Wire in an email. To keep that momentum going, the show is enlisting Arthur's help, and his Twitter handle.\n\n(No, he would not hang on.) Indeed, the live-tweeting of episodes among contestants has taken on a life of its own, and was especially noticeable during the College Tournament. Those 18-to-22-year-old contestants happily tweeted about their clothes, about Trebek, and about their grievances with the questions without spoiling the end. That could be the norm for contestants soon enough.\n\nThe goal to increase Jeopardy's social media presence and appeal to young people could create some issues should future contestants knowingly play into that villainous role that Chu created. What happens when new contestants get on the show only to cheekily launch a viral campaign for themselves? Could we see intentional sniping between contestants? Perhaps a funky bowtie or a Terd Ferguson-like hat? Getting attention from Trebek rapping or weighing in on the pronunciation of GIF is one thing. How will the show react when a contestant shows up in clown makeup?\n\nKeith Williams, for one, thinks the show's contestants trend too geeky to ever be as salacious as other reality shows. However, he notes their opportunity. \"In a lot of cases [it's] the only chance they'll ever have to be on national television and be seen by 15 million people.\" Those 15-minutes of fame can be appealing to everyone. Just ask Arthur. \u201cBasically, I like attention,\" he told The New Yorker. It seems Jeopardy does, too.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.", "974": "Meet Jeopardy!'s new master--and his controversial strategy [Podcast interview]\n\nArthur Chu is mopping the floor at the American game show Jeopardy!, a program that combines trivial knowledge, speed on a signaling device, game strategy, a mind for wagering, and flopsweat. At this writing, he's won $261,000 across nine episodes of the show, which is celebrating its 30th season in its current incarnation with Alex Trebek as the host. He returns Monday, March 10, for his tenth outing.\n\nArthur and I recorded this podcast on March 5 about his run on the show, and focused especially on his game strategy. (See the notes below for links to several things we talked about.) While the program is syndicated and almost impossible to view most episodes outside of broadcast TV, someone has uploaded all of Arthur's episodes to YouTube, where (as long as Sony Pictures seemingly ignores it) you can watch his run to date.\n\nArthur has been a surprising lightning rod for criticism. While other contestants have won games across two weeks, few have experienced the level of public criticism that he has. People on discussion forums and social networks accuse him of ruining the game by playing an effective strategy: he doesn't pick clues from top to bottom in each category. Rather, he hunts for the Daily Doubles: one square in the first round and two in the second which allow one to wager either up to one's entire current cash balance or the highest amount in the round, whichever is more. (That's $1,000 in the first round and $2,000 in Double Jeopardy.)\n\nThe Daily Doubles aren't randomly placed, but occur most frequently in certain columns and at certain values. By finding these squares, which do not contain clues harder than what would ordinarily be in that spot, a contestant can take control of the game long before the Final Jeopardy question in which all participants can answer.\n\nBy winning without \"playing the game right,\" combined with a style of mashing the signaling device (it's not a buzzer!) and a seeming lack of enjoyment while he plays, he's apparently angered people who claim he is ruining Jeopardy! and that he should just give up and lose. The 30-year-old married man is certainly low-key on screen; his Twitter handle is @arthur_affect, which gives you a sense of his self-awareness and dry wit, too. He's been live tweeting the games Eastern Time (he lives in Ohio), and is generally a pretty hilarious fellow. (He's also a skilled voice-over artist.)\n\nBut there's more than a tinge of racism and neurotypical shaming to it, too: he's an Asian-American nerd, and somehow the combination of geek concentration (a slack face, which we all know too well from our own reflection) and his genetic origin seem to have cast him in the role of a villain in many people's eyes. You can easily find tweets that use racial epithets and stereotypes to mock him, although there's a lot of dislike for him being a nerd, too.\n\nI don't think Arthur is ruining the game or playing it \"wrong\"\u2014nor does Ken Jennings. I won two games of Jeopardy! in 2012, and wrote about it here at Boing Boing. Ken won 74 games and 2,520,700 in 2004, and wrote the book Brainiac, a combination of memoir of his time on the show and detailed research and reporting on trivia in history and the present day. (He's since written four more books.) He did a lovely interview with Arthur at Slate that covered a lot of the issues around becoming a lightning rod for people's attention.\n\nArthur plays the game masterfully, and dedicated a lot of his preparation time to determining a game strategy: which clues to go after, how to bet, and how to even slightly unnerve the competition by mixing things up. He's playing his own game, although he points out that two other high-dollar winners in the past, Dave Madden and Roger Craig, both played in equally idiosyncratic ways and didn't seem to affect most subsequent players.\n\nBut Arthur has dominated Twitter this time around as well as Jeopardy!, and received more press coverage online and in print than anyone since Ken. This extensive discussion about his new method of playing could bring in a new style, just as Moneyball's coverage of the effective use of statistics to find underpriced gems among players changed baseball forever.\n\nThings we discussed in the podcast:\n\nI wrote a few items for the Economist about my Jeopardy! run, and one of them involved an academic paper by one of the IBM teams that worked on Watson, the natural-language processing and answering system that beat Ken and Brad Rutter. (Brad won the most on the show when including tournaments.) The paper discussed Watson's wagering strategy, which closely conforms to how Arthur prepared.\n\nWe mentioned several other Jeopardy! winners, including Dave Madden, still in the No. 2 all-time regular season cash spot at this writing from his 2005 run of 19 days with $430,400; Tom Nissley ($235,405 in 2010) and Roger Craig ($230,200 that same year), both of whom Arthur bumped down as he took the No. 3 position at this writing. (Roger appeared on Ask Me Another, an NPR quiz show, and was taken down quickly!)\n\nLet us never forget Sean Connery as played by Darrel Hammond on Saturday Night Live.\n\nBob Harris wrote a strategy book about his many appearances on the show that hides a wonderful memoir: Prisoner of Trebekistan. A somewhat older but still useful book, now out of print but available used, is Secrets of the Jeopardy Champions by Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal.\n\nThe invaluable J-Archive, which contains every clue and answer and wager for nearly every episode, also has a glossary of the specialized terms people have come up with for strategies over the years. Arthur says Keith Williams \"The Final Wager\" site contains all the information you need about understanding how to bet in Final Jeopardy.", "975": "While rumors have been flying about a possible reunion, who better to ask than the writer herself? Tina Fey weighs in on the future of the film.\n\nPhoto credit: Apega/WENN.com\n\nIt has been nearly 10 years since Mean Girls was released, and there have been plenty of rumors of a sequel or reunion for the cult classic. Lindsay Lohan commented on those rumors last week, but this time, the creator herself decided to set the record straight.\n\nTina Fey was out promoting her new film, Muppets Most Wanted, and opened up about the future of a little film that brought huge success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the tenth anniversary of the movie,\u201d Fey told E! News. \u201cWe\u2019re working on the musical, that\u2019s going to be in a couple years, I guess. So hopefully there will be like a screening or a party, but that\u2019s it. But that would be good, right?\u201d\n\nWhile that pretty much shuts down any possibility of a second film, a musical is bound to be hilarious, and maybe even just as successful as the movie. And the movie\u2019s stars \u2014 Tina Fey, Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Tim Meadows and others \u2014 may very well be signing on to appear in the stage version of the story. Fey didn\u2019t say anything about a possible reunion of those stars on the tenth anniversary of Mean Girls, coming up on April 30.\n\nLohan first brought up the rumors, telling Jimmy Fallon, \u201cI saw Tina and she mentioned doing a reunion. She said she was talking to Lorne [Michaels] about it. She\u2019s talking to the big boss.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, Lohan made a plea to Fey, suggesting she would be on board if a new movie were in the works.\n\n\u201cTina, this is important,\u201d she said while looking directly at the camera. \u201cThis needs to happen.\u201d\n\nFor fans searching for more of Fey\u2019s brilliance, Muppets Most Wanted will be in theaters March 21.", "976": "Tina Fey has addressed the talk of an upcoming Mean Girls sequel in response to the rumors which have reached a maximum as the 2004 comedy movie's 10 year anniversary rolls into view. Fey was direct in putting the rumour to bed when she appeared on Jimmy Fallon's inaugural episode of The Tonight Show, however the actress did allude to a potential 10 year meet-up for the cast to mark the occasion.\n\n\n\nTina Fey Has Stomped On The Recent 'Mean Girls' Sequel Rumours.\n\nThe 30 Rock star said \"At most, it would be like a panel discussion with a plate of hot wings. It's definitely not a movie.\" When asked if she had written another movie, she replied \"No! I wish I had written a movie. No, it's just [...] Mostly we're trying to get a party going.\" Fey offered some hope when she revealed that she and her husband, the composer Jeff Richmond, are currently developing a musical stage adaptation of the oft-quoted teen flick.\n\nWatch The 'Mean Girls 2' Trailer:\n\n\n\nDiehard fans of the franchise may remember the 2011 TV movie sequel, Mean Girls 2, which followed a similar plot to its predecessor but had none of the core cast or Fey's razor-sharp writing so failed to capitalise on the original success of Mean Girls. The fate of this easily-forgotten, dodgy reboot serves as a damning warning notice for any official sequel.\n\nMean Girls 2 may have stood up on its own if it hadn't been overshadowed by Mean Girls from the off. Rather than bringing any new angle on the franchise, such as issues like cyber bullying, the Melanie Mayron-directed movie rehashed the jokes and scenes of its predecessor with little critical or commercial success after the initial buzz.\n\n\n\nNowadays, Lindsay Lohan Is A Long Way From Her Fresh-Faced 'Mean Girls' Character.\n\nThere have been plenty of sequels made for movies that really, really didn't warrant one ('Grown Ups 2'?) and a hastily made sequel only represents the greed of Hollywood rather than the wishes of fans. Fey's career has come a long way since writing her 2004 screenplay debut and for a comedy talent who rarely sets a foot wrong, a brick wall approach to an extension of her most successful project is probably a wise move.", "977": "Lindsay Lohan teased fans yesterday with a picture of herself from the sit of 2 Broke Girls, standing next to star Kat Dennings, with the pair both wearing wedding dresses \u2013 what could she be up to now?\n\nIn 2 Broke Girls, Lindsay will be seen playing the role of Clare who will seek the help of her pals Max and Caroline to make her wedding cake.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Kat who plays the role of Max, posted a picture of herself in a meringue style wedding fown standing next to Lindsay who looked elegant in a slimming, A-line style gown.

People were doing that anyway before, but now even more people are going to. And you know what? I think that's so hypocritical. I mean, imagine if someone like Jamie Dornan claimed to have slept with 36 Hollywood ingenues. (Oh, he's on Lindsay's list, by the way.) Would anyone be surprised -- or even scandalized?\n\nMaybe we'd call him a player. But if you're a woman who's had many, many paramours, you're a slut. Right? Well screw that! Not literally -- you know what I mean. I say good for Lindsay. I hope she used protection, and I hope it was all fun. I don't think I'd want to have sex with 36 people myself, but I'd take a couple (or four, or more ...). I mean, almost everyone on the list is hot. Basically Lindsay took advantage of one of the great perks of being famous. Many a rock star has done much worse.\n\nBlah blah blah -- you want to know who else is on this list, right? Okay, fine. Here's a few of Lindsay's luvuhhs.\n\nAdam Levine\n\nZac Efron\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nColin Farrell\n\nEvan Peters\n\nJames Franco\n\nHeath Ledger\n\nMax George\n\nGarrett Hedlund\n\nCalum Best (okay, not all of these guys are A-listers)\n\nOh yeah, and some married guys, which does pose an awful problem for them. I'm sure they won't be thrilled to have been exposed like this, nor will their wives. Should we expect a rash of Hollywood breakup stories in the wake of this tell-all? That's the only thing I'm worried about. But then, if you care about your marriage, don't sleep with Lindsay Lohan. Know what I mean?\n\nDo you think this would be a big deal at all if a male actor had leaked a similar list of women he'd slept with?\n\nImage via Pacific Coast News", "999": "Tina Fey has put a stop to all the Mean Girls sequel rumours that have been circulating lately, saying that a follow-up to the oft-quoted 2004 teen hit is out of the question. Fans are largely split between two camps: those who would love to see a sequel with Lindsay Lohan and the original crew, and those who think another film would be laboured, unnecessary and run the risk of damaging the appeal of its predecessor.\n\n\n\nTina Fey Has Shot Down Rumours Of A 'Mean Girls' Sequel.\n\nFey and Lohan appeared on Jimmy Fallon's first episode of The Tonight Show last month where they addressed the calls for more Means Girls action. The 30 Rock star said that whilst there was an argument for temporarily reuniting the cast - 19th April will mark the film's 10 year anniversary - there was little chance that any plans would be made for another film.\n\n\n\nRachel McAdams: Fans Probably Won't Be Seeing An Onscreen 'Mean Girls' Reunion Soon.\n\nFey said: \"I said to her [Lohan], 'Oh, I think someone may call us about doing some kind of reunion because next month is the 10th anniversary of the movie.' And so really... if everyone's around we might try to do some kind of like panel discussion, but it's not like another movie. At most, it would be like a panel discussion with a plate of hot wings. It's definitely not a movie.\"\n\n\n\nAmanda Seyfried: There May Be A Cast Reunion To Mark The Movie's 10 Year Anniversary.\n\nShe added: \"It's been 10 years. You can tell when you look at me.\" Asked whether she'd written another movie, Fey replied: \"No! I wish I had written a movie. No, it's just [...] Mostly we're trying to get a party going.\"\n\n\n\nLacey Chabert: Fey & Her Husband Are Said To Be Planning A Musical Adaptation Of The Film.\n\nHowever, Tina did reveal that she and her husband, the composer Jeff Richmond, are currently working on a stage musical adaptation of the high school dramedy. Fans of the franchise may remember the 2011 spin-off, Mean Girls 2, which failed to capitalise on the success of its fetch forbearer.\n\n\n\nLindsay Lohan: Fans May Be Eager For More But Fey & Co. Have No Plans For Another Film."}, "possible_content_depth": 5, "Place_dict": {"Place_cluster_0": ["U.S.", "China", "Japan", "the United States", "Pono", "Ukraine", "WASHINGTON", "NEW YORK", "Austin",
